Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

The lecturer warns students about the dangers of plagiarism, highlighting how easy it is for instructors to identify copied code. Plagiarism can ruin a student's academic record and hinder their progress in the course. The lecturer uses an example of plagiarized code to illustrate common mistakes that may give away its origin. The code in question follows an unconventional pattern not taught in the course, and its modularization into separate files is unusual. Upon closer inspection, strange coding practices such as reassigning variables separately can reveal the source of the code. Incorrect use of a for-in loop also gives away the plagiarism. The lecturer emphasizes that most students wouldn't write this code, making it a distinctive characteristic of plagiarized work. Students may try to disguise their own code by changing variable names or comments, but often the inconsistencies are too great to be coincidental. In fact, rewriting the entire code from scratch would be more challenging than using existing plagiarized material. The lecturer encourages students to focus on creating their own original game projects and enjoying the learning process. Plagiarism is a common issue in programming courses, and instructors catch many cases every year. However, plagiarists often don't get the full benefit of the course, missing out on true learning experiences. The lecturer concludes by urging students to prioritize originality and not risk their academic integrity for shortcuts or convenience. By doing so, students can reap the rewards of creating their own code and enjoying the process of game development.

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

The speaker introduces manipulating arrays using for loops as another technique. They use an array called "circles" with 1,000 random integer values between 0 and 100. In their draw function, they instruct the drawing of circles at a random location, ignoring any circle under 10 pixels in size. Circles are drawn in red if bigger than 50 pixels, otherwise blue.

The speaker uses a for loop to iterate over the array, with `var i = 0` and `i < circles.length`. Inside the loop, they use an if statement to check if a circle's size is less than 10. If true, they skip using the `continue` keyword to move on to the next iteration.

They also use another if statement to determine whether to draw in red or blue based on the circle's size. The `continue` keyword allows them to bypass drawing smaller circles.

The speaker draws ellipses at a random location, using the value from the array as the ellipse's size. They only draw ellipses with a width greater than 10 pixels.

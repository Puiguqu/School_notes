## VIDEO TRANSCRIPT ## You may navigate through the transcript using tab. To save a note for a section of text press CTRL + S. To expand your selection you may use CTRL + arrow key. You may contract your selection using shift + CTRL + arrow key. For screen readers that are incompatible with using arrow keys for shortcuts, you can replace them with the H J K L keys. Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key We've got just one more technique that I'm going to show you on manipulating arrays using for loops. So I've got here, very similar to the previous examples, an array, which I've called circles. And I'm filling circles with 1,000 elements with a random value, an integer between 0 and 100. Now, in my draw function, I've little bit of instruction, which is to draw the circles to the canvas at a random location using the circles array for sizes, ignoring any circle under 10 pixels. It also tells me that I should draw circles in red, where they're bigger than 50, and blue otherwise. Okay, so we're going to need a for loop and we're going to have to do some form of selection using if statements to make sure we're only drawing the right circles and in the right color. So let's get started with this. So a for loop. For var i = 0, so normal for loop, same principles as we've used many times now, i is going to be less than circles.length. And we're going to increase i by 1 each time. So let's look at these instructions again. The first thing that it tells us to do is that we don't want to draw any circle that has a pixel size of less than 10. So if I do an if, and let's check for these, so circles i is less than 10. Now, what I'm going to do is show you another little thing we can do with for loops. So, to avoid having quite deeply nested if statements, like we would end up with if we were trying to do this just with ifs. Let's use the continue keyword. The continue keyword will say, okay, skip this iteration in the loop, go back to the start of the for and move on to the next value of i. So, we are going to nothing else with this particular element, we're just going to skip over the for loop. But unlike break, we're going to go back to the top and we're going to carry on running through the different elements. So, we've done that for our if circles less than 10. Now let's do our colors for the other two conditions, so if, now, what was it? Circles in red where they are bigger than 50. So if circles i is greater than 50, then we want to set our fill to be red. Let's put a bit of alpha on here so we can see through them, because we're going to be putting quite a lot of circles to the screen. Otherwise, our fill is going to be blue. 0, 200, and now for as well as 100. All right, that's looking good. I just now need to draw the ellipse. So ellipse, and it was a random location. So, random between 0 and the canvas's width. And also a random value for the y coordinate. And that'd be between 0 and height. And then the size, we're going to use the value from the array, okay. So that hopefully now. >> [INAUDIBLE] >> Okay, this all looks good, so let's save and try and run that. Okay, we've still got a small mistake in here. Let's have a look and see if we can work out where it is. Yeah, so I haven't closed that for loop with another parenthesis. So let's try and save that and run it. And there we go. So a bit of a mad pattern going on on the screen. But none of those ellipses with a width less than 10 are going to be drawn. I'll show you just one other little trick you can do. In your draw loop, if you want to stop it from repeating, so going over frame by frame. If you just want to have it do it once, if at the bottom you type in noLoop, open and close parenthesis, then it will just show us a single frame of the application, the first frame. And we can see the blue and red ellipsis. And if we refresh, we'll get a different pattern, because remember these are all random variables each time. Okay, so that's the end of this little run of videos about using for loops and arrays. Looking at various techniques for selecting particular values, ignoring others, selecting the highest or the lowest. And hopefully now you feel a little bit more confident in using these techniques in your own programs. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 8.1 Two dimensional arrays Lesson 8.2 Nesting objects and arrays Lesson 8.3 patterns Video: Video Find the matching value .

Here is a summary of the content:

**Lesson Summary**

This lesson introduces the `p5` object, specifically the `vector` class. The instructor explains various methods that can be used with this class, including:

1. Creating and manipulating vectors
2. Using static and non-static methods for vector manipulation
3. Randomly generating points to create a pattern

**Key Concepts**

* Understanding the difference between static and non-static methods in `p5`
* Learning how to use various methods to manipulate vectors, such as:
	+ `x`, `y` properties to access individual components of a vector
	+ `length()` method to calculate the magnitude of a vector
	+ `normalize()` method to normalize a vector to length 1
	+ Multiplying and dividing vectors by numbers to scale them

**Example Code**

The instructor provides example code snippets that demonstrate how to use these methods, including:

* Creating and manipulating vectors using static methods
* Randomly generating points to create a pattern
* Using the `normalize()` method to normalize vectors
* Scaling vectors using multiplication and division

**Graded Assignment**

A graded assignment is mentioned, which requires students to practice using the `p5` vector class with various methods.

**Next Steps**

The instructor mentions that in the next lesson, they will explore how to use these methods to create a more complex project, such as creating a Tamagotchi.

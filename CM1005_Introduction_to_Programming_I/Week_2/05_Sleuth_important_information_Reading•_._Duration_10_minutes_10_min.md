Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences:

Sleuth is an educational activity designed to teach programming fundamentals. Students will work as private investigators, solving code crimes in various cases using their programming skills. The chief will provide guidance throughout the journey. Sleuth is a formative tool, meaning it won't directly affect grades but completing all puzzles is highly recommended. Completing the activity serves as a crucial learning experience for grasping basics of programming. Students can access Sleuth through two entry points: Rookie mode in Week 2 and Pro mode in Week 12.

Rookie mode is suitable for novice investigators, while Pro mode offers more advanced cases. Both modes are available at any time, but it's recommended to complete them as outlined in the course schedule. To solve puzzles, students can use either Brackets or Visual Studio Code, but Visual Studio Code is recommended due to its modern and robust features.

The instructor will introduce Sleuth in the next video, and students will embark on their adventure as private investigators. The main mission is to solve code crimes using programming skills, with guidance from the chief throughout the journey. Students can discuss one of the crime puzzles as part of their project submission for this module. Overall, Sleuth aims to provide a structured learning progression for grasping programming basics.

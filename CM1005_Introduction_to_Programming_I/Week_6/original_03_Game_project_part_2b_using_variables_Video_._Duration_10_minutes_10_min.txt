You may contract your selection using shift + CTRL + arrow key. For screen readers that are incompatible with using arrow keys for shortcuts, you can replace them with the H J K L keys. Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key Okay. So now we've drawn our game character, let's move it into the game project C. to this video, if you download the zip file, extract it and open up in brackets, you should see something like this. Say you have a sketch file and README, which is going to show you what to do. The first thing that you want to do when you get the code is to have a good read through it. We need to insert our character from pole A, which you've already, hopefully you just completed and put it into this new sketch. So, I've got mine over here. So, if I copy my game character, from it. Now, I've copy design into a text file. So, I didn't give you any hints as to how to do the other bits but you can copy this straight from brackets from pole A to pole B. So, let's go back to the sketch file and it tells us to puts our game character just at the bottom withdrawal. So, let's paste them in and let's put in a comment. So, draw the game character. We don't want this game character, x and y here, these variables, because we're creating them up here and we are setting them up in setup to be the right value for our scene. So, let's lose these two lines. Very important, make sure you don't have those in yours. Now, if I save and run this, there we go. Our character is now in the scene on the ground. Let's go back to the README file and it tells us to change the value of game character x and y when the mouse is being clipped. So, our character is going to follow around our mouse clicks. Now, this isn't how it's going to be in the actual finished game but it's just an example to get you started. So, let's go to the mouse press function. In here, we want to set these values of game character x and we want that to be equal to mouse x, and game character y. We want that to be equal to mouse y. Okay. So, hopefully if we save and run this now, each time the user presses the mouse, it's going to move our character to match. So, let's go over to our scene and then I can just click round and the character is following my mouse presses. Okay. So, let's have a look at the next bit at this, which is to copy and place the tree code from game project one. So, we're going to copy this code for the function integral and we're going to use a treePos_x and a treePos_y to control the position of the tree in the same way as we've seen with our character. So, let's copy the code. So, let's copy this and let's place it in the sketch. Again, a little comment will just help us to remember where we are. So, draw tree and if I paste that in, let me just remove those previous comments. No, I didn't need to do that because it was already there. That's it. Okay. All right. So, this would draw our tree but it's going to draw it to the side of the sketch and it's not going to use a variable. So, we've got a variable already declared for us up here, which has the tree position x and the tree position y and it's set to the width divided by two and height divided by two. But that's not so important right now. What we need to do is refine our tree code, so that it matches where we want the tree to be drawn. If we take the tree x and y to be this point on our trees, so at the top a trunk. So let's change this rect to be treePos_x and this one to be treePos_y. So, now, our tree is in totally the wrong place. But that's okay because we're going to have to move these as well But what we want to remember, and if we go back to this piece of code over here, I'll just make this a little bigger, so we can see it. If this rectangle here was at 900, 282, all these are the positions are going to be relative to it. So, we're going to have to do quite a bit of maths to get this tree now into the right place. So, let's take each one of these, so with our first triangle, what I suggest you do is comment out the old one and write it in underneath. So, we keep on seeing where we are. So, 850 and we started at 900. So, 900 minus 850 is 50. We're going to have to do the game character underscore x minus 50 for the x. Now, our y is 282- Oh sorry, it's at 332 which is 50 more I think. Let's just check this. Yes, it's 50 more than our tree x or three y, sorry. Actually, I need to make this tree nuts. I knew something wasn't quite right there. So, let's change this, let's make this right. So, this should be a treePos_x minus 50 and let's do treePos_y, and this one was 50 more. So, this is going to be plus 50. Okay. Then, we're going to have a treePos_x and this one's 930. So, that's 30 more, and 232 relative to our 282 is 50 less than our treePos_y, treePos underscore y and this was 50 more, say, minus 50. So, that's the peak of our tree for the first triangle. Let's do the next one, treePos_x. This is 110 more. Say, plus a 110 and then the treePos_y will be the same as the first one. So, that's going to be 50 more. Right. Okay, let's save that. Run it? Whoop! Wow, we can't see anything. That probably means we'd made a mistake. So, let's have a quick look in our inspector, just see what we might have done. Oh, I've spelled triangle wrong. So, let's just fix that. Still something not quite right. Let's have another look; treePos_x is not defined, so I've to correct that. There we go. Right, okay. Well, we've kind of messed it up a little bit but that's going to happen when you do this as well. So, let's see. It looks like it's just the y on this one point I've done wrong. So, the last point. Oh, in fact, it's not quite right because I've put an x here rather than y. So, let's do that. There we go. Some millions of code are just like that. You'll just make lots of mistakes and you'll have to go back over a few times. Okay, so that's the first one. Now, let's have a look at this next one. Luckily, if you remember from the previous time, all the x's are going to be the same as the first one. So, we'll get all those hopefully right, treePos underscore x minus 50. Then, for the first y, treePos_y, let's have a look back at our code. So, it's exactly the same. Look at that. So, we can just use treePos_y for that. That's handy. Okay. So, the next x will be the same as the one we've got here. So, plus 30, treePos_x plus 30, and the y is 100 higher than- there, treePos underscore y. It's exactly here, 100 higher than the treePos_y, so minus 100. Then, the last point, treePos underscore x and we can use the same as we've got up here. So, plus 110 and then the treePos underscore y same as that first point. So, let's save that. Let's see how we've done. There we go. So, there's the first few bits of our game project complete. We can click around here, we've got a tree that's been drawn using variables. For the next stage, you are going to have to put your Canyon in. You're going to be using an object variable for this one and or say your collectible item as well as your mountains and your clouds. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 3.4 Code philosophy: The elegant coder Lesson 3.5: Game project 2: Game character Reading: Reading Code editor: reminder about Visual Studio Code .

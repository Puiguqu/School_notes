Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key Learning to program isn't just about understanding the parts of the code, it's also about having the right mindset. As a programmer, your job is not just the writer of code, you're also a problem solver. However, along with that comes some real challenges that catch out a lot of students who are just starting to code. When you write some code and try to run it, you probably won't have just got it right the 1st time, nor probably in the 2nd time, or in fact, sometimes, the 28th time. This is an inevitable part of programming, however, it's not a bad thing. And working through problems will help you to learn and to become a better programmer. Sometimes when you get really lost in one of those problems, we have to look at things from a different angle and change our way of thinking. By changing mindset, not only will you learn more about coding, and the process of developing software, you'll learn more about the problem you are trying to solve. Write less buggy code, and discover more elegant solutions to the task. Please, don't believe all the programmer hype. If your only experience of programmers is Hollywood films, you would think there are a different species all together, able to complete the impossible without looking up from their keyboards. It doesn't work like that, coders are human beings. Human beings that make mistakes, and work through their challenges slowly at their own pace. Identifying where and why your codes doesn't work is an important part of being able to call yourself a programmer. The best strategy is to be prepared and to fail well. Firstly, don't give up, when codes doesn't work, it's time to take off your programmer's baseball cap, put on your detective fedora and start one pick what's going wrong. In this module, you will learn techniques to help solve errors as well as to write programs. We'll learn how to organize code, to minimize errors, and how to find and correct these errors when they do occur. We'll also learn where the web browser displays errors to the programmer. This process is known as debugging, and it's a big part of programming. This might all be sounding quite negative, and you haven't even written your first line of code yet. Well, actually it's not, coding is about trial and error and challenging yourself to achieve complicated and intellectual demanding things. That is a really exciting challenge and very rewarding. There is little better feeling than getting a complex piece of code to work. One last thing, it doesn't matter how long you've been coding for, you never stop learning to program. And the more you do, the better you get. It's our goal that the end of this module, you will not only have learnt the fundamental skills of programming. You will have also developed the mindset to carry on granule programming skills throughout this course and your future careers. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 1.0 Introduction Video: Video Welcome to the course and about us .

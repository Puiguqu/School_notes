## VIDEO TRANSCRIPT ## You may navigate through the transcript using tab. To save a note for a section of text press CTRL + S. To expand your selection you may use CTRL + arrow key. You may contract your selection using shift + CTRL + arrow key. For screen readers that are incompatible with using arrow keys for shortcuts, you can replace them with the H J K L keys. Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key In this video, I'm going to show you how to run your first sketch and edit it using the Brackets IO editor. Now the first thing that you need to do, is download the example sketch from the Coursera platform. I've already got one here on my laptop. The next thing you're going to need to do, is to extract the file because it's a zip file. So if you're on a Mac, all you need to do is double-click the file and the folder will open. On other platforms, you might need to do something different, but in any case you won't need to download any extra software to do this. Okay. So looking into the folder, we can see that there are three files and I'm going to talk you through these files now. The first file is an index.html. We have this because every p5 js sketch is actually a web page. We're going to use this to run our file in a moment. The second one is the p5.min.js file, this is where all the library code for p5 js is stored. The final file is the sketch.js file, this is the only file that we'll edit during our time on intro to programming. The important point is that, we need all three files to run our sketch and they need to stay in this folder. Okay. I'm going to show you a quick way to run a sketch. The way we do this, is we go to the index.html file, and if you're on a Mac you can do a contextual click and you can choose Open With and you can choose your favorite browser be it Chrome or Safari or Firefox, and open the index.html file with that browser. There we go, we've run the sketch. But actually what we're going to want to do, is we're going to want to edit our sketch.js file. For that, we're going to need to do a couple of other things. Now, you might be tempted to open this file with something like Word or Notepad or TextEdit, but this would be a really bad idea. These programs are not designed for editing code. To edit code, we need to download a specific code editor. The one we're going to use, is called Brackets IO. You can find it by going to brackets.io. It's an open source free software. You can just download it by clicking this button. The install procedure should be pretty simple no matter what platform you're on. Once you've downloaded that, we need to open your sketch and there's a specific way in which you need to do this. So the first thing you do, is actually open the Brackets editor. Once the editor is open, you're going to find probably that you get these default files, but we're going to ignore these. The next thing we need to do, is not open an individual file, we need to open the whole folder for the p5 js sketch. There's two ways to do this, I'm going to show you both. The first way, is that you simply drag the folder into this bar on the left. There the sketch is open. The other way you can do it, is you can go to the file menu and you can go to open folder, then you can navigate your way to the p5 js sketch. So here it is on my desktop, and I can open it. Once you've done that, you can access your three files there. I'm going to click on sketch.js because that's the one we're actually going to edit. So there's another way of running our sketch, and that's within the Brackets editor. The way you do this, is you click the lightening symbol on the right-hand side of the screen. This now opens what's called a live preview. This operates slightly different from when we just clicked on the index.html file. Let me show you how this works. I'm going to make some changes in my codes. So what I'm going to do, is I'm going to change the background color. Will go into how this works in more detail in later videos. I'm just going to change the color now from black to red. You can see as soon as I save the changes using command and S, we can see the change happening in the live preview window. I could make some other changes as well. I'll try moving the rectangle by changing this number. So there's a couple of things that might go wrong whiles you're trying this process as well, and I'm going to talk you through some of those now. One of the things that might happen, is that you end up editing the wrong file. To show you this, I'm going to need to make a copy of my sketch. So we have two sketches here. I'm going to open the Brackets editor. I'm going to start the live preview. Whilst about life previews running, I'm going to also start working on a second file. So now I have two sketch js files. What happens, I will start making some changes. But we don't see anything changing in the live preview window. The reason we don't see anything, is that we're actually working on the wrong file. So watch out for that one. Another problem that can happen, is that you open the file the wrong way. So if I close brackets again and I'm just going to try and open a single files. So I'm going to open just this and I'm going to go open with brackets. When I try and run this sketch, I'll get this live preview error appearing. That's because I haven't opened the folder with all three files, I've just opened the individual file. So I won't be able to run my sketch. The correct way to do it, is to drag the whole folder in and then when I run my sketch, it will be able to run. The final error that you might find, is if there's something wrong with your code. So I'll make a small error in my code. Then what you'll most likely see is just a blank white screen. When you see that, you probably know that you have something wrong in your code and you're going to need to fix up before you can view your sketch. We're going to deal with how to do that in a later video in this topic. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 1.0 Introduction Lesson 1.1 Introduction to p5.js Reading: Reading Code editor: important information .

And this is also your midterm assignment. Now the first thing to say is that to do this bit of the game project, you're going to need three other parts of the game project ready to go. You're going to need part 2A which is where you made the game character. Part 2B which is where you did lots of variables with your background items. And you're going to need part 3B which is where you've got your character interacting with canyons and coins. So I've got them all on my desktop here. I suggested you the same and I've also downloaded the read me file which has got the full instructions that comes along with this video. And the first thing I'm going to do is exactly what it says. I'm going to copy this freebie folder. And I'm going to rename it. I'm going to call it game project 4. Its really advisable to do this straight away. Every year I see people submitting the wrong version, the wrong part of the game project for the midterm assignment and that results in really bad marks. So rename that. So there's no confusion and the next thing I'm going to do is actually just drag this, read me into there so that I've got everything all in one place. Okay, now I'm going to drag and drop game project 4 and I'll have my sketch ready to go and my read me instructions. Let's even change the title here. Game project part 4 side scrolling is what it's called. So we can't get confused. Let's type it, right? Great. Okay, now the first thing we're going to do here is, well let's run the sketch first and just see what we've got just to remind you. So if you've done this correctly, you should have your character able to jump up and down, get the collectible, jump over the canyon and also fall down it correctly. So if you've got all of that going, you're ready to go. So the first thing we're going to do is we're going to make an array of tree positions. So if you're not sure what an array is, go back to those videos and watch those first. So we're going to declare a variable. It's going to be a global variable. So we're going to do this up at the top. I'm going to call it bar trees underscore x. And if we look further on, we need to initialize it with an array of numbers. So we need a bunch of numbers in here and these numbers are going to represent where the tree goes. So let's do that. I'm going to do it just down here. I'm going to say trees, x equals and I'm going to put in some numbers. I'm just going to make them a bit random for the moment. I'm going to sort of imagine that there's a tree. I don't know here and here and here and here. You see where I'm pointing with my mouse? I'm actually pointing off the screen and you'll see in a minute that that is going to make sense. So let's do that. I'm going to put 300,500,900, 1000,150. That's probably enough. Okay, now the next thing I'm going to do is it says that I need to create a four loop inside the draw function that traverses over these numbers. So I'm going to go to my code now and I'm going to do this and I'll show you a little trick to test but it's working. So I'm going to put it in here after I've drawn the ground and I'm going to type this four loop for var I equal 0. So that's the initialization. I is less than trees x.length. Okay, so that will mean that this is called the condition if you remember rightly, it's when we stop. And because I've used the length property of the array, it doesn't matter how many trees I've got in there. It's always going to iterate the right number of times. And finally, I do the afterthought, which is i plus plus or i plus equals 1 if you prefer but increment i by one every time. And if I want to check that this is working, I could just use a console dot log to see if I get the numbers. So I'm going to type trees loop and I'm going to see if I get the number i out correctly. It should cycle which should go 0123 repeatedly because this is a neutral function so it happens over and over again. So I'm going to go back to my code. I'll just refresh it and I'm going to open up the console and here we can see 0123,0123,0123. So my loop is working. Okay, let's look at the next stage of the instructions. What am I to do? I need to now dive into part 2B. And we've got to get the trees drawing code. So a nice way to do this is to get a second window for my brackets. And if you don't know where to do this, it's in a weird place. It's in the debug menu and here you can see I can do open a new brackets window and this just can help me work with multiple files. So I'm going to get the part from 2B my trees. And here, I need to find the tree drawing code. Here is my tree drawing code. Now if you've done this correctly, you should find that it's using tree pose x. And maybe tree pose y as well all the way through. So I'm going to get this code and I'm going to cut and paste it, copy and paste it into my trees loop. But this isn't going to work just yet. We'll see y in a moment. So I'm going to save this and now you'll see, we're starting to get errors and this is because tree pose x is not defined. And we so then we need to actually do the next stage and we need to make sure that we're using our new trees x values. And if you look here, the way it tells you to do it is by using trees x at the index i. So everywhere we see tree pose x. We need to put trees x. And then we need to reference it with i, okay? So I'm going to just do a few of these like this. Make sure you don't do the y ones like that, because there's no variable like that. Here we go. So obviously, actually doing a find and replace would be better if you have lots and lots of variables. Okay, I think I've caught all of them. Let's see if our code runs, okay? It still doesn't run because we've got another sneaky error which is, we need to have a tree pose y. So I haven't got that in an array at the moment and that's fine. I don't have to use an array in this case. So what I'm going to do is, I'm going to copy the code here that makes tree pose y. I'll make sure I'll do a declaration as well and we'll kind of do a mixed approach. So there'll be one tree pose y but there's multiple expositions. Okay, I've got my declaration. I've got my initialization there. Let's save the file. And you can see magically, we have a whole bunch of trees now. So our game world is filling out. Now you might be wondering why you would make trees in the kind of offscreen space. And what I'll do is I'll just show you where we're going to end up with this game project with the finished version, what you're aiming for. So I'm just going to bear with me open up my folder there, let's get this going side scrolling. So here is the complete version and you can see now our character can move along quite nicely and interact and we've got an expansive game world. So that's what you're aiming for. I've obviously gone through a short amount of it. In this video, I'm going to introduce to you game project part four side scrolling.

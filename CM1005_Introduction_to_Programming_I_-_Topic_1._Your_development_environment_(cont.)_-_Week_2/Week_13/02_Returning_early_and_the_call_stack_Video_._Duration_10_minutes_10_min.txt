The provided text is a transcript of an educational video or presentation on the topic of functions in programming, specifically discussing user-defined functions, returning early from a function, and debugging techniques.

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **User-Defined Functions**: The importance of using functions to organize code, improve readability, and reduce repetition.
2. **Returning Early from a Function**: How to use the `return` keyword to exit a function prematurely, useful for handling edge cases or stopping execution early.
3. **Call Stack**: Understanding how the call stack represents the sequence of function calls and returns, helping with debugging and tracking code execution.
4. **Debugging Techniques**: Strategies for identifying and fixing errors in functions, including using a debugger, print statements, and logical thinking.

**Learning Objectives:**

1. Understand the purpose and benefits of user-defined functions.
2. Learn how to use `return` keywords to control function execution.
3. Recognize the role of the call stack in understanding code flow.
4. Develop skills in debugging techniques for identifying and fixing errors in functions.

**Target Audience:** This content is suitable for beginners or intermediate learners of a programming language, such as JavaScript, Python, or C++. It aims to provide foundational knowledge on functions, debugging, and error handling, essential skills for any programmer.

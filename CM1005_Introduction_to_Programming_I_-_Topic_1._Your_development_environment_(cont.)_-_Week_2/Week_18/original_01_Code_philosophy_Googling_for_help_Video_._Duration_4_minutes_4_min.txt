You have probably used a search engine to help you solve your bugs and help understand coding techniques. Hopefully, you're probably beginning to see patterns emerging on the best way to ask the internet to solve your problems. It doesn't matter which search engine you use, you still need to be able to tailor your question to be searchable. Coding leads to unique problems because we are overwriting unique programs. Therefore, you will be asking a question that no one has ever asked before. However, that doesn't mean that the answer isn't out there on the web. It means we have to extract the generic information out to the problem and ask the search engine for help. Let's look at a simple console output. By now, this won't be an instant one to Google. You should have spotted the line number and worked out what's going wrong. But let's go through the motions with it to illustrate the point. It might be tempting to just copy and paste the console output into the search engine and click the magic button. However, if I do this, I'm only going to get back a couple of answers four in fact with this example. The problem here is the variable name. The chances are, no one would have had this exact problem with this variable name. So let's just remove that bit from the search. That's much better. I've gone from four results to over 300,000. I'm going to be able to get a good answer now. This is because I've removed the piece of the search specific to my problem, but broadened it out to the generic era provided by JavaScript. This is another thing I see students dig. In a bit of a panic, they have copied and pasted a long chunk of code out of their program and straight into the search engine. This really isn't going to go well. For much the same reasons, you need to break down the code and work out where the issue is and search around the specific problem. A slightly different issue now. Say you are searching for a particular technique. Here I'm looking for how to reverse a string. I'm getting an awful lot of results and quite a few aren't relevant to me because they aren't about JavaScript. A quick and simple approach is to include the name of the language, "JavaScript" for us. This limits the results, but be careful you don't pick up a Java answer, it's a very different language to JavaScript. One last thing, to keep an eye out for is good websites with reliable information and try to use them when they come up in search engines. For web development with JavaScript, I'm a big fan of the Mozilla Developer Network. There is also a W3 schools. Other slides such a StackOverflow are very useful too. However, be careful with user provided content. Make sure you check the upvotes and that the answer is a good one. This topics' core philosophy is to make sure that your web searches yield the best results. generic terms specific to your problems and make sure you only use the best quality results. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 9.3 Code Philosophy Video: Video Code philosophy: Googling for help .

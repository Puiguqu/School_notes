We can see from the description, the instructions, that we've got to identify several bad guys and we can identify them based on their row and seat number. And, we'll also discover that the members of the order have a particular trademark item of clothing that they're wearing and in this case for my sleuth, I've got a bowtie that I'm going to be looking for and that's going to help us out. When we run the sketch, we will probably just see a lot of darkness shrouding the crowd and we're going to use the spotlight again to identify them. If we look at this image in the PNG in brackets, we can probably make out that some of these characters will be wearing a bow tie, see if I can spot one. There's a tie there, there's a tie there, there's a tie there, there's a tie there. In fact there is the bow tie, just there. So let's go back to the sketch file, and we can see we've got a great big object full of all the people who are sitting in the audience and this is a two dimensional array. And each one has an x and y location and also whether they have been located, so an extra property that is set to false. So our job is going to be to set these particular members of the gang their property, their located property, to true. So I'm just going to copy these from the comments and I'm going to put them down where we have to add our code. So let's paste them in, and also if we comment those out, so JavaScript knows not to run it. Then I can go through this big object that's called stalls, yours will be called something different. And I can set the various members of the gang, they're located property to tree. Now in this first level, you don't need to use a FOR loop, but in all subsequent levels you will need to use a FOR loop. In fact, sometimes you will need to use a nested FOR loop, but for now we can just do, we can just assign each of these bad guys the property to true. So, the first one is on the fifth row and the second seat and we need to find the name of the property which is located and set that equal to true. And then the next one, so stalls, stalls not stall. Let’s just make that stalls. And the next one is in the eighth row and the second seat, set their dot located property equal to true. And if we save that, we can now see we've got two people identified. And I've Not got this quite right, I don't think, because we can see they're not wearing bow ties. So let's count down. So the first row, now see what we have done here, is I've just used these numbers without thinking about counting from the index of zero. So if they're in the fifth row, they're actually going to be in location number 4 and their seat will be 1. And the next one here, if they're in the eighth row, their row will be 7 and that seat will be 1, so let's save that. And now we can see these two characters are wearing bow ties, so we've got them right. Let's just put in a couple of more of these. So the first row, fourth seats, so that's going to be 0, 3, set that property of located = true. And the next one is also in the first row. So, 0 and the property is, sorry the other index is going to be four and then the property located equal to true. So let's save that, okay so we've now detected four members of the gang. There's a few more to do there, but it's the same process again. So let's go over to Sleuth and let's upload this and see what it's telling us, how we've done. So, let's open the sketch file, click Open and submit solution. And it's giving us about just under 40% because we remembered four of the gang and we need to try and find the others before it will let us pass. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 9.3 Code Philosophy Lesson 9.4 Game project 7: make it awesome Lesson 9.5 Continuing with Sleuth Video: Video Sleuth case by case 801 .

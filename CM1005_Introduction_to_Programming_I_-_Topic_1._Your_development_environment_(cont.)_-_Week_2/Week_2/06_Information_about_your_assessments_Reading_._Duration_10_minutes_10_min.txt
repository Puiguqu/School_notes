Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

The module will contain various summative and formative assessments. Summative assessments directly contribute to the final grade, while formative assessments provide low-stakes practice opportunities with feedback on progress. The course has two major assessments, each worth 50% of the grade: Coursework 1 and Coursework 2. Each coursework consists of a project, with Coursework 1 assessed halfway through the course (around Week 12) and Coursework 2 assessed at the end of the course (around Week 22). There are also several graded activities that have zero weighting, meaning they do not contribute to the final grade but are essential for learning.

These activities include Lesson 1.2 Introduction to Sleuth, Lesson 1.3 Code Philosophy, and Lesson 1.4 About your assessments, as well as Reading: Reading Information about your assessments and Reading: Reflect on your learning. The duration of these activities is approximately 10 minutes each. Additionally, there are two other reading activities: Reading: Reading Information about your assessments and Reading: Reflect on your learning.

The estimated time per week for each activity is not specified, but they are considered essential components of the module. The course aims to provide a detailed breakdown of all marks and assessment details. Students should mark as completed, dislike, or report an issue with any activities or assignments.

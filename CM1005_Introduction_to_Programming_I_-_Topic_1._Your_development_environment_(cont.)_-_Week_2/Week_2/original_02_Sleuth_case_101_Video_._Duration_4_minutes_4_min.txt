We're going to start with the first stage which is called central stations. So, here I am on the Sleuth and Co crime's page, and I'm going to click on Central Station. The next thing I'm going to do is I'm going to download a crime. So, I click there and I now open that in the Finder, and I'm going to unzip the file. The next thing I'm going to do is open this project in brackets. The way I do that is I take the whole folder and I drag it into this left bar here. Then I look at the sketch.js file. That's where I can see the instructions for how I solved this crime. So, it says that a well-known impresarios suspects for their star at Lina Lovelace is involved with some no-good unsavory characters. What we've got to do is we've got to trail her and identify who she meets. The way we trail her is we draw a rectangle around her. So, we've got this image that's provided. If we look at this image, we can see Lina standing there at the railway station. So, the task is to draw a rectangle around her. If we look back at the instructions, we are told that we should use the rect command to do that. If we look down, we can see that we're to do this inside the draw function below this comment here. So, the first thing we need is the coordinates for the top left hand corner of Lina. So, I'm going to find this. Now, brackets helps us by giving us this really useful tool. So, when we view an image, we get these cross hairs and it tells us the xy coordinates of where those cross hairs are. So, if I move my mouse to this top left point here, I think that my rectangle should start at position 18, 195. So, I'm going to go back to my sketch, and I'm going to type rect(18,195). At for the moment, I'm just going to make the rectangle a 100 by a 100. I know that's wrong, but I just want to see that I've got to at least starting in the right place. So, I'm going to run my sketch by pressing the live preview button. There we can see our rectangle is way too small. If I was to upload this, I wouldn't get full marks. Sleuth would tell me off, it would tell me that my rectangle is too small. But I'm not going to do that, I'm just going to get it the right size. So, I reckon in order to get all of Lina inside, It needs to be double the width. So, I'm going to go back to my code here, and we will make this 200 wide. Let's see what happens. Okay, it's little bit wide, but we won't worry about that for the moment. Now, I reckon it needs to be one, two, three. I reckon 400 high. Let's see. Okay. So, the rectangle is currently a bit big. Let's trim it down a bit. I think that that should be 180. Let's see. Yes, that looks right. This is a bit long. We really do need to be quite accurate for this assignment. I think 375. Let's see if that works. I think that I'm relatively happy with that. So, let's upload the sketch and see if the grader is happy with us. So, I've clicked on the browse button, I've selected sketch.js. You can see the case number here. That means that that has worked. I'm going to submit my solution. Brilliant. We solved the case. We correctly identified Lina Lovelace. The next thing will happen is the chief will tell us we passed the first stage. Don't let her out on your site. But there let us see you. Let's see where she heads next. So, the next thing you can do if you solve this is to move on to Small Talk Speakeasy. So, that's how to get started with Case 101. Now it's your turn. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 1.2 Introduction to Sleuth Reading: Reading Sleuth: important information .

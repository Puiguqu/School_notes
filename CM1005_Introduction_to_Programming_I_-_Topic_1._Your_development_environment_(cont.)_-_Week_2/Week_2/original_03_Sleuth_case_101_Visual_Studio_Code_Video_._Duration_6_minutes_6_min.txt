As in, we're going to see how you can solve one of the Sleuth crimes. But instead of using the Brackets coding editor, we will use Visual Studio Code. Now, a quick overview for this lecture. So we're going to get started with Sleuth and Visual Studio Code. We will download and inspect case 101 from the Sleuth application. Then we will inspect the case, run the code, solve it using Visual Studio Code and finally, we will upload the result on the Sleuth application for feedback. Now, without further ado, let's jump together inside the Sleuth application. So as you can see, I am in the home page of the Sleuth application. The first thing you want to do, you want to click on "Let's solve some crimes," and we're going to solve the very first case of the series 101, the one that's called central station. So if you click on it, by the way, you can see I have already solved this puzzle, but I'm going to do it once again with you because why not? It's fun. So you want to click on " crime" first. So click on it, and this will download a zip file containing all the elements you need to solve this puzzle. The next thing is you want to locate the zip file, and you want to unzip it. Then with Visual Studio Code open, you just want to drag the folder inside Visual Studio Code, and this will open the folder inside Visual Studio Code. Now, let's very briefly inspect the files here. So you can see there is an image. Now, as before, you have to trust that this folder is safe for you to open in Visual Studio Code. Trust me it's safe. You can go ahead and do that. So click on "Yes, I trust the authors." Then let's take a look at the files. So there is an image of a lady, which we will use to solve the crime. There is the usual index.html, containing the web page skeleton. There is also the P5 JS containing all the functionalities of the P5 JS library. But most importantly, there is the sketch.js. This is the actual crime that we have to solve. As you saw before, the idea for this puzzle is to draw a rectangle around in this case, a person called Anna. So we need to draw a rectangle using the rect function around the body of Anna. So the next thing you have to do is to run this case. We can do this very easily as you learn from the previous lecture, so we can use the live server extension. So just as before, click on the "Go Live" button at the bottom of the page and load the sketch into your browser. So you can see that we have a lady right there, and we have to draw a rectangle around her body. Now, luckily, the sketch comes with a very handy feature. You can see as you move the mouse around, you can see the x and y coordinates for this sketch. So what we want to do, we want to start drawing our rectangle from the top left hand side corner. So I'd say we can probably start around this position, which is 70 pixels across and 45 pixels down. So I'll try to remember the coordinates, 70, 45. So back to the sketch, when we have to add the code, and there is a message that says, write your code below here, we are going to write the rect function with the initial coordinates, which were 70, 45. Then the next two parameters of this function is how wide your rectangle should be and how tall. So I'm just going to guess at the beginning. So I think it should be roughly 100 pixels wide and perhaps 400 pixels long. Let's try this, and let's save the sketch. So you can save the sketch by, I'm on a Mac. You can press "Command S" if you're on the Mac, you can press "Control S" if you're on windows. Or you can click on "File" at the top and "Save". So this has been saved. Let's go back. We can see we did pretty well, so it's way too long. So we have to make it a little bit wider and shorter. So I'd say we can do something like 120 and perhaps 350 pixels long. Still very long in terms of width, we're kind of there a little bit more. So we'll do 125, and we want to reduce the height by quite a lot. Let's do 125, 250, and this is a pretty decent attempt. So I'd say, I'm happy with this. Let's now see how we can upload this back on these Sleuth application. So we want to go back to the Sleuth application, and now you want to click on "Browse". So you click on "Browse", and you want to select the sketch.js that you want to upload. So mine was inside the downloads folder, and I want to select the "Sketch" and click on "Open". As you can see, this has been uploaded to the Sleuth, and now you want to click on " solution". Now, let's click on it, and we got 100%. Happy days. We made it. That's how you can do and solve the Sleuth puzzles using Visual Studio Code. Now, back to the slides for a quick wrap up. Great. So in this lecture, you've learned how to solve Sleuth puzzles using Visual Studio Code. Now I recommend you using Visual Studio Code from now on because it's a modern coding editor, and it's also the coding editor that you will be using for other modules in the degree. So go ahead, solve as many Sleuth puzzles as you can. Remember, those are very, very important because they teach you the basics. They teach you the core fundamental aspects of programming. So go ahead, have fun, and solve more Sleuth puzzles. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 1.2 Introduction to Sleuth Reading: Reading Sleuth: important information .

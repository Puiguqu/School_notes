Coders don't just care about what their programs do, they care about how their programs do it. Just as mathematicians search for elegance in their solutions, coders aim to write elegant code. But, what is elegant code? Is elegant code concise? The artist and musician, Fredrik Olofsson, produces tweet length fragments of code that produce the intricate music such as you're hearing now. It really is quite remarkable to think that these 240 characters produced this music. Such work is a masterclass in concision, but whilst it's great art, coders would not call it elegant. Is elegant code clever? The code on the left produces the maze game on the right. The visual maze rendered by the white space in the code, and the maze in the game are one and the same. This is the winning entry from the 2004 obfuscated C competition. Here, programmers compete to create the most dastardly and tortuously clever code in the language C. Now, whilst this program is certainly masterful and clever, it would fail any program's test for elegance. Antoine Saint-Exupery said, "Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there's nothing left to take away." So, elegant code is as simple as it can be. Elegant code is readable. Coders aim for well named variables, good use of objects, logical organization, and explanatory comments. Redundancy, on the other hand, is not elegant. Coders try to avoid commented out blocks of unused code, unused variables, drawn images that can't be seen. Elegant code also follows conventions. Coders make sure that they align brackets, and that they indent that code between those brackets by one's hub. When lines get very long, coders often break things onto separate lines, and coders like to use comments, but have to do some fixed means to plan their work. Now, of course, there's much more to writing elegant code than these rules alone, and as your knowledge develops so will your sense of what is elegant code. These guidelines give you a good stop. It takes some practice to use them consistently. So, try to be elegant in every line of code that you write no matter how trivial. So, this week's mantra is always be an elegant coder. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 3.4 Code philosophy: The elegant coder Video: Video Code philosophy: the elegant coder .

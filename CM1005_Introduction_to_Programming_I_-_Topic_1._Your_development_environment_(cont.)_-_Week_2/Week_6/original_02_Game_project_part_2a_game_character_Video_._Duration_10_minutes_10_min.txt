Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key So, in this video, I'm going to get you started with game project part two which is drawing a game character. So, the first thing to do is just to download the sketch from the platform and run the sketch. So, if we do that, you can see that we get these boxes, and inside these boxes, this is where we're going to draw various versions of our game character. So, you can see the first one is going to be standing facing the front. Then the next one is going to be an image for when the game character jumps, and the next one for walking left, walking right, jumping to the right, and jumping to the left. So, when we put these into our game we're going to get a really nice effect as we move in different ways in the game. This will become like an animated figure to some degree. So, looking at the code, you will see that we have two variables, gameChar_x and gameChar_y. These variables are really important. We're going to be using them all the way through the game project. So, it's really important that you use these in the drawing of your character, and I'm going to show you how to do that. So, if you look at the first bit of code which is for drawing our game character stand facing forward, so you can see that helpfully, I have set gameChar_x and gameChar_y two values. Do not change these. What you need to do is you need to add your drawing code where it says add your code here. So, I'm just going to start by looking at what these coordinates are relative in the image. So, I'm going to draw an ellipse, and I'm going to draw it exactly where gameChar_x and gameChar_y are. I'll make this ellipse pretty small, and let's just fill it as black. So, if you look at the output, you will now see that that ellipse is right at the bottom of where the image is and in the center. That's going to be the principal for whenever we draw our game character, we're always going to start with an anchor point that's in the middle at the bottom. So, what I now need to do is I want to start drawing this character. So, imagine I want to draw a head. So, I'm going to make this head some kind of pinky color for skin. So, I'll probably make it, let's try quite a bit of red, let's say actually 200, and I'll make the other ones 100 and 100. So, we should hopefully get some pinky color. I'm going to draw another ellipse, and for the moment, I'll just go make it gameChar_x and gameChar_y and then we can adjust its position shortly. I want this one to be bigger. So, I'm going to say that this one is going to have a diameter of, well, let's try 25 and see what that looks like. So, now we've got our ellipse, it's not quite how I want, it's a little bit small, and I don't think I'm quite happy with the color. I think I'm going to make it a little bit lighter, and I will make it slightly bigger. So, I was still not adjusting the position. I'm relatively happy with that. So, now what we want to do is we want to get this ellipse from the bottom up to really towards the top of this rectangle. So, well, to do that, rather than changing gameChar_y, I'm going to take something away from it. So, I'm going to make this ellipse be drawn relative to that point gameChar_x, gameChar_y. So, I'm going to take off, let's try taking off 50. Well, that looks perfect to me. So, I've got my ellipse there and now I need to draw maybe the body of the character. So, I'm going to draw the body in red. So, I'll go fill 255, 0, 0, and here what I think I'll do is I'll use a rectangle. So, now, I'll just start drawing the rectangle naively and then we can deal with the position in a moment. So, I'm going to say again gameChar_x, gameChar_y. I know that's wrong but we'll just see what we get and then we can adjust from there. The width I think I'll make 50 and the height, I'll maybe make a 100. Let's have a look at what we've got. So, there's lots of things wrong with that. It's clearly too big, and we also can see that the position of a rectangle is wrong. Let's adjust the size first. So, I think it could almost be half the size than the one I chose. I reckon that will work a lot better. Now, you can see that the rectangle is drawn from its top left-hand corner, so that we know that that black dot is where gameChar_x and gameChar_y is. So, actually, the first thing we want to do is we want to get it so that it's drawn in the middle, so that that black dot is in the middle of the rectangle. So, what we need to do is we need to take off half the width of the rectangle from gameChar_x. So, if I've got 25, well, let's make it an even number so that this is easier to do. So, I'm going to make the width 26, and I'm going to minus 13, which is half of 26 from gameChar_x. If we look back at our sketch, we can now see it's perfectly drawn in the middle. So, that's one thing. Now we need to make it so that it's at the right height. Well, again, we need to minus some value from gameChar_y. So, I'm going to just do this by a bit of guesstimating. So, I'm going to start with the 30. Let's see what happens. Well, okay. That's nearly right. I think it could be a little bit more though. Let's try 35. I think that that's good, but now we can see that actually our character's body is still a bit too long, isn't? Because it goes outside of the box. So, instead of making it 52, well, let's try making it 32. I'm much happier with that. So, the final thing I might want to do here is draw some feet for my character. So, I'm going to fill it again in black, and I'm going to draw a rectangle, and I want this one to be really small. But again, I'm going to start at gameChar_x and gameChar_y. Let's just make it 10 pixels by 10 pixels. Let's see what that looks like. Great. That's a tiny little rectangle. So, now we need to move it in order to put it in the right place, and where I want it to be is on the left hand side, nestled under the body of the character. So, I think what I'm first going to do is to adjust the height this time. So, I think I'm going to minus 10 and see if that works. That was a little bit high, you can see. So, I just need to minus something slightly less, lets try five. That looks perfect to me. Now, I need to move it across to the left. So, I'm going to minus something from the gameChar_x, I think I'm going to minus 13, and that puts it perfectly at the left in line with the body. But I think I want it to go little bit further out. So, let's minus, well, let's minus 18 and see how that looks. Well, that looks like too far for me. So, we'll go somewhere in between, minus 15. That's great. I'm quite happy with that foot. So, now to do the other foot, actually, all we want to do is a symmetrical thing on the other side. So, I'm going to copy and paste that code, and instead of minusing 15, I plus 15, and I forgotten something now, so that's not quite right because the foot's further over because we draw the foot from the left-hand side. So, I'm actually going to have to take off the width of the rectangle to make this work. So, I think I should be plus five. There we go. We can see that our feet are perfectly aligned. So, the only thing left to do is to get rid of that ellipse that we drew at the beginning because we were really only drawing that for reference. So, I can just comment out these two lines, and there we go. My first game character drawing is done. So, now you've got the, it's up to you to work out how to draw the other ones. So, maybe for this one, you would want to make the body shorter somehow or put arms out to signify jumping. Maybe here you would want to do like a thin ellipse, and show the character facing to one side, and the same here. Here maybe you want to do a combination of both things to make this work. But what you're aiming for is for the identifiably looks like the same character. The other thing I should say about this exercise is don't make your code too complicated at this stage because we're going to need to cut and paste this code lots of times. So, I would suggest something like trying to draw your character in about 10 to 15 lines of code. If you're going beyond that, you're probably going to find some of the later stages really difficult. So, now it's your turn, best of luck. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 3.4 Code philosophy: The elegant coder Lesson 3.5: Game project 2: Game character Reading: Reading Code editor: reminder about Visual Studio Code .

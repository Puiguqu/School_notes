## VIDEO TRANSCRIPT ## You may navigate through the transcript using tab. To save a note for a section of text press CTRL + S. To expand your selection you may use CTRL + arrow key. You may contract your selection using shift + CTRL + arrow key. For screen readers that are incompatible with using arrow keys for shortcuts, you can replace them with the H J K L keys. Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key So, in this video, I'm going to show you how to get started with Case 303. That's the case of the Crooked Attorney. So, let's go straight to Torvalds Office. We're going to download the crime that happened there. So, you know the deal, unzip the folder, open brackets, and drag the folder into brackets. Okay. Let us look at what we've got here. Well, District Attorney Torvalds is well respected in Console City as an upstanding citizen and enforcer of the law. But of course he's as crooked as they come. What we have to do is we have to find some incriminating documents and he's got them in various safes. But he's hidden them across town. So, we're going to have to break into them. Okay. So, we've got a lot of instructions, a lot of commands, things that we have to do in order to crack this safe. They seem to involve these variables, Cryptic_Store_CombA and Cryptic_Store_CombB. Now remember, your puzzle won't be exactly the same as mine. So, your variable names might be slightly different. Your instructions here might be slightly different. You can't copy this video exactly. Okay. So, first things first, let's run the sketch. Okay. We can see our safe here. I was thinking maybe it's interactive but at the moment, nothing happens. So, let's try and crack this safe. Let's see what we need to do. I'm going to do a little bit of it now, and then maybe we'll try and mark it. So, when the mouse button is released, so we need an event for the mouse button release. Let's have a look down here. Look, mouseReleased. Let's just see that working. So, I'm going to open the console. There it is at the bottom, and you can see mouseMoved happening. Let's just try the mouseReleased. So, mousePressed, mouseReleased. So, what do we have to do? We are told where mouse button is released, make Cryptic_Store_CombA equal to 16. Here is a little tip. Copy the instructions into your code and comment them. That way is so much easier. You don't scroll up and down the whole time and you can really error check. Well, it's good coding practice. So, this is all we have to do. Now, Cryptic_Store_CombA is 16 when we release the button. Let's see what that actually does on our sketch. So, I'm going to refresh that sketch. Did you see? Is moved to 16 when I released the button. Let's do a couple more. Cryptic_Store_CombA a is equal to five when the mouse is being dragged. Let's look mouseDragged, and again I copied and pasted this here. Oops, don't do that. Cryptic_Store_CombA equals five when the mouse is dragged. Let's try that. So, I'm going to go back to my safe. So, I release the mouse and it is 16. I drag the mouse, and it's a five. Cool. So, we've done two. I'm going to do one more for you, and then I think you can work out how to do the rest. So, when any key is pressed, Cryptic_Store_CombA equals 22. So, let's go to key press. And we go. Oops. Cryptic_Store_CombA equals 22. So, let's try that. I'm going to press a key. You can't see me pressing it, but I'm pressing it. You saw equal 22. I press and release the mouse, it is just 16. I drag it, is going to five. Cool. So, we've done a few of the instructions now. So, what I'm going to do is I'm going to grade back and see how I use so far. So, find the right sketch. There we go. Let's submit the solution. We can see is still not solved. We've got 37.5 percent complete. But we've done some things here. We've still got more. We haven't done anything to Cryptic_Store_CombB. So, there's still a long way to go. Okay. You have to go and see how you get on. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 3.4 Code philosophy: The elegant coder Lesson 3.5: Game project 2: Game character Lesson 3.6: Continuing with Sleuth Video: Video Sleuth case by case: 301 .

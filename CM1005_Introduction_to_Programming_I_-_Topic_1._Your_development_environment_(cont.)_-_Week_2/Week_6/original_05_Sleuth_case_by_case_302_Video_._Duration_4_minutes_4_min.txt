Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key Okay. This is our second case of the topic and the case of the Slippery Minsky Brothers, this is case 302. So, if you download the bank heist sketch form, so standard crime and let's put it up in our, our downloads, say 302, I just extract it and I've open it up in brackets. Okay, so what do we got in here? We've got a sketch and a scene file so, here we've got an image of the gates is bank and we've got a detective and we're going to want to shine the spotlight from the detective all the way to the Minsky Brother. So, if we run this sketch form you'll see that we have a blank screen for the spotlight where we can see some of that image behind it, so, what we need to do if you ever look into sketch is a couple of things, we have to an edit startX to alter the starting position of the spotlight and edit endX to stop the spotlight when it reaches our target, and make the spotlight move perfectly from you towards Sergy by adjusting the increments of x and y, so this is Sergy Minsky in this puzzle, and then when we get everything correctly, done correctly the spotlight should stop over Sergy, okay. So, let's have a look at the scene and what we need to do is set where we want the spotlight to start so that's over our detective, 89,111 is the coordinates so 829 is what we're interested in, where there's just 829, so because we're only worried about the x-coordinates 829 and then the end coordinate is going to be over Sergy Minsky 289,110 so 289 is what we're interested in here, 289 all right. So, initialize x with the start variable is the next thing we have to do, so we got variables here could x and variable could y we don't need to worry about that for now. The x is equal to 829 because that's where we're starting, and we want to alter the variable x like to undermine the spotlight. So if you remember up here it says we can use plus equals or minus equals, so, as we are moving from right to left we're going to want to reduce that value of x, so let say x minus equals one, so that's going to animate one pixel of frame moving that spotlight from start position to the end location. Okay. Let's see that running, let's do that so we can see if we growing from the very beginning, so we're starting our detective and the spotlight is moving across the scene and hopefully it will stop on the Minsky Brother perfect. Okay, so, that is all we have to do here so let's take a look and see how we do for a school, so, let's open up Sleuth again, let me download 302, select sketch, open, and let's submit our solution, perfect. So, we've done that one first time no problems, you'll find in the light levels you will also need to adjust the y-coordinate and when you'll be adjusting the x and the y you just want to use plus or minus one for both of them. You want vary variable values so that it moves and at the correct angle. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 3.4 Code philosophy: The elegant coder Lesson 3.5: Game project 2: Game character Lesson 3.6: Continuing with Sleuth Video: Video Sleuth case by case: 301 .

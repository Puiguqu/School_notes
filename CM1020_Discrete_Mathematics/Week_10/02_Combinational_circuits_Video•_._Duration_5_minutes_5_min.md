Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Combination circuits are networks of logic gates that model Boolean functions. A combination circuit implements a Boolean function given its current configuration of input signals. The goal is to minimize the number of gates used to minimize circuit cost. Boolean functions can be implemented in different ways using combination circuits.

To build a logic network from a Boolean function, label gate outputs as functions of input variables, express Boolean functions for each gate at the first level, and repeat the process until all outputs are written as Boolean expressions. Combinational circuits can be used to design systems for solving specific problems like addition or multiplication.

For example, a half adder can be designed using logic gates to perform binary bit additions. The truth table shows that the sum is represented by the output of the X OR gate, while the carry outputs are represented by the AND gate. To overcome limitations, a full adder with three inputs can be transformed from a half adder.

A full adder's Boolean expression can be represented as x' or y' or carry in, and carry out is expressed as xy plus carry in. These expressions can be designed using a combinational circuit to perform binary bit additions accurately. To simplify complexity, box diagrams are often used to present only inputs and outputs.

This lecture introduced and defined combination circuits, built logic networks from Boolean functions, and showed how they can be used to design systems for solving specific problems.

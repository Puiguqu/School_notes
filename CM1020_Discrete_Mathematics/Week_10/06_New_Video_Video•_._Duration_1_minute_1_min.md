The Studiosity service is an online platform that provides personalized, same-day feedback on written drafts and connects students with specialists for study questions. To access the service, log into the institution's student portal and find the Studiosity link. The service can be used to get feedback on structure, language, spelling, and grammar or to chat with a specialist about study questions. Students can upload their documents before bedtime for same-day feedback the next morning.

Once the document is reviewed by a specialist, students will receive an email and mobile notification with feedback. They can then view the feedback and make changes before submitting the work. The service also offers instant feedback on writing, English skills, math, science, and essential skills. Students can connect with a specialist through the "Connect Now" option.

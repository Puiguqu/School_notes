Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving all key information, formulae, and technical details:

The instructor has made a correction to Question 3(e) regarding tautologies. The revised question states that a tautology is a proposition that is always true. Three propositions, p, q, and r, are introduced. The student is asked to determine whether ((p ∨ q) ∧ (r → s)) ⟺ ((p ∧ r) → s) ∧ ((q ∧ r) → s) is a tautology or not. A truth table can be used to analyze the given proposition. To solve this problem, the student needs to use the laws of propositions or the truth table. The correct solution involves using De Morgan's law and other logical equivalences to simplify the expression. The student should show that the two expressions are logically equivalent. If the two expressions are logically equivalent, then ((p ∨ q) ∧ (r → s)) ⟺ ((p ∧ r) → s) ∧ ((q ∧ r) → s) is a tautology. Otherwise, it is not a tautology. The student can use truth tables or logical equivalences to determine the nature of the proposition. The instructor provides additional resources and guidance for students to complete the problem. The correct answer should be provided in the Mid-Term Assessment [001] activity. The instructor thanks students for taking the time to read the correction and wishes them luck with their coursework.

You may contract your selection using shift + CTRL + arrow key. For screen readers that are incompatible with using arrow keys for shortcuts, you can replace them with the H J K L keys. Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key In this lecture, we will show how Boolean Algebra Theorem or rules can be used to represent and simplify Boolean functions. Then, we will introduce and discuss the Karnaugh map or K-map which is a graphical representation of Boolean functions. As we saw in the lecture in Boolean functions, every function can be written as a sum of products. But this formulation is not necessarily optimal in terms of the number of gates and the depth of the circuit. This is why circuits need to be simplified. Simplification of circuits also called minimisation or optimisation, is beneficial in circuit design for the following reasons. It reduces the global cost of a circuit, by reducing the number of logic gates used. It might reduce the time computation cost of circuits and it allows more circuits to be fitted on the same chip. In this lecture, we will discuss two types of simplifications, algebraic simplification and Karnaugh maps. Algebraic simplification is based on the use of Boolean algebra paradigms to represent and simplify the behavior of Boolean functions. The following theorems or rules can be used for Boolean functions simplifications. De Morgan's laws, distributive laws, the commutative, idempotent and complement laws and the absorption law. Let's consider the Boolean expression E shown here. Using De Morgan's laws and the involution, E can be simplified as shown. Then, using distributive laws E can be further simplified as shown. As we can see, E can be further simplified using commutative idempotent and complement laws. Finally, as the product xz prime is contained in xyz prime, E can be simplified further still by the absorption law as shown here. Let's consider another example using the full adder. As we saw earlier in the lesson on Boolean functions, we can build a sum of products form for the two functions. The sum can be initially expressed as the following sum of products, and then simplify to carry in prime xOx, xOy. The carry out valuable can also initially be expressed as the following sum of products and then simplify to xy plus carry in multiplied by xOy. A Karnaugh or K-map is a graphical representation of Boolean functions and its difference from the two table. It can be used for expressions with 2, 3, 4 or 5 variables. A K-map is shown in an array of cells and cells differing by only one variable are adjacent. The number of cells in a K-map is the total number of possible input variables. For example, the K-map shown here on the left represents the true table on the right. Let's take a look at an example of how Karnaugh maps can help us to simplify Boolean functions. Consider the Boolean function described into two tables shown here. Since we have three variables, we need three input K-map, for which we identify all the 1's first. Then, we group each one value with the maximum possible number of adjacent 1's to form a rectangle, power of 2 long. Then, we write a term for this rectangle. In this case, the minimized expression of f is x plus yz. In this lecture, we showed how Boolean algebra theorems can be used to represent and simplify Boolean functions. Then, we're introduced and discussed the Karnaugh map or K-map which is a graphical representation of Boolean functions. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 5.2 Applications Video: Video Logic gates .

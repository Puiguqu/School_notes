Strong induction is another form of mathematical induction that can be formalized using the following rule of inference: P(k) is true for all k in N, if P(1), P(2), ..., P(k-1) are true, then implies P(k) is true. This means that for all n in N, if P(n) is true for all n ≤ k, then P(k+1) is also true. The well-ordering property states that every nonempty subset of the positive integers has a least element. Mathematical induction can be used to prove statements about natural numbers, and it is equivalent to strong induction and the well-ordering property. A statement P(n) for all n in N where n ≥ 2, n is divisible by a prime number, was proved using strong induction. The basis step involves verifying that 2 is divisible by itself, while the inductive step involves assuming P(k) is true and showing that P(k+1) is also true. The well-ordering property can be used to prove statements about natural numbers by contradiction. Let S be a nonempty set of positive integers with no prime divisor, and assume it has a smallest element n. Then n cannot be prime, so it must have a divisor d between 1 and n, which leads to a contradiction. Therefore, S is empty, verifying the statement P(n). The principles of mathematical induction, strong induction, and well-ordering are all equivalent, meaning that each implies the validity of the other two techniques. This means that proofs using one technique can be adapted for use with another technique if necessary. Strong induction was introduced as an alternative to mathematical induction, but it has a similar structure and proof style. The formal expression of strong induction involves assuming P(1), P(2), ..., P(k-1) are true and showing that P(k+1) is also true. This can be used to prove statements about natural numbers in different ways.

Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key In this lecture, we will introduce three types of proof. We will begin by looking at some definitions and terminology, and that's how to formalize a theorem. Then, we will look at how we can use direct proof, proof by contraposition and proof by contradiction, to prove mathematical statements. A proof is a valid argument that is used to prove the truth of a statement. To build a proof, we need to use all the blocks we have introduced previously. Variables, predicates, quantifiers, laws of logic, and rules of inference. Before moving forward in building proofs, we need to define some terms, even if choosing the appropriate term is intrinsically subjective. A theorem is a formal statement that can be shown to be true. An axiom is a statement we assume to be true to serve as a premise for further arguments. A lemma is a proven statement used as a step to a larger result rather than as a statement for interest by itself. A corollary is a theorem that can be established by a short proof from a theorem. Let's consider the following statement as they exists a real number between any two not equal real numbers. S can be formalized as for all x, y in r, if x is less than y, then there exists z in r where z is between x and y. S is an example of a theorem. The first proof we will discuss is called direct proof. It is based on showing that a conditional statement, p implies q is true. In direct proofs, we start by assuming that p is true and then use axioms, definitions, and theorems together with rules of inference to show that q must also be true. For instance, let's consider a proof of the theorem that we just looked at. That exists a real number between any two not equal real numbers. Let x and y be arbitrary elements in r. Let's suppose x is less than y and let z be the real number, x plus y divided by two. Z is obviously a real number and it's satisfying x is less than z is less than y. Therefore, using the universal generalization rule we can conclude that for all x, y in r if x less than y, then there exists z in r where z is between x and y. Let's have a look to a second type of proof called proof by contrapositive. A proof by contrapositive is based on the fact that proven the conditional statement p implies q is equivalent to proving its contrapositive, not q implies not p. We start by assuming that not q is true, and then use axioms, definitions and theorems together with rules of inference to show that not p must also be true. Let's give a proof of the theorem. If n squared is even, then n is even. First, let's try a direct proof, let n in z. If n squared is even, then there exists k in z where n squared is equal 2k. Then there exists k in z where n is equal plus or minus the square root of 2k. From this equation, it doesn't seem intuitive to prove that n is even. Now, let's try proof by contrapositive. Let's suppose n is odd. Then there exists k in z where n is equal 2k plus 1. Then there exists k in z where n squared is equal 2k plus 1 squared which is equal to 2 multiplied by 2k squared plus 2k plus 1. Which means n squared is also odd. We have succeeded to prove the contrapositive. If n is odd, then n squared is odd. The third type of proof we will examine is called proof by contradiction. It is based on assuming that the statement we want to prove is false and then showing that this assumption leads to a false proposition. We start by assuming that not p is true, and then use axioms, definitions, theorems together with rules of inference to show that not p is false. We then conclude that it was wrong to assume that p is false so it must be true. For instance, let's give a direct proof of the theorem. There are infinitely many prime numbers. Let's suppose there are only finitely many prime numbers. Let's list them as p_1, p_2, p_3, etc. Where p_1 is equal 2, p_2 is equal 3, p_3 is equal 5 and so on. Let's consider the number c equals p_1 multiplying p_2 multiply p_3 and so on until p_n plus 1. The product of all the prime numbers plus 1. Then, as c is a natural number, it has at least one prime divisor. Then, there exists k in the set from one to n where p_k divides c. Then there exists k in the set from one to n. There exists d in n where dp_k is equal c equals p_1 multiplying into p_n plus 1. Then there exists k in one to n and there exists d in n where d is equal p_1 multiplying into p_n plus 1 over p_k. In this expression, one over p_k is an integer which is a contradiction. In this lecture, we introduced three types of proofs. First, we introduced some definitions and terminology and looked at how to formalize a theorem. Then, we showed how we can use direct proof, proof by contraposition, and proof by contradiction to prove mathematical statements. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Video: Video Introduction to proofs .

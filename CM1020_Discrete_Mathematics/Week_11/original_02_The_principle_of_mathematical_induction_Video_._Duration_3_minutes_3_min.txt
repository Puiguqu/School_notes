Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key In this lecture, we will discuss the principle of mathematical induction. First, we will look at the formal definition of mathematical induction and examine the intuition behind it. Then, we will present the structure of induction and conclude by sharing some cases in which it's relevant to use induction. Mathematical induction can be used to assert that the propositional function P of n is true for all positive integers, n. Induction can be formalized using the following rule of inference. P of 1 is true, and for all k, P of k implies P of k plus 1. Therefore, for all n, P of n. Now, let's examine the intuition behind induction. Let P of n be the propositional function verifying P of one is true, and for all k, P of k implies P of k plus 1. Intuitively, we can say the following; P is true for 1, and since p is true for one, it's true for two, and since P is true for two, it's true for three, and so on. Since P is true for n minus 1, it's true for n. In other words, the base case shows that the property initially holds true, and the inductive step shows how each iteration influences the next one. Now, let's look at the structure and the opinion induction. In order to prove that a propositional function, P of n is true for all, we need to verify two steps. First, the basic step, where we show that P of 1 is true. Second, the inductive step, where we show that for all k in n, if P of k is true, which we call the inductive hypothesis, then P of k plus 1 is also true. Mathematical induction can be used to prove P of n is true for all integers greater than a particular integer, where P of n is a propositional function. That might cover multiple cases, such as; proving formulas, proving inequalities, proving divisibility, and proving properties of subsets and their cardinality. We will look at some of these cases in more detail in the next lecture. In this lecture, we discussed the principle of mathematical induction. We begun by introducing a formal definition of mathematical induction and examined the intuition behind it. Then, we looked at the structure of induction and considered some of the ways in which we might use induction. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Video: Video Introduction to proofs .

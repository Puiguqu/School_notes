Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

A recurrence relation defines a sequence based on a rule that gives the next term as a function of previous terms. An infinite sequence is a function from the set of positive integers to the set of real numbers. The Hanoi Tower problem involves transferring n discs from one spoke to another without placing a larger disc on top of a smaller one, with an equation relating the minimum number of moves (an) to n.

A linear recurrence relation has each term as a linear function of earlier terms in the sequence, with two types: homogeneous and non-homogeneous. The Fibonacci sequence is an example of a second-order linear recurrence relation. An arithmetic sequence has a constant difference between consecutive terms, while a geometric sequence has a constant ratio between consecutive terms.

The number of moves required to transfer n discs from one spoke to another can be expressed as the equation an = 2an-1 + 1. A first-order linear recurrence relates the population in N years from now (an+1) to the previous term (an), with initial conditions a0 = 50 million and an+1 = 1.01an + 50,000.

Divide and conquer algorithms solve problems by dividing them into smaller subproblems, solving recursively each subproblem, and combining solutions. The problem of finding the minimum of a sequence can be solved using this approach. Recurrence relations are essential in solving many types of mathematical problems.

In conclusion, recurrence relations are used to define sequences based on rules that give next terms as functions of previous terms. Linear recurrences relate terms by linear functions of earlier terms, while arithmetic and geometric sequences have constant differences or ratios between consecutive terms. Divide and conquer algorithms can be applied to solve many types of mathematical problems.

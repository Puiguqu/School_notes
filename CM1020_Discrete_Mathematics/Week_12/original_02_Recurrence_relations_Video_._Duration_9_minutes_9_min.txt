Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key In this lecture, we will discuss recurrence relations. We will begin by introducing some definitions and by looking at an example of the Hanoi Tower problem. Then we will present linear sequences and explain this concept using a few examples, then we will move on to look at arithmetic and geometric sequences. Finally, we will introduce divide and conquer relations. Recurrence relation is an equation that defines a sequence based on a rule that gives the next term as a function of the previous term. An infinite sequence is a function from the set of positive integers to the set of real numbers. In many cases, it can be very useful to formalize the problem as a sequence before solving it. The game of Hanoi Tower is played with a set of discs of graduated size and a playing board consisting of three spokes for holding the disks. The object of the game is to transfer all the disks from spoke A to spoke C by moving one disk at a time without placing a larger disc on top of a smaller one. Let an be the minimum number of moves required to transfer n discs from one spoke to another. In order to move n discs from A to C, we must move the first n-1 discs from A to B by an-1 moves. Then we must move the last and also the largest disc from A to C by one move. Finally, we must remove the n-1 discs again from B to C by an-1 moves. Therefore the total number of moves is an = 2an-1 + 1. A linear recurrence is a relation in which each term of a sequence is a linear function of earlier terms in the sequence. There are two types of linear recurrence. Linear homogeneous recurrence, these can be formalized as an = C1 an-1 + c2 an-2 + etc until ck an-k. Where c1, c2, ck are elements of R, and k is the degree of the relation. Linear non-homogeneous recurrence, these can be formalized as an = c1 an- 1 + c2 an-2 + until ck an-k + f(n). Where c1, c2, also ck are elements of R, and f(n) is a function depending only on n, and k is the degree of the relation. Now, let's take a look at first order recurrence by considering the following case. Let's imagine a country with a current population of 50 million people. It has a population growth rate, which is birth rate minus death rate of 1% per year. It received 50,000 immigrants per year. Now, let's try to find this country's population in 10 years from now. This case can be modeled as the following first-order linear recurrence. Where an is the population in n years from now. And for N in N, an + 1 is expressed as an +1 = 1.01 an + 50,000, and a0 = 50 million. Now, let's look at second order recurrence by considering the following sequence. 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, etc., where each number is found by adding up to two numbers before it. This sequence can be modeled as the following second-order linear recurrence, an = an-1 + an-2, a0 = 0, and a1 = 1. This sequence is famously known as the Fibonacci sequence. Sequence is called arithmetic if the difference between consecutive terms is a constant c. For all n, an + 1 is expressed as an + 1 = an + c, and an = a. For example, the sequence 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, is arithmetic with an initial term of a0 = 2, and a common difference of 3. Also the sequence 30, 25, 20, 15 is arithmetic with an initial term of a0 = 30, and a common difference of -5. A sequence is called geometric if the ratio between consecutive terms is a constant r. For n in n, an + 1 is expressed as an + 1 = r multiplied by an and a0 = a. For instance, the sequence 3, 6, 12, 24, 48 is geometric with an initial term of a0 = 3, and a common ratio of 2. Also the sequence 125, 25, 5, 1, 1 over 5, 1 over 25 is geometric with an initial term of a0 = 125, and a common ratio of 1 over 5. Let's move on to look at divide and conquer algorithms. This kind of algorithm consists of three steps. Dividing the problem into smaller subproblems, solving recursively each subproblem, and then combined solutions to find a solution to the original problem. Let's consider the problem of finding the minimum of a sequence an where n is an element of n. If n = 1, the number is itself minimum or maximum. If n is greater than 1, begin by dividing the numbers into two lists. Then order the sequence, then find the min and max in the first lists, then find the min and max in the second list. Finally, we can infer the min and max of the entire list. In this lecture, we discussed recurrence relations. First, we introduce some definitions and looked at an example of the Hanoi Tower problem. Then we examined linear sequences and considered some examples. We did the same for arithmetic and geometric sequences. Finally, we introduced divide and conquer relations. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 6.2 Recursion Video: Video Recursive definitions .

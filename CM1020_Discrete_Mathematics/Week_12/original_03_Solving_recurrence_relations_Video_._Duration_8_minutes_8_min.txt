First, we will solve an example of a linear recurrence, then we will explore the special case of solving Fibonacci recurrence. Finally, we will see how strong induction can be used to solve recurrence relations. Let's begin by looking at how to solve linear recurrence. Let a_n equals c_1 a_n minus 1 plus c_2 a_n minus 2 plus so on until c_k a_n minus k be a linear homogeneous recurrence. If a combination of the geometric sequence a_n equals r^n is a solution to this recurrence, it satisfies r^n equals c_1 r^n minus 1 plus c_2 r^n minus 2, etc, and to c_k r^n minus k. By dividing both sides by r^n minus k, we get r^k equals c_1 r^k minus 1 plus c_2 r^k minus 2. C_k, this equation is called the characteristic equation. Solving this equation is the first step towards finding a solution to linear homogeneous recurrence. If r is a solution of the equation with multiplicity p, then the combination Alpha plus Beta n plus Gamma n squared plus etc, Mu n^p minus 1, multiplied by r^n satisfies the recurrence. We will examine some examples of how this works in the next section. Now, let's look at how we can solve the Fibonacci recurrence relation. F_n equals f_n minus 1 plus f_n minus 2 with f_0 equals 0 and f_1 equals 1. The characteristic equation of Fibonacci recurrence relation is r squared minus r minus 1 equals 0. It has two distinct roots of multiplicity 1; r_1 equals 1 plus square root of 5 divided by 2 and r_2 equals 1 minus square root of 5 divided by 2. F_n equals Alpha_1 r_1^n plus Alpha_2 r_2^n is a solution. To find Alpha_1 and Alpha_2 we need to use the initial conditions. Let's begin with the following two equations. F_0 equals Alpha_1 plus Alpha_2 equals 0 and f_1 equals Alpha_1 multiplied by 1 plus root square of 5 divided by 2 plus Alpha_2 multiplied by 1 minus root square of 5 divided by 2 equals 1. By solving those two equations we can find Alpha_1 equals 1/ root square of 5 and Alpha_2 equals minus 1/ root square of 5. The solution can then be formalized as follows. Now, let's consider another sequence. A_n equals minus 3 a_n minus 1 minus 3 a_n minus 2 minus a_n minus 3. Where a_0 equals 1 a_1 equals minus 2 and a_2 equals minus 1. The characteristic equation of this relation is r^3 plus 3r^2 plus 3r plus 1 equals 0. It has one distinct root whose multiplicity is 3r_1 equals minus 1. A_n equals Alpha_0 plus Alpha_1n plus Alpha_2 n^2 multiplied by r_1^n is a solution. To find Alpha_0, Alpha_1, and Alpha_2 we need to use the initial conditions. We begin by the following a_0 equals Alpha_0 equals 1, a_1 equals minus Alpha_0 plus Alpha_1 plus Alpha_2 equals minus 2. A_2 equals Alpha_0 plus 2Alpha_1 plus 4Alpha_2 equals minus 1. From this we can find Alpha_1 equals 3, Alpha_2 equals minus 2 and the solution can then be formalized as follows. Sometimes it's easier to verify a recurrence relation solution using strong induction. For example let's try to prove the following, P of n the sequence f_n equals 1/ root square of 5 multiplied by r_1^n minus r_2^n satisfies the Fibonacci recurrence, where r_1 and r_2 are the roots of r squared minus r minus 1 equals 0. Now, let's check for P of 2. F_1 plus f_0 equals 1 equals f_2. We know this because f_2 equals 1/ root square of 5 multiplied by r_1 squared minus r_2 squared equals 1. This verifies the initial condition. Now, let k in n where P of 2, P of 3 until P of k are all true. Let's verify P of k plus 1. F_n plus f_n minus 1 can be simplified as follows, which is equal to f_n plus 1. We can conclude from this that P of k plus 1 is true and the strong induction is therefore verified. In this lecture, we looked at how we can solve recurrence relations. We began by solving an example of a linear recurrence, then we presented a special case of solving Fibonacci recurrence. Finally, we showed how strong induction can be used to solve recurrence relations. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 6.2 Recursion Video: Video Recursive definitions .

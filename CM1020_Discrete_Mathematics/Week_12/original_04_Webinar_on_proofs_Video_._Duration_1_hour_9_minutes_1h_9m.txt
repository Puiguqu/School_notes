Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key As I said today, we will just review the proofs that we have done before, and we'll just go through some examples of each one of the proofs that we've done. We will have a look at direct proof, proof by contra-position, proof by contradiction, and proof by induction, and we will also visit the strong induction proof. What is a proof? A proof is a valid argument that is used to prove that a statement is true. To build a proof, we have to use all that we have seen previously. We can use variables, predicates, quantifiers, all the laws of logic, rules of inference that we have done. All those tools that we have seen before, we can use them to give a valid proof to a statement. The first proof that we've looked at is called a direct proof. Sorry, I'm just checking the messages if there is any problem. A direct proof is to prove that if P is true, if a proposition of a statement is true, does this imply that Q is true? Really it's to prove that the conditional statement P implies Q is true. That is what we call direct proof. We start by assuming that this P is true, and we try to show that if this is the case, P is true, then Q also must be true. And that's what we call a direct proof. We start from something that is true and we tried to show the second thing must be always true. Well, let's try to prove this statement here. There exists a real number between any two, not equal real numbers. So if you take any real number X and Y, we must show that there exists a real number between them. We need to show this and we can use that direct proof to show this. To prove this you take two X and Y, which are real numbers, and that's your proposition P or your statement P. We assume that X and Y are two real numbers, and because they are two real numbers, one of them will be different, they are not equal. X can be less than Y, or Y can be less than X. We take the option where X is less than Y. If X is less than Y, let's make Z another real number that is equal to x plus y over two. Clearly, Z is also a real number, and Z is less than Y, and it's greater than X and it's between two of them. We take two real numbers, X and Y, we assume that X is less than Y and we show that we can find a real number Z, that is between them. This is a direct proof. Yeah, that's fine. Great. , once you have that, therefore, you can use the universal generalization rule and you can say that for all x, y in r, If x is less than y, then there exists z in r such that z is in between those two. We used a direct proof to prove that if you take any two real numbers X, Y, then you can find another real number between them. That proves this statement here, there exists a real number between any two, not equal numbers. Sorry, I was just checking if everything is going well with the technology. Well, remember, we said p implies q logic is equivalent to, not q implies not p. So those two statements are equivalent. They are the same. If we want to prove this is the contrapositive of p implies q. Those two statements say the same thing. They are equivalent. They are two at the same time, they are fours at the same time. If we want to prove p implies q, we start from p true and will try to prove that q is true as well. That's a direct proof, sometime is not straightforward to the direct proof. What do you want to do is to prove by contraposition. What you do is you try to prove this statement which is equivalent to this. If you're trying to prove that if not q is true, then not p is true, and this is called the proof by contradiction. If we want to prove that p implies q, we start by assuming that not q is true. We try to prove that not p is also true. That's what we're trying to prove in prove by contrapositive. Let's look at this statement that we've done before. We want to prove that if n squared is even, n is an integer, if n squared is even, then n must be even. That's what we want to prove? Suppose we want to use a direct proof for the statement, assume we want to use direct proof. If we wouldn't use direct proof, we say, let's n be an integer, which is element of z. Assume that n squared is even, n squared is even means there exist k element in z such that m square is equal to 2k. That's just the definition of even numbers. This leads that there exist k such that n is equal to the square root plus/minus square root of 2k. From this equation, it doesn't seem intuitive to prove that n is even, it doesn't tell us anything about n is even. Using direct proof here, starting from n squared is even and trying to prove that n is even, it's a bit tricky. As you can see, we can't tell from this that n is an even number. But what we can do is prove this by contrapositive. What is the contrapositive of n squared even implies n even? It's contrapositive is n odd, which is not even, implies n squared odd. Instead of proving n square is even, implies n is even, we will try to prove not key, which is n is odd, implies n squared is odd. We try to prove it's contrapositive. Because this is the contrapositive of this, and that's what we going to prove now. This is the direct proof we say it doesn't work. Let's now start by n is odd. We start by not key. What does it mean n it's odd? N it's odd means that there exist k, element of z, which is an integer, such that n is equal to 2k plus 1. If n is equal to 2k plus 1, means that n squared is equal to 2k plus 1 squared, which is equal to 4k squared plus 4k plus 1, which is equal to 2 times 2k squared plus 2 plus this 1 here. Then this is odd number because it's 2 times something plus 1, which is an odd number. What we've done, we went from n is odd, and we showed that n squared is odd as well. Then n squared is odd. Therefore, you can say now that this is proved by contraposition, and you can say that if n squared is even, then n is even as well. Because we proved that if n is odd, then n squared is odd. It's contrapositive means if n squared is even, then n is even as well. As I say, using direct proof is tricky. You can see that starting from n squared is an even number, we can't really show that n is an even number, but we can do it by contrapositive. Why the first is seen as not unintuitive? It depends. You now why? We count from here, say that n is 2 times another number. But from here, if we start from n odd, then we can actually find that n square is also an odd number. That's just an example where proving by contrapositive or contraposition is easier and straightforward than using a direct proof. The other proof that we've looked at, is we looked at proof by contradiction. We trying to prove that a statement is true. What we do in prove by contradiction, we assume that what we're trying to prove is false, and by assuming this will lead us to a contradiction. We'll look at one example and see what proof by contradiction means. We trying to prove that p is true. What we do, we assume that not p is true, and try to find a contradiction that shows that not p is false because that's what we're trying to show. By one example, let's look at this example. We're trying to prove that there is no greatest even integer. Means there is no integer that is the greatest integer. Means there is no other integer greatest than N. We trying to prove this, but how are we going to prove it? We prove that there is actually an N. We assume the opposite. This is p. Sorry I'll have to do this. P, there is no greatest integer. That is P. What is naught P? There exists one greatest integer, we assume there exists. Now we start by naught P is true, means there exists an integer, greatest integer N, we call it N. This is the highest integer ever, there is no other integer greater than it. Let's say there exists this integer. Let's now take another integer M. Let M be just N plus two. Sorry, there is no greatest even integer. So greatest even integer in here. Let's now assume that there exists this N which is greatest and it's an even. Let M be another integer which is just N plus two. Clearly, this M is also even. M is greater than N, this is a contradiction. A contradiction because we said that N is the greatest. There is no more even integer greater than it. We start that this is the greatest even integer, we come up and found out there is actually another even integer that is greater than N so this is a contradiction. Let's suppose there is a greatest even integer N. Let M be another integer and with M is equal to just N plus two. Sometimes it's obvious, unless it says it. So far I'm not using any theorem here, I'm just using the things that I really know. Clearly M here is equal to N plus two. M is also an even number because the sum of two even numbers is an even number. N is even, 2 is even, N plus 2 is even therefore M is even number. Also, M is equal to N plus 2, so M is greater than N. This is a contradiction because our assumption where we start from, our initial condition, we say that N is the greatest even number. We actually found that there exist another even number that is greater than N, which is a contradiction and this adds the proof. Once you do this, therefore, you can say there is no greatest even integer. That's an example of proving things by contradiction. You want to prove that statement P is true, you assume that naught P is true and try to find a contradiction that contradicts that naught P is true and that's what we've done. We assume that there exists an even integer which is the greatest and we found that there exists another one which is greater than N, which is M in this case. Therefore, this N cannot be the greatest even integer. That is proved by a contradiction. We are trying to prove P. We start by naught P is true. If you find a contradiction to naught P is true, then this will [inaudible] the proof and we say that P that we're trying to prove is actually true. Have you got any questions about proof by contradiction before I can move to proof by induction? Okay, Claire. Thank you. is we will move to prove by induction, that most of you asked me last week to a webinar about it, but I thought I mentioned other ways of proving things. First, let's look at mathematical induction can be used to asset that the propositional function p_n is true for all integer n, for example. We want to prove that some sequence or the term of a sequence satisfy some formula. We want to show that this function P proposition that take as argument n satisfies some formula for all n, for p1, p2, p3, p4, and so on. That's what we're trying to prove are the sequence of things. The rule of inference is used here. To understand the idea behind the induction, what you're trying to do there is a few steps. First, you look at the first element, which is p1. For n is equal to 1, one is the first element of n, first value of n. You look at p1 and check if it's true because you want to show that p1 is true, p2 is true,p_n and for all values of n are greater than 1. First, you look at p1 and the first one, say, "Is this true?" If it's not true you stop there, what you're trying to prove is wrong. First thing to do is we try that. thing is, we're trying to prove this statement here. For all k, we're trying to prove if p_k is true, then p_k plus 1 must be true. If we have p1 is true, and we have that for all k, if p_k is true then p_k plus 1 is true. If this then we can deduce that for all n, p_n is true. If we have this as our hypothesis, then this leads to this conclusion. I'll show you what does this mean? We can look at here, the intuition behind the induction. If we have p1 is true and we have for all k, p_k implies p_k plus 1 means whenever p_k is true, then p_k plus 1 is true. Then intuitively, we checked this p1 is true and if we have this, if p1 is true, if we replace k by one here, that means p1 plus 1 is true, that means p2 is true. Since p1 is true for one, then it's true for two. Again, p2 is true, then if we replace k here by two and here, so k by two then here will be three. So if p2 is true then p3 is true and so on. Then you can get if p_n minus 1 is true, then p is also true for n and that's what? Intuition of the induction. If those two things are true, this p1 is true and this p_k, this conditional is true means whenever p_k is true then p_k plus 1 is true, then we can deduce that p_n is true for any value of n greater or equal to 1. What I was trying to show you, I think in the videos we showed how those two steps are one and we called them inductive step. p_k is true implies p_k plus 1 is true. We start from p_k is true and we show that p_k plus 1 is true. I separate one step in two steps. First one, what we do in induction, this is the steps that we need to follow to prove anything by induction. First is the base case. The base case is we show that what you are trying to prove is true for n is equal to 1 or for the first term of your sequence. The next thing that you can do is you assume that P of k is true for some value k. A last step that you need to show, this is where the work starts actually. Here, you just show it for n is equal to 1, here you just assume that what you're trying to prove is true for n is equal to k. It's just an assumption, we call it Induction hypothesis. Here you throw it by assuming that P of k is true. In the induction step, we show that P of k plus 1 is always true. By assuming, if you remember here, P of k plus 1, P of k implies P of k plus 1. This is our induction hypothesis and this is our induction step, so we separate this into two steps, instead of assuming P of k is true, imply that I separate this I say, let's assume this is true. We call it Induction hypothesis, and let's show that P of k plus 1 is true. This is called the induction step. There are the three steps that we need to follow to prove anything that can be proved by induction. What I will do now, I will go through about three examples and we can still apply those three steps to prove that the statement is true by induction. I've already done this, that is fine. We're trying to prove that, let Sn be a sum of the first n positive integers. Sn will be 1 plus 2 plus 3, so on till n. I want to prove by induction that this sum, 1 to n, 1 plus 2 plus 3 till n is equal to n times n plus 1 over 2. I want to prove this by induction. Yes, it is recorded. I want to prove this by induction. First thing I need to do is to look at the base case. What do I do in the base case? I check if it is true for n is equal to 1, base case. The base case, or we call it the basis step, S1 is equal to 1. What is Sn? We keep adding till we get to n. S1, you just have 1, so S1 is equal to 1. So S1 is equal to 1, and it satisfies the formula if you replace n by 1, so it's 1 times 1 plus 1 over 2, so this is 1 times 2 over 2, which is equal to 1. We looked at the value of S1, which is 1, satisfies the formula. What we've done here, we went to this formula here. We substitute n by 1, 1 times 1 plus 1 over 2 and see if what we get is exactly the same value as S1. That is all what we have done in the base case. We go to the formula, we substitute n by 1, see what you get is exactly the same value as the S1. We saw, we just checked it is true, so the base case is true. Now, the Induction hypothesis, what we do and we assume, this is an assumption, you don't prove it, it is an assumption. You assume that for n is equal to k, Sk satisfies what you're trying to prove. All you have to do again, substitute n by k here. S of k is equal to k times k plus 1 over 2. That's your Induction hypothesis, you assume that this is true. That's all you have to do, and you get a mark for it, if you have a proven answer. You get a mark by replacing this n by 1 and showing that the base case is true. You get a mark by just assuming, that it's true for n is equal to k and substitute n by k. , this is where the work starts. Now, induction step is now we need to show that it's also true for n is equal to k plus 1. You remember we said S(k) has to imply S(k) plus 1. This is our S(k). We assume that S(k) is true. Now we're trying to show that also S(k) plus 1 is true. What does it mean? Go to the formula, replace n by k plus 1. We're trying to prove that S(k) plus 1 is replace n by k plus 1 here, which is k plus 1 times k plus 1 plus two, one. So all what we have done here, I take you back to the formula. I'm replacing n by k plus 1. k plus 1 here. This is k plus 1, k plus 1, plus one, divided by two. I'm trying to prove that S(k) plus 1 is equal to k plus 1 times k plus 1 plus one, over two, which is just k plus 1 times k plus two, over two. That's what we're trying to prove now. First think that this is not an assumption like this. We assume this is two. Now we are trying to prove this. We're trying to prove that this formula holds for n is equal k plus 1 as well. We go back to the definition. What is S(k) plus 1? 1S(k) plus 1 is one plus two plus three, till k. Then you add one more value, which is k plus 1. This is what S(k) plus 1 is. One plus two, till you get to k plus 1, which is the sum of the first k plus 1 positive integer. So by definition, that's how the function S of n is defined. What is this? One plus two plus three plus, till k, this is just S(k). I can substitute this sum here all by S(k). I have S(k), plus k plus 1. If you look at S(k),my induction hypothesis, I assume that the S(k) is equal to k times k plus 1, over two. Therefore, I can substitute now this S(k) by this expression here. Because I assumed my induction hypothesis, I assumed that S(k) is equal to k times k plus 1 divided by two, so I can substitute it. I substitute now this S(k) by k times k plus 1 divided by two. This is the induction hypothesis allows me to do the substitution because I repeat, I assume that this is true, then I can use it here. thing, all I have to do is do the same denominator and do some simplification, and I'll get to k plus 1 times k plus 2 over two. Yeah. I start from the definition of S(k) plus 1, used the my induction hypothesis, substitute S(k) by this expression, do some simplification, and I got to exactly what I want to prove. I wanted to prove this and I showed it here. Once you do that, you should know that if it's true for S(k), then it must be true for S(k) plus 1 as well. Once you do that, you can say, hence the formula holds for S(k) plus 1. As a conclusion, when you do those three steps, you can say that for all n greater or equal to one, Sn is equal to n times n plus one divided by two. Is this okay so far, or I move to another example? I've got a few examples. Did you understand these steps here? Fantastic. Excellent. We can move to another example then. Let's look at this example now. We've got this sequence. You have done sequences. You know what a sequence. Sequence can be defined either by a sequence of numbers, or it can be defined by giving the first value of a sequence you want, and give a recursive relation that links two consecutive terms. So this the nth plus 1 term is just the nth term plus n, for all n greater or equal to one. We try to prove that this. We try to prove by induction that the terms of this sequence U_n, the nth term it satisfies this formula as well. N times n minus 1 over 2, and we try to prove it for all n greater or equal to 1. We try to do this by induction. First thing to do, you go to the base case. What we do in a base case, we're trying to show that it's true for n is equal to 1. So for n is equal to 1, U_1 is given to us as 0, which is equal to 1 times 1 minus 1 over 2. Or we substitute n by 1, which gave us 0 as well. Then it's true. Yes we will do one example on strong induction. That is true, that n's the base case here. is our induction hypothesis, what we do, we assume what we are trying to prove is true for n is equal to k. N is equal to k, so it means we assume that the kth term is also satisfies this formula, which is k times k minus 1 over 2. That's our induction hypothesis. is our induction step. What do we want to show? Can you see that I put them in red. We show it for n is equal to 1, that's our base case. Here I put assume, we don't show we just assume, we suppose for n is equal to k is true. That's all what we do, and here in the induction step, I put show as well, again, in red. We show that it's true for n is equal to k plus 1. That's what we do. So now let's try to show that U_k plus 1 is also equal to, satisfies the formula, means replace n by k plus 1. That will be k plus 1 times k plus 1 minus 1 over 2. I'm trying to show that U_k plus 1, we simplifying this 1 minus 1, I'm trying to show that U_k plus 1 is equal to k plus 1 times k over 2. That's what we're trying to show now. I'll go back to the definition and find the relation that links U_k plus 1 to U_k, the k plus 1 term to the kth term. The relation was n plus 1 is U_n plus n. I replace now, n by k plus 1, n plus 1 here, I substitute k plus 1 here, then here will be k, then here plus k. This is the definition. This is how the sequence was defined to us. Then we use that definition, then what is U_k? Again, U_k is this term here, is my induction hypothesis. My induction hypothesis says that this term U_k is equal to k times k minus 1 divide by 2. What I can do now is I can substitute this U_k by this term here, because the induction hypothesis allows me to do that. is I just do the same denominator, that's induction hypothesis, and I just do some simplification and I'll get exactly what I want. Which is k times k plus 1 divide by 2, which is exactly what I want to prove. I start from the definition, I use my induction hypothesis, I do some simplification to get to what I'm trying to prove. Once you do that, you just say, therefore, for all n, U_n is equal to n times n minus 1 over 2 for all n greater or equal to 1. This is hence, the proof again. We got two examples that we've done so far. I think I've got three for you. We can do this example, then we move to another example on strong induction. If you understand the induction, strong induction is pretty easy as well. But this is the basics, is to understand the three steps that you need to do. Let's have another sequence defined as follows: the first term is u_1 is 1 and u_n is equal to u _n minus 1 plus 2 times n minus 1. We are trying to prove that all terms of this sequence u_n is equal to n squared, for all n greater or equal to 1. Another example, let's do that. First, we go to the base case. We show that this is true for n is equal to 1. So u_1 is given to us as equal to1, which is 1 is equal to 1 squared, then this is true. That's all you have to do in your base case. Induction hypothesis again, assume that for n is equal to k plus 1, we have u_k is equal to k squared. I assume that what I'm trying to prove is true for k_10. That's all I have done. That is true. That's my assumption that I can use later. Now in my induction step, remember, again, I show that for n is equal to k plus 1, u_k plus 1, which is the k plus 110, also is equal to just to k plus 1 squared. Now we need to show it. Got a question-mark. We don't assume here, we show. First, I go back to the definition. By definition, u_k plus 1 is equal to u_k plus 2 times k plus 1 minus 1. Can you all see this by definition? All I've done is I went to the formula and replaced n by k whenever I found n, or n by k plus 1 because we have n minus 1. You just go to the formula and try to find the relation that links k plus 110 to k_10, that's by definition. I look again, what is this u_k? It is my induction hypothesis. What does my induction hypothesis? My induction hypothesis says that u_k is equal to k squared. Induction hypothesis allows me to substitute this u_k by k squared. is, what is k squared plus 2k plus 1, because this 2 minus 1 will be just 1. So we will have k squared plus 2k plus 1, which is just, if you want to factorize this, it will just give you k plus 1 squared. That's exactly what I'm trying to prove. Trying to prove that u_k plus 1 is equal to k plus 1 squared. I start by the definition of the k plus 110. The relation that links k plus 110 to its previous term, which is k_10 in this case. I use my induction hypothesis to substitute u_k by k squared. Then I come here to do some simplification and I get to exactly what I want to prove. Therefore I say that, for all n greater or equal to 1, the nth term is equal to n squared. Is the induction clearly now? Do you all understand it? Well, I put three examples. Hopefully, you can see the pattern, how we prove something by induction. What we've looked at today, we looked at direct proof. We looked at proof by contradiction, and we looked at proof by contra-position, and we looked at how we can prove a statement as well by induction. Which if you understand the induction, strong induction is pretty easier as well. Sometime it is easy to prove statements using different form of mathematical induction called strong induction. I will show you one case. Strong induction can be formalized using the following rules of inference. This is what we need in strong induction that's exactly the same. If you looked at what we've done before for simple induction that we've looked at before, we didn't say for all k. That is our base case is true. We didn't say for all k. We didn't say P1 is true, P2 is true, and Pk is true, all this must apply to Pk plus 1 is true. What we've said, we've said P1 is true and we've said if Pk is true, then Pk plus 1 must be true. That's what we said. We didn't say, but in strong induction, you assume for all end up to k, for n is equal to 1, 2, 3, 4 until k, all true. From that your assumption, that will be your induction hypothesis, you tried to show that Pk plus 1. Because sometimes you might have a recursive relation that links three consecutive [inaudible] three, Un to Un plus 1. Yes, that's an n. Yes. I'll show it here. I'll probably put it here for you. What we did in simple induction, in induction that we've seen so far, we said, we prove P1, that's our base case and we say for all k, and we say we need to prove Pk leads to Pk plus 1. That's what we've done. If we do that, we can generalize that for all n greater or equal to 1, Pn is true. This will lead us to this conclusion. We only assume that P of k is true and show that P of k plus 1 is true. That's what we know. But in strong induction, we do P of 1 is true, and now inductive step, we say for all k and element of n, we say P of 1, and P of 2, and P of 3 and P of k, this must all be true. This will take you to P of k plus 1. You have to assume that it's true for all the elements up to k and show that it's also true for k plus 1. It's very similar. We have to show the last year induction base case. Then this will be your induction hypothesis. You show that it's true for P1, P2, P3, until Pk. You assume that it's not just true for Pk, it's true for all numbers less than k. Then you show in the induction step, then it's true for k plus 1 as well. Sometime what happens is, you might have a sequence U_n plus 1 is equal to, let's say, U_n plus 2 U_n minus 1 plus 3 U_n minus 3. You have, how many terms here? U_n plus 1 U 2, U_n minus 1, U_n minus 2, here. You have three consecutive, 1, 2, 3, 4 term in a sequence. You're trying to show that some formula is true for all of them. Your base case here, you have to show it for U_1, U_2, U3, and U_4. Your induction hypothesis will be, assume that U_1, U_2 till U_k is true. All of them assume that what you're trying to prove is true for U_1, U_2. Not just for U_k as we've done before, for all of them, for any value less than k. Then, your induction step will be show that it's true for k plus 1. It's similar, you don't say P of k implies P of k plus 1 but what you say is P of 1 and P of 2, and, and, and, P of k, will imply P of k plus 1. We will look at one example and hopefully we'll clarify this. Let's start by proving a simple statement expressed as propositional function. We have this propositional function P of n, which says that for all element of n, and n greater than 2, n is divisible by a prime number. What we're trying to prove? What you need to do, you want to have, I think, strong induction and the induction [inaudible] only on the induction hypothesis. If you use strong induction in where you can use just the induction, it's true as well. If you assume that for all n less than k, P of k is true, implies P of k plus 1 is true, is also you can say that in the induction. In some cases, like this case that we will be looking at, you assuming just P of k is true is not enough to show that P of k plus 1 is true. Sometimes, as we've seen in those examples that we've looked at, just the assumption that P of k is true is enough to show that P of k plus 1 is true. But in some cases, it's not enough; that's where we need the strong induction. Does that make sense to you? Let's try to prove this statement. P of n, which means that for any integer n greater or equal to 2, n must be divisible by a prime number. We need to prove this using strong induction. Base case, you look at P of 2, the first one. P of 2 reduces to 2, the first number, which is 2. Two is divisible by itself, it's divisible by prime number as 2 is a prime number, so it's true for 2, for the first one. Your induction hypothesis is now, assume that for k, which is greater than 2, k is an integer greater than 2, assume that P of 2, P of 3 is all true. Assume that 2 is divisible by a prime number. one, 3 is divisible by prime number, 4 is divisible by prime number, five to k. That's what we are as our assumption. Now, we assume that any number between 2 and k is divisible by a prime number. What does this means? It means if you take any number m, between 2 and k, where 2 and k are included, there exists p, which is a prime number dividing m. It means m is divisible by a prime number and this prime number, we'll call it p. So that is what our induction. Our induction hypothesis now says that any number between 2 and k, then this number must be divisible by a prime number called p. There exist one prime. We call it p that divides m. This is true for all m between 2 and k, not just for k as we've done before for all the numbers between 2 and k. That's our induction hypothesis. Now what we're trying to do now, in induction step, we need to show that P of k plus 1 is also true. What does this mean? We need to show that there exists a p, a prime number that divides k plus 1 as well. :06 We assume that all the numbers from 2 to k, we can find a prime number dividing them. Now, by using the assumption, we need to show that k plus 1 also is divisible by a prime number, or there exist a prime number that divides k plus 1. That's what we need to show. There are two cases. K plus 1 can either be prime number or can either be not prime. Assume that k plus 1 is a prime number. If it's a prime number, it divide itself then it's true. If it's a prime number, every number divides itself. For prime number then it's divisible by itself. :15 K plus 1 is not a prime number. If k plus 1 is not a prime number, what does it mean? Means there exist m dividing k plus 1. This m must be between 2 and k. If k plus 1 is not prime, means there exists an integer m, which divides k plus 1 and m is between 2 and k. :08 What we said in our induction hypothesis, we said that for all m between 2 and k, there exists p, a prime number that's dividing m. If m divides k plus 1, and the prime number p divides m, this means that p also divides k plus 1, which verifies that P of k plus 1 is also true. :44 So if we assume, that's why we need strong induction here. Because once we say m is not a prime number, means there exist m between 2 and k plus 1 is not just k yeah? It can be any number between 2 and k plus 1. So we need to assume in our assumption, assume that. :28 Yes that is correct Joshua. That is correct. Yeah. :46 It doesn't really matter in multiple cases. If assuming that p of k is not enough, that you might need all the previous term to satisfy the formula first before you can move to k plus 1 then strong induction can work in this case. :14 slide. :18 Which slide Tama? This one, yes. :46 Now, the question was showing that any number that is greater or equal to 2. So our starting point is 2, if we worked for any number. :13 That's what you're showing there they're all prime numbers and prime number divides itself. :24 The definition of a prime number is divisible by one and itself. So we still satisfied because what we were trying to show, if a number is greater than or equal to 2, then it's divisible by a prime number, okay? So that's why we went through those cases here. So case 1, if it's a prime number, is divisible by itself, it's satisfy what you trying to prove, case 2 is not a prime number, then there must exist an m between 2 and k, which divides k plus 1. We use our induction hypothesis here, it allows us to say that there exist p prime number dividing m, and therefore p divides k plus 1 as well as p divides m and m divides k plus 1, therefore p divides k plus 1. By doing this, we showed that what we're trying to prove is true for k plus 1 as well. Therefore, what we are trying to prove is true. :35 Just to give you a summary of what we've looked today. We've looked at different ways of proving that a statement is true. First thing we looked, we looked at direct proof, we looked at p implies p. Second things we looked at, we looked at prove by contraposition. Well maybe that proof will work. We did an example with direct proof really can't give us much. Then, let's prove its contrapositive statement. When we prove not q implies not p. Then we did another hypothesis could prove by contradiction. We try to prove that statement p is true. You assume that actually not p is true means you assume that p is false and if that leads you to contradiction then that's how we would prove by contradiction. Then last two that we've looked at, we've looked at proof by induction, we went through a few examples, about three examples of induction. Then we went through this example here, which shows when to use a strong induction. I think that's all I want to tell you about today. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 6.2 Recursion Lesson 6.3 Extra resources Video: Video Webinar on proofs .

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving all key information, formulae, and technical details:

A walk in a graph is a sequence of vertices and edges where vertices and edges can be repeated. A walk of length k in a graph is a succession of k edges that are not necessarily different. A trail is a walk in which no edge is repeated, while a circuit is a closed trail with repeated vertices only.

A path is a trail in which neither vertices nor edges are repeated, and the length of a path is equal to the number of edges it contains. A cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex. An Eulerian path visits each edge of a graph exactly once, while a Hamiltonian path visits each vertex of a graph exactly once.

A strongly connected digraph has a directed path between all pairs of vertices, while a connected undirected graph has a path connecting any two nodes. The transitive closure of a digraph G is the digraph G* that contains a directed edge from U to V if there exists a directed path from U to V in G.

A simple graph has no multiple edges between any pair of vertices, an r-regular graph has exactly r edges incident on each vertex, and a complete graph has an edge between every pair of vertices. The degree sequence of a graph is the sequence of degrees of its vertices. Understanding these concepts is essential for studying graph theory and its applications in computer science and other fields.

A digraph can be classified into different types based on its connectivity properties, such as strongly connected or weakly connected graphs. The transitive closure provides reachability information about a digraph, allowing us to determine whether there exists a directed path between two vertices.

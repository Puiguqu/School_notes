# Special graphs: simple, r-regular and complete graphs Videoâ€¢ . Duration: 13 minutes 13 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/vfFhv/special-graphs-simple-r-regular-and-complete-graphs)

This is not a problem to be solved, but rather a transcript of a video lesson on graph theory. It appears to be a collection of lectures and practice assignments for a course on graph theory.

If you'd like, I can help you summarize the main points or topics covered in the transcript, but there isn't a specific problem to be solved. Let me know if you have any further questions!

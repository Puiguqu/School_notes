Graph theory is a fundamental area of discrete mathematics with applications in computer science, biology, sociology, and many other fields. A walk in a graph is an alternating sequence of vertices and edges, starting and ending with a vertex, where vertices and edges can be repeated. A walk can be represented as: v0, e1, v1, e2, ..., ek, vk where vi = (vi−1, vi) for i = 1, 2, ..., k. Examples of walks include sequences that start and end at a vertex, passing through another vertex, such as (a, b), b, (b, d), d, (d, a), a. A walk can also be a sequence that starts and ends at the same vertex, visiting each edge exactly once, such as (a, b), b, (b, d), d, (d, a), a. A path is a walk in which all vertices and edges are distinct. Formally, a path from vertex u to vertex v can be represented as: u = v0, e1, v1, e2, ..., ek, vk = v where vi ≠ vj for all i ≠ j. This ensures that a path does not revisit any vertex. An example of a path from a to d is: a, (a, b), b, (b, d), d. A circuit is a walk that starts and ends at the same vertex, with all edges distinct. Formally, a circuit can be represented as: v0, e1, v1, e2, ..., ek, vk = v0 where vi ≠ vj for all i ≠ j except vi = vk. Understanding walks, paths, and circuits is essential in various applications, including Network Routing and Social Networks. Graph theory provides the foundation for more advanced topics and applications, such as special graphs like simple, r-regular, and complete graphs.

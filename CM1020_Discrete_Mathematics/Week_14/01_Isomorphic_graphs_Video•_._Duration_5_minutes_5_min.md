Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Two graphs, G1 and G2, are isomorphic if there exists a bijection (invertible function) F that maps all vertices of G1 to vertices of G2 while preserving adjacency and non-adjacency. This means that for any two vertices U and V in G1, if uv is an edge, then f(U)f(V) is an edge in G2, and vice versa. The concept of isomorphism aims to show that two graphs may appear different but are actually the same. An example of this can be seen with the graphs G1 and G2, where a mapping function f can be defined to establish isomorphism between them. A bijective function preserves adjacency and non-adjacency, as shown in the example of graph G1 mapped onto graph G2 using the function f. Two graphs cannot be isomorphic if they have different degree sequences. For instance, two 3-regular simple connected graphs with four vertices cannot be isomorphic due to their differing degree sequences. However, two graphs can have the same degree sequence and still not be isomorphic. This can be proven by showing that a one-to-one correspondence between the vertex sets of these graphs preserves adjacency but does not exist. The three graphs shown in the example are 2-regular simple connected with four vertices and exhibit isomorphism among themselves through bijection. Similarly, the two graphs shown in another example are 3-regular simple connected with six vertices and can be proven to be isomorphic through a bijective mapping function. In contrast, the final pair of graphs are 2-regular simple connected with five vertices but lack an identifiable bijection, hence cannot be proven to be isomorphic based on given criteria. The concept of isomorphism in graph theory highlights that similarity between graphs may imply underlying structural equivalence despite surface-level dissimilarities. Understanding this relationship between graph structure and adjacency through mapping functions can aid in identifying distinct patterns across various types of connected networks.

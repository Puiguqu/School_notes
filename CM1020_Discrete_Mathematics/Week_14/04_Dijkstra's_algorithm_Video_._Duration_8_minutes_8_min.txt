Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

1. Dijkstra's algorithm is used to compute the shortest path between two vertices in a weighted graph.
2. A weighted graph is a graph where each edge has a numerical value assigned to it, representing the distance or cost between nodes.
3. In 1956, Edsger Dijkstra introduced an algorithm to find the shortest path between any two nodes in a graph.
4. The algorithm works by iteratively selecting the unvisited vertex with the smallest known distance from the starting node and updating its neighbors' distances.
5. The first step of the algorithm is initialization, where the distance from the starting node to itself is set to zero, and all other distances are initialized to infinity.
6. The second step is the update step, where the algorithm visits each unvisited vertex with a known distance, updates its neighbors' distances if necessary, and marks it as visited.
7. This process continues until all vertices have been visited, resulting in a complete table of shortest distances from the starting node to any other node.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$

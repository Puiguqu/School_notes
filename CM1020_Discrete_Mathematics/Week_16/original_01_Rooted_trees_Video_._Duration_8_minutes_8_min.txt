Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key In this lesson, we will explore rooted trees in more detail. First, we will examine some key terminology of rooted trees. Then, we will define the depth and the height in a tree. We will also look at some examples of specific trees. Then, we will discuss some properties of rooted trees. Finally, we will define isomorphic rooted trees and show some of their properties. A rooted tree is a directed tree having one distinguished vertex r called a root, such that for every vertex, v, there is a directed path from r to v. For instance, the following tree T is a rooted tree and it's corresponding root is the vertex A. A directed tree is represented as a rooted tree if and only if one vertex has in-degree zero, whereas all other vertices have in-degree one. For instance, the following graph is a rooted tree as one of its vertices, the vertex A has an in-degree equal to zero, and all the other vertices B, C, D, E, and F have an in-degree equal to one. Let's consider the following tree and examine some key terminology around it. A is the root of the tree, B is called the parent of D, E and F are the children of D, B and A are ancestor of E and F, E and F are siblings, B and D are called internal nodes, C, E, and F are called external nodes. Now, let's define the depth and height in the tree. The depth or path length of a node in a tree is the number of edges from the root to that node. For instance, in the tree shown here, the path lengths for A, D, H, I and N are respectively zero, one, two, three, and four. The height of a node in a tree is the longest path from that node to a leaf. For instance, in the tree shown here, the path lengths for B, C, E, and N are respectively zero, three, two, zero. The depth of a tree also referred to as its height, is the maximum path length across all its nodes. For instance, the depth of this tree is four. Now, let's have a look at some special trees. A binary tree is a rooted tree in which every vertex has two or fewer children as shown in the tree T1. A ternary tree is a rooted tree in which every vertex has three or fewer children as shown in the tree T2. An m-ary tree is a rooted tree in which every vertex has m or fewer children as is shown in the tree T3. An m-ary tree is regular if every one of its internal nodes has exactly m children. For instance, B1 is a regular binary tree, B2 is not a regular binary tree. T1 is a regular ternary tree, T2 is not a regular ternary tree. Given an m-ary tree, at each level h, there are at most m_h vertices. Let's try to visualize this and consider the following tree T having h levels. If T is binary, the maximum number of vertices at level h is 2_h. If T is a ternary tree, the maximum number of vertices at level h is 3_h. Similarly, for an m-ary tree, the maximum number of vertices at level h is m_h. Also, the maximum number of edges in an m-ary of h levels is equal to m_h plus 1 minus 1 over m minus 1. Similarly, two graphs, two trees, T1 and T2 are isomorphic if there is a bijection f from a set of vertices of T1 to the set of vertices of T2 which preserves adjacency and non-adjacency. In other word, if uv is an edge in T1, then f of u, f of v is an edge in T2. Also, to say that T1 is equivalent to T2 is to say that T1 and T2 are isomorphic. Let's look at an example of this by considering the two trees T1 and T2. The function F from the vertices of T1 to the vertices of T2 is bijection. Therefore, T1 and T2 are isomorphic. The properties of graphs that we have seen before also apply to trees. Two trees with different degree sequence are not isomorphic. Two trees with the same degree sequence aren't necessarily isomorphic. For instance, let's consider the following trees, T1 and T2. T1 and T2 have the same degree sequence 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1. But T1 and T2 are not isomorphic. Now, let's define a more specific isomorphism for rooted trees. Two isomorphic trees are isomorphic as rooted trees if and only if there exists a bijection that maps the root of one tree to the root of the other tree. Also, isomorphic trees might or might not be isomorphic as rooted trees. For instance, the following two trees T1 with a root r1, and T2 with a root r2 are isomorphic as graphs, but not isomorphic as rooted trees. In this lecture, we began by defining a rooted trees, then we examined some of their key properties, we also looked at how to determine the depth and height in a tree, we considered the notion of regular rooted trees and some of their properties, then we revisited the concept of isomorphic trees. Finally, we defined isomorphic rooted trees and looked at some of their properties. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 8.2 Rooted trees and binary search trees.

Rooted trees are a fundamental concept in graph theory, which have wide-ranging applications in computer science, data structures and various algorithms. Understanding rooted trees equips you with the necessary skills to tackle problems involving hierarchical structures and recursive data. Below are the concepts we covered in this lesson: Understanding basic concepts: Rooted tree definition: comprehend the definition of a rooted tree and differentiate it from general trees and other types of graphs. Components of rooted trees: identify the root, parent, child, sibling, leaf and internal nodes in a rooted tree. Tree levels and height: understand the concepts of levels (or depth) and height of a rooted tree. Types of rooted trees: Binary trees: grasp the concept of binary trees where each node has at most two children. Binary search trees (BST): learn properties of BSTs and how they facilitate efficient searching, insertion and deletion operations. Balanced trees: study balanced trees like AVL trees and Red-Black trees which maintain balanced heights to ensure optimal performance. Lesson 8.2 Rooted trees and binary search trees.

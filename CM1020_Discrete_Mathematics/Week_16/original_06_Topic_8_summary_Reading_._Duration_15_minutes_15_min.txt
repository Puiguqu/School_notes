Trees play a crucial role in discrete mathematics and computer science due to their versatile applications in hierarchical data representation, efficient data structures, algorithm design, database management, artificial intelligence, computational biology and network design. Below is a summary of the key concepts we covered in this topic. Definition and basic concepts Tree: a connected, acyclic graph with n vertices has n−1 edges. Rooted tree: a tree with one designated root node parent-child relationship: every node (except the root) has exactly one parent. Components of trees: root: the topmost node leaf: a node with no children internal node: a node with at least one child height: the length of the longest path from the root to a leaf depth/level: the number of edges from the root to the node. Types of trees Binary tree: each node has at most two children (left and right). Binary search tree (BST): a binary tree with the property that the left child’s value is less than the parent’s value and the right child’s value is greater. Balanced trees: trees that maintain a balanced height to ensure efficient operations. Significant algorithms Binary search tree (BST): how BST is used to search for a value in a sorted list. Prim’s algorithm: finds the minimum spanning tree (MST) by building the tree one vertex at a time. Kruskal’s algorithm: finds the MST by adding edges in order of increasing weight, ensuring no cycles are formed. Key properties Sum of degrees: the sum of degrees of all vertices in a tree is 2(n−1) where n is the number of vertices. Number of edges: a tree with n vertices has n−1 edges. By understanding these concepts, you will be equipped to analyse and work with various types of trees in graph theory, implement efficient algorithms and apply these structures to solve real-world problems. As you progress through your course, it is crucial to regularly assess your understanding and capabilities against the learning outcomes. This exercise is designed to help you reflect on your learning journey, identify areas where you may need to deepen your knowledge or skills, and develop a plan for improvement. Please follow the steps below: Review the learning outcomes. For each of this topic’s learning outcomes, rate your understanding on a scale of 1-5 (1 = very low, 5 = very high). Provide a brief explanation for your rating. Identify areas for improvement. Review your ratings and explanations: Identify any areas where you rated your understanding below a 4. For each area identified, describe specific aspects you find challenging or unclear. Create an action plan. For each identified knowledge gap, outline specific actions you will take to improve your understanding. Consider the following strategies: Reviewing the course materials and textbooks. Seek out additional resources that could aid your understanding. Practicing additional problems or exercises. Seeking help from the instructor or peers. Scheduling additional study sessions on the topic. Implement your action plan and regularly review your progress. Adjust your strategies as needed based on your ongoing self-assessment and any new feedback you receive. Remember, learning is a continuous process, and it’s okay to revise your plan to better suit your needs. Lesson 8.2 Rooted trees and binary search trees. Video: Video Rooted trees .

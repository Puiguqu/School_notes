It appears that the provided text is not a complete solution to a problem, but rather a transcript of a lecture or presentation on "Properties of Relations" in mathematics. The text outlines the concepts of reflexivity, symmetry, and anti-symmetry, as well as their graphical representations using matrices and digraphs.

There is no specific problem or question being addressed in the provided text, and it does not contain step-by-step solutions or answers to a particular problem. However, I can provide a summary of the key points discussed in the lecture:

1. Definition of a relation: A relation between two sets is a subset of their Cartesian product.
2. Properties of relations:
	* Reflexivity: A relation R on a set A is reflexive if for all x in A, (x, x) is in R.
	* Symmetry: A relation R on a set A is symmetric if for all x and y in A, if (x, y) is in R, then (y, x) is also in R.
	* Anti-symmetry: A relation R on a set A is anti-symmetric if for all x and y in A, if (x, y) is in R and (y, x) is in R, then x = y.
3. Graphical representations:
	* Matrix representation: A relation R on a set A can be represented as a matrix M, where the entry at row i and column j represents the number of ordered pairs (i, j) in R.
	* Digraph representation: A relation R on a set A can be represented as a digraph, which is a directed graph where each vertex represents an element of A, and there is a directed edge from vertex x to vertex y if (x, y) is in R.

If you could provide more context or clarify what specific problem or question you would like me to help with, I'll be happy to assist you further.

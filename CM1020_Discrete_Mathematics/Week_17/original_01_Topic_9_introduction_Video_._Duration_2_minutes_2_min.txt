First, we will give an overview of relations in general then we will introduce the concept of relations in terms of mathematics. Often in mathematics, we come across the word relation. Generally speaking, by a relation we usually understand some connection between two living or nonliving things. Relationship between elements of sets occur in many contexts. We deal with relationships on daily basis, a relationship between a person and a relative like the relations of mother-daughter, brother-sister, et cetera. We are quite familiar with these relations. A relationship between an employee and his or her salary. A relationship between a business and it's telephone number. A relationship between a computer language and a valid statement in this language will often arise in computer science. We will learn about a new concept of relations in mathematics. In mathematics, we study relationships such as a relationship between a positive integer and one that it divides, a relationship between two real numbers or relationship between a real number x and the value of f of x where f is a function, and so on. Mathematically, we can also define the relationship between the elements of two sets. We can also define the relationship between two elements of the same set. In this topic, we will discuss relations in terms of mathematics as well as their properties in detail. In this video lecture, we introduced the concept of relations. First, we gave a general overview of relations then we discussed the meaning of relations in terms of mathematics. In the next lecture, we will discuss relations in more detail. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Video: Video Topic 9 introduction .

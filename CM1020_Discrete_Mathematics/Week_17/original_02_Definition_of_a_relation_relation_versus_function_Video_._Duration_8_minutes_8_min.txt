Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key In this lecture, we will look in more detail at the concept of relations in terms of mathematics. We will give an initial definition of a relation. We will then define the Cartesian product before giving a formal definition of relations between elements of two sets. Finally, we will define a relation between elements of the same set. A relation can be defined between element of a set A and elements of another set B. A relation can also be defined between elements of the same set. We always use the letter R to refer to a relation. In a more formal way, let A and B be two sets. Let R be a relation linking element of the set A to elements of the set B. Let x be an element of the set A and y be an element of the set B. We say that x is related to y with respect to the relation R and we write x R y which means x is related to y. A relation can also be defined between element of the same set. A relation is a link or connection between two elements of a set. For example, a person x is a son of a person y. A son of is a relation that links x to y. We usually use the letter R to refer to a relation. In this case, the relation R is son of. If x is a son of y, we write x R y which means x is related to y. If y is not a son of x, we write y not related to x. A relation can be defined as a link or a connection between element of a set A to element of a set B. Let's consider an example where the set A is a set of students in computer science program containing the names Sofia, Samir, and Sarah. And the set B are the courses that the department offers containing Mathematics, Java, Databases, and Art. Let R be a relation linking students in the set A to classes they are enrolled in. A student is related to a course if the student is enrolled on this course. Let's consider the example of the following relations. Sophia is enrolled in Mathematics and Java. Samir is enrolled in Java and Databases. Whereas Sarah is enrolled in Mathematics and Art. Sophia is not enrolled in Art. Those relation can be noted as follows. Sophia is related to Mathematics, Sophia is related to Java. Samir is related to Java, Samir is related to Databases. Sarah is related to Mathematics, Sarah is related to Art. Sophia is not related to Art as Sofia is not enrolled in Art. Let's now define the Cartesian products of two sets, A and B. The Cartesian product of A and B written as a A x B is defined by a set of pairs, x, y, such that x is an element of the set A and y is an element of the set B. For example, let A be the set containing a1 and a2, and B be the set containing the elements b1, b2, and b3. The Cartesian product of A and B is the set of the pairs (a1, b1), (a1, b2), (a1, b3), (a2, b1), (a2, b2), and (a2, b3). Let's now examine a more formal way to describe relations. A binary relation from a set A to a set B is a subset of a Cartesian product A x B. R is included in the Cartesian product of A and B means R is a set of ordered pairs of the form (x,y) where x is an element of A, and y is an element of B, and x is related to y. The pair (x,y) is an element of R means that x is related to y. For example, let A be the set containing the elements a, b, and c. And B is the set containing the elements 1, 2, and 3. The following is a relation defined from A to B where R is a set of pairs (a, 1), (b, 2), and (c, 3). This means that a is related to 1, b is related to 2, and c is related to 3. When the sets A and B are the same, we talk about a relation on the set A. In other words a relation R and the set A is a relation from A to A and R is a subset of A x A. We will generally be studying these type of relations. Let R be a relation on the set A, given x, y element of the set A, x is related to y if and only if x is strictly less than y. We have 1 is related to 2, 1 is related to 3, 1 is related to 4, 2 is related to 3, 2 is related to 4, 3 is related to 4. R is the set of pairs (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), and (3, 4). In this lecture, the concept of relations in terms of mathematics was introduced. We first gave an initial definition of what a relation is. We then defined the Cartesian product of two sets before giving a formal definition of a relation. Finally, we talked about the relation between elements of the same set. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Video: Video Topic 9 introduction .

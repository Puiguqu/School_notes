Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key In this lesson, we will discuss three properties of relations. We will look at what it means to say that a relation is reflexive, symmetric, and anti-symmetric. We will then examine the behavior of the G graph and the adjacency matrix of relations satisfying each of these three properties. We now define the first property which is reflexivity. A relation R on a set S is said to be reflexive, if and only if for all x element of S, x is related to x. In other words for all x, element of the set S, the pair xx is an element of R. Now let's have a look at an example of a reflexive relation. Let R be a relation on elements of Z, where the pair a, b is an element of R if and only if a is less than or equal to for all a, b elements of Z. Clearly for all x, elements of Z, we have x is less than or equal to x. Hence x is related to x. This implies that this relation is a reflexive relation. Now, let's contrast this against an example of a relation that isn't reflexive. Let R be a relation on elements in Z, where the pair a, b is an element of R if and only if a is strictly less than b for all a, b elements of Z. Clearly, for all x, elements of Z, we have x is not strictly less than x. Therefore x is not related to x. For example, 1 is an element of Z, however, 1 is not strictly less than 1. Hence 1 is not related to 1. This implies that this relation is not reflexive. Now we are going to work through an exercise that demonstrates what you have learned so far. Given the following two relations R_1 and R_2, we need to show which one is reflexive. The first relation R_1 is reflexive, as for all a, elements of Z, we have a modulus 2 is equal to a modulus 2. Hence a is related to a. However, the second relation R_2 is not reflexive, as for all element a of Z, we have a minus a is equal to 0, which is different from 2, hence a is not related to a for all a in Z. We only need to find one element of Z which is not related to itself to show that our relation is not reflexive. In this case, 1 is not related to 1. Now let's have a look at the digraph presenting reflexive relation on elements of a set S. The digraph of a relation R on a set S contains a loop on every elements of S. Let S be a set containing four elements one, two, three and four. Let R be a relation on S where the relation is less than or equal. The corresponding digraph shows a loop on every element of S as every element is related to itself. Now let's look at the matrix representing reflexive relation. Let M_r be the adjacency matrix of a reflexive relation. Then all the values of the diagonal of M_r are equal to 1. Let's take the same example that we looked at earlier to illustrate this property. Again, let S be a set containing the elements one, two, three, four, and let R be a relation on elements of S, where R is less than or equal. The corresponding matrix M_r of or the relation R shows the all the values of the diagonal are equal to 1. This means that if there exists one element in the diagonal of the matrix M_r, that is equal to 0, then the relation is not reflexive. Now let's define another property of relations known as symmetry. A relation R defined on elements of a set S is said to be symmetric, if and only if for all elements a and b of S, if a is related to b then b is related to a. Let's take a look at an example of a symmetric relation. Let R be a relation on elements in Z. Where the pair a, b is an element of R, if and only if a modulus 2 is equal to b modulus 2. This relation is symmetric and this can be shown as follow. Let a and b be elements of Z. Let's assume that a is related to b. We then need to show that B is related to A. So we start by A is related to B. This implies that A modulus two is equal to B modulus two which implies that B modulus two is equal to A modulus two as the equal relation is a commutative relation. This leads us to say that B is related to A. Therefore, R is a symmetric relation. The digraph of a symmetric relation on elements in a set S contains a symmetric pair of arcs for every edge of S. This means that there exist no single arrow between any two different vertices of the D graph. There are either no edges or two parallel edges showing the relation is both ways. Let's illustrate this by returning to the example that we saw earlier. Let S be the set containing the elements 1, 2, 3, 4, and let R be the relation on elements of S. Where A is related to B means that A modulus two is equal to B modulus two for all AB elements of S. The corresponding D graph shows that there is no single connection between any two different vertices. There is either no connection, for example, no connection between one and two, or connection in both ways, for example, parallel edges between one and three, or between two and four. Now let's look at the matrix of a symmetric relation. Let MR be the matrix of a relation R. If R is a symmetric then the matrix MR is symmetric. For instance, let's consider the relation R that we saw earlier. We have already shown that this relation is symmetric. As you can see, the corresponding matrix MR of this relation is symmetric with respect to the diagonal. Now let's move on to define the third property of relations known as anti-symmetry. A relation R defined on elements in a set S is said to be anti-symmetric if and only if for all A and B elements of S, if A is related to B and B is related to A then A must be equal to B. This means that if the relation is anti-symmetric, then no two different elements are related both ways. Now let's have a look at an example of a relation that is anti-symmetric. Let R be a relation on elements in Z where the pair AB is an element of R if and only if A is less than or equal to B. Let's now show that this relation is anti-symmetric. Let A and B be elements in Z where A is related to B and B is related to A. This implies that A is less or equal to B, and B is less than or equal to A. This implies that A is equal to B. Therefore, R is an anti-symmetric relation. The diagraph of an anti-symmetric relation on elements in a set S contains no parallel edges between any two different vertices. To illustrate this property, let S be a set containing the elements 1, 2, 3, and 4 and let R be a relation on S where the pair AB is an element of R if and only if A divides B. The corresponding D graph shows that there are no parallel edges between any two different vertices. Now, let's look at the matrix of an anti-symmetric relation. Let MR be the matrix of an anti-symmetric relation. Then if any element of the matrix MIJ is different from zero then its corresponding symmetry with respect to the diagonal MJI is equal to zero. To illustrate this property, let's consider the relation that we discussed earlier. A is related to B if and only if A divides B. The corresponding matrix MR shows that if I is not equal to J and MIJ is not equal to zero, then its corresponding symmetry with respect to the diagonal MJI is equal to zero. Let's work through an exercise to summarize the concepts we have covered in this lecture. Let R be the relation defined by the matrix MR. Is R reflexive, symmetric, or anti-symmetric? Clearly R is not reflexive because the element M11 is equal to zero. It is not symmetric because M21 is equal to one, and M12 is equal to zero. However, this relation is anti-symmetric. In this lesson we have explored three properties of relations. These are the properties of reflexivity, symmetry, and anti-symmetry. We then studied the behavior of the digraph. I looked at the adjacency matrix of relations satisfying each of these three properties. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Video: Video Topic 9 introduction .

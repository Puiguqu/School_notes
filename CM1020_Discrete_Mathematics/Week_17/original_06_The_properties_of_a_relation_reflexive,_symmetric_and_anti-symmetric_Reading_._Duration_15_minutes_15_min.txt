In discrete mathematics, particularly in the study of relations, there are several key properties that a relation can possess. Understanding these properties helps in analysing the nature of relationships between elements in a set. In this lesson we covered three properties: reflexivity, symmetry and anti-symmetry. Below is summary of these three properties: 1. Reflexive relation A relation R on a set A is reflexive if every element in A is related to itself. Formally, R is reflexive if: ∀a∈A, aRa Example of a reflexive relation Let A={1,2,3} and R={(1,1),(2,2),(3,3)}. Here, R is reflexive because each element in A is related to itself. Example of non-reflexive relation: Let A={1,2,3} and R={(1,1),(2,2)}. Here, R is not reflexive because (3,3)∈ / R. 2. Symmetric relation A relation R on a set A is symmetric if for every pair (a,b)∈R, the pair (b,a) is also in R. Formally, R is symmetric if: ∀a,b∈A,(a,b)∈R⟹(b,a)∈R Example of a symmetric relation: Let A={1,2} and R={(1,2),(2,1)}. Here, R is symmetric because if (1,2)∈R, then (2,1)∈R and vice versa. Example of non-symmetric relation: Let A={1,2} and R={(1,2)}. Here, R is not symmetric because (2,1)∈ / R. 3. Anti-symmetric relation A relation R on a set A is anti-symmetric if for every pair (a,b)∈R where a  =b, the pair (b,a) is not in R. Formally, R is anti-symmetric if: ∀a,b∈A,(a,b)∈R and (b,a)∈R⟹a=b Example of anti-symmetric relation: Let A={1,2,3} and R={(1,1),(2,2),(3,3),(1,2)}. Here, R is anti-symmetric because there are no pairs (a,b) and (b,a) for a  =b. Example of non-anti-symmetric relation: Let A={1,2} and R={(1,2),(2,1)}. Here, R is not anti-symmetric because both (1,2) and (2,1) are in R and 1  =2. Summary Reflexive: Every element is related to itself. Symmetric: If an element is related to another, then the second element is related to the first. Anti-symmetric: If an element is related to another and vice versa, then they must be the same element. Understanding these properties is crucial for analysing relations in sets, which is a foundational concept in discrete mathematics with applications in computer science, particularly in database theory and graph theory. In the next lesson we will look at another important property transitivity. Video: Video Topic 9 introduction . Duration: 2 minutes 2 min Discussion Prompt: Investigate and discuss .

Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key In this lesson, we will define and discuss two more properties of relations. First, we will define what it means to say that a relation is a partial order. And we will look at some examples demonstrating this concept. Then, we will give a definition of a total order. Let's begin by defining a partial order. Let R be a relation on elements in a set S. R is said to be a partial order if and only if R is reflexive, anti-symmetric, and transitive. Now, let's look at an example of a partial order. By returning to the following relation discussed in previous lessons, let R be a relation on elements in Z where the pair a, b is an element of R if and only if a is less than or equal to b. We have already shown that this relation is reflexive, as a is less or equal to a for all a elements in Z. It's transitive, as if a is less or equal to b, and b is less or equal to c, then a is less or equal to c for all abc elements in Z. It is also anti-symmetric. As if a is less or equal to b, and b is less or equal to a, then a must be equal to b for all a b elements in Z. Therefore, the relation R is a partial order. Let's have a look at another example of a partial order. Let R be a relation on our elements in Z-plus set of positive integers where the pair a, b is an element of R if and only if a divides b. It can easily be proved the R is reflexive as a divides a for all a in Z-plus. Transitive, as if a divides b, and b divides c, then a divides c for all abc elements in Z-plus. It is also anti-symmetric as if a divides b, and b divides a, then a must be equal to b for all elements ab in Z-plus. This means that this relation R is a partial order as it is reflexive, anti-symmetric, and transitive. Now, let's move on to define a total order. Let R be a relation on elements in a set S. R is said to be a total order if and only if R is a partial order, and for all ab elements in S, we have either a is related to b or b is related to a. This means that R has to be a partial order, and every two elements of the set S can be comparable with respect to the relation R. Let's have a look at an example demonstrating this by considering the same relation R discussed earlier in this lecture, where a pair, ab, is an element of R if and only if a is less than or equal to b. We have already shown that this relation is a partial order. Also, if we take any two elements a, b of Z, we have either a is less than or equal to b or b is less than or equal to a. Therefore, we can conclude that this relation is a total order. Now, let's look at an example of a relation that is a partial order but that is not a total order. Let R be a relation discussed earlier in this lecture, where a pair a, b is an element of R if and only if a divides b. It has been proved that or is a partial order. However, there exists elements of Z-plus which are incomparable with respect to this relation. For example, 5 doesn't divide 7, and 7 doesn't divide 5. Therefore, this relation is a partial order, but it isn't a total order. This means that some elements are comparable with respect to R, but some are not. In this lesson, we defined and discussed two more properties of relations, partial and total orders. First, we defined a partial order and discussed some examples demonstrating this property. We also explained what it means to say that a relation is a total order. And looked at the difference between partial and total orders. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 9.2 Equivalence, and partial and total order relations Video: Video Equivalence relations and equivalence classes .

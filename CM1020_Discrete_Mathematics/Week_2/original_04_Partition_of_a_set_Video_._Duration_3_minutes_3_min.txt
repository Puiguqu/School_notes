Data partitioning has many applications in Computer Science, such as big data analysis. In this short video, we will define the partition of a set using examples to explain clearly what a partition is. Two sets A and B are said to be disjointed if and only if their corresponding intersection is equal to the empty set. The Venn diagram shown here shows two sets A and B. Clearly both sets have no element in common. Hence, the intersection of A and B is equal to the empty set. Therefore, the sets A and B are disjointed. A partition of a set A is a set of subsets A_i of A, such that all the subsets A_i are disjointed and the union of all the subset A_i is equal to A. Now let's have a look at an example to illustrate this. You can see here the sets A_1 to A_5 are subsets of A. The figure clearly shows that for i is equal to one to five, all the subsets A_i are disjointed. The union of all the five subsets, A_i is equal to the set A. This means that the collection of subsets A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, and A_5 is a partition of A. Now, I'm going to ask you to do an exercise which puts into practice what you have learned in this lecture. Given a set S containing five elements which are; 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, which one of the following collection of subsets of S is a partition of S? You can now pause the video and have a go. The first one is a partition as the union is equal to S, and all the elements are mutually disjointed. In the case of the second one, although the union of all the subsets is equal to S, it is not a partition because the set containing three and four is not disjointed to the set containing four and five, and their intersection is different from an empty set. Finally, although the subsets are disjointed in the final case, it is not a partition, as the union of all the sets is not equal to S. In this lecture, we have looked at disjointed sets and the definition of a partition, along with some example to illustrate this. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 1.2 Set representation and manipulation Video: Video The representation of a set using Venn diagrams .

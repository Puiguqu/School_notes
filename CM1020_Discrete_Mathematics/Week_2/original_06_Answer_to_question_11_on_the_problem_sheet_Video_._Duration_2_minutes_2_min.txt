Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key Question 2, let A = [1, 2] and let B = [2, 3]. Find each of the following, the powerset of A intersection B, the powerset of A union B, and the powerset of A cross B. Given a set S, the powerset of S, P(S), is a set containing all subsets of S. Now the intersection of two sets is given by the elements x which are in both A and B. So A intersection B = [2], because only 2 is in both set A and in set B in this instance. So the powerset of A intersection B, which is a set containing all the subsets of A intersection B, comprises the empty set and the set 2. The union of two sets is given by the elements which are in either A or in B. In this case, A union B = [1, 2, 3]. The powerset of A union B, which is the set containing all the subsets of A union B, comprises the empty set and then [1], [2], [3], [1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3], and [1, 2, 3]. Finally, the Cartesian product of two sets, A cross B, can be given by (x, y), where x is from A and y is from B. In this case, A cross B = [1,2), (1,3), (2,2), and (2,3)]. And the powerset of A cross B is given by all of the subsets of A cross B, which are phi, then all the subsets with one element or the subsets with two elements, all the subsets with three elements, and the subset with four elements. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 1.2 Set representation and manipulation Lesson 1.3 Extra resources Reading: Reading Sets problem sheet .

You know my name now, I'm Lahcen Ouarbya, and I'm the module leader for discrete mathematics. Today's topic is about sets. I'll give you a broad summary of what you need to know and relation that you need to know about Topic 1, which is set theory. We will look at the concept of a subset of a set, set operation and membership table, we will look at the complement of a set, a Venn diagram, and how Venn diagram is used to prove that two sets are equivalent, then we'll look at some set identities, and at the end, we look at the definition of a powerset of a set, and we'll go through some examples on the way. As you already know, a set is just a collection of objects. Objects can be anything, can be human, can be numbers, can be real numbers, natural numbers, integer, anything. A set is a collection of objects. A set A is said to be a subset of a set B if and only if every element of A is also an element of B. In this case, we use this notation to say that A is a subset of B, means that all the elements of A are also element of the set B. This is just a formal definition of what a subset of a set is. I repeat, a set A is a subset of a set B if and only if every element of A is also an element of B. We'll write it formally like this, A is a subset of B which is equivalent. If you take any x which any element x in A, then x is also an element of B. Take any element in A is also an element of B. That's the formal definition of what a subset is. Let's look at an example. We've got a set A has got the element 1, 2, 3, and a set B have the element 1, 2, 4, and a set C has got 1, 2, 3, 4. We can see that A is a subset of C. Why? Because all those elements 1, 2, 3, are also element of C. We can also see that B is a subset of C because if you look at all the element 1, 2, 4, are also element of C. C has got 1, has got 2, has got 4. However, A is not a subset of B. Why? Because there's 3 here in A which is not in B. Therefore, we can say that A is not a subset of B. Similarly, B is not a subset of A, as 4 is an element of B, however, 4 is not an element of A. Now we know what a subset is. A set A is a subset of B if all the element of A are also element of the set B. Now let's look at some set operation. First thing, is we look at the set union. If we have two sets, A and B, the union of both sets A and B, we'll write AUB, that's the union, contains all the element of A, all the element of B. In another way, the union would join all the element of A and the element of B in one set. Formally, we'll write it, A union B is a set of element x, such that x is either in A or x is either in B. If an element is in A, it should be in A union B, is an element if in B, it should also be in A union B, and that's what the union is, and we'll look at one example. We take two sets, A has got 1, 2, 3 and B has got 1, 2, 4. If you look at A union B, we just take all those elements in A and B and join them together. We put all the element in A, which is 1, 2, 3, and here we add 1, 2, 4, to A because in a set, we'll write an element only once, so we can only put 1, 2, 3, 4, but we don't need to write 1 and 2 twice. We just join the elements together but write each element only once. Now we also looked at the membership table. This is just an example. We look at the membership table of A union B. Here's two sets, A and B. Here is all the possibility, we take one element and we check, 1 means it belongs to the set, and 0 means it does not belong to the set. We've got two sets, A and B. Here 0 means it's not an element of A, not an element of B, will it be an element of the A union B? Of course, not. If it's not in A, not in B, it won't be in the A union B. Second option, is not an element of A, but it's an element of B. Therefore, it is an element of A union B. A third option is, is contained in A but is not an element of B, it's also an element of A union B. The final possibility is, it's an element of A and an element of B, therefore, it's also an element of A union B. This is the membership table of A union B. Let's now look at another set operation is the intersection. Given two sets, A and B, the intersection of A and B, written as A and this sign here for the intersection, is the set of element that are in both A and in B. In another way, is the set of element that A and B have in common. Formally, we'll write A intersection B is the set of element x, such that x is an element of A, and x is an element of B. Let's look at an example for the intersection, we use the same one. A has got three element 1, 2, and 3, and B has got 1, 2, and 4. The intersection of A and B is the elements that are both in A and in B, in this case, is 1 is here and is in B, 2 is in A as in B, 3 is only in A, not in B, then it shouldn't be there, 4 is only in B, it's not in A, so what those two sets have in common is these element 1 and 2. The intersection of A and B in this case, it's just the set containing 1 and 2, because 1 and 2 are the only elements that A and B have in common. Let's now look at the membership table of A intersection B. If we have an element, first case, it's not in A, it's not in B, will it be in the intersection? No. If it's not in A, not in B, then it's not in the intersection of A and B. Then we take the next possibility, it's not in A, but in B, therefore, it's not in the intersection of A and B. Third possibility is, it's an element of A, but it's not an element of B, therefore, it shouldn't be an element of A intersection B. Final case is, it's an element of A and an element of B and therefore, it's in A and in B, then it's an element of A intersection B. This is the membership table of A intersection B. Now, we'll look at another set operation which is the set difference. Given two sets, A and B, the set difference, written as A minus B, contains all the element of A that are not in B. In another way, take all the elements of A and cross any element from it that's in B. We can write this set formally, A minus B is the set of element x such that x is in A and x is not in B. Then we'll look at one example. Let's look at this example here. A has got 1, 2, 3 and B has got 1, 2, 4. One second. A minus B is all the element that are in A but they are not in B, which element is in A and is not in B? 1 is in B, then it shouldn't be there, 2 is in B, then it shouldn't be there, then 3 is in A but it's not in B. One second. Let me just write this set. If I have A is got 1, 2, 3, and I have got B is got 1, 2, 4, so A minus B, you just write all the element of A, and go to B and take minus B, 1, 2, 4. Let's not even do that. One second. Write this element of A and go to B and C, is 1 in B? Yes. Cross it. Is 2 in B? Cross it. Is 3 in B? No. Therefore, A minus B will be just the set containing the element 3. Now, let's go and look at the membership table for A minus B. First case, if we have an element, we check, first possibility is not an element of A, is not an element of B, therefore, it's not an element of A minus B either. It's not an element of A but it is an element of B, it shouldn't be an element of A minus B either. It's an element of A which is not an element of B, then it will be an element of A minus B. It's an element of A and an element of B, then it shouldn't be an element of A minus B. This is the membership table of the set difference. Now we look at another set operation is the symmetric difference. The symmetric difference of A and B is the set of elements that are in A or in B but not in both. The symmetric difference is really join them and take away anything that the two sets have in common. We can write this formally, we use the plus with a circle here to represent the symmetric difference. Formally, the symmetric difference of A and B is the set of element x, such that x is in A, or x is in B, but x is not in the intersection of A and B. We can write that the symmetric difference of A and B is just the union, join them together and take away anything that A and B have in common. Let's look at this example. We have A has got 1, 2, 3 and we have got B has got 1, 2, 4. 1 is in A and B, then it should not be in the symmetric difference of A and B, 2 is in both of sets, then it shouldn't be in A plus B, 3 is in A, but it's not in B, then 3 should be an element of the A plus B, 4 is an element of B, but it's not an element of A, then 4 will also be an element of A plus B. If I want to go and give you an example, then let's just go to this example here. One second. Then I want you to know is A plus B. What you need to do first is put all those elements, join them, 1, 2, 3, 4, join all those element, then start taking away from them, taking away any element that they have in common. 1 is in A and 1 is in B, then I cross 1, 2 is in A and it's in B, then I cross 2, 3 is only in A, then I leave it, 4 is only in B, then I leave it, save the 4. A plus B, which is the symmetric difference of A, it will be just the set containing element 3 and 4. Let's now look at the membership table of the symmetric difference. We've got two sets, A and B. First case, if we have an element, it's not in A and it's not in B, therefore, it won't be an element of A plus B. If we have an element which is not in A but it is in B, then it's an element of the symmetric difference of A and B. If we have an element which is in A, but it's not in B, then also it is an element of a symmetric difference of A plus B. If we have an element in A and it is in B, then it's not in the symmetric difference of A and B. This is the membership table of the symmetric difference of A plus B. Let's now try to use the membership table to prove that the intersection of A and B is the same as A minus bracket B minus A. We don't know if those two sets are equivalent. First what we do, we try to build a membership table for A intersection B and build the membership table for B minus A minus B minus A, and if both columns for A intersection B and B minus B minus A are the same likes in this case, you can see those two columns are the same, therefore, we can say A intersection B is equal to B minus bracket B minus A. One way of proving that two sets are equivalence is to build the membership table for each one of them, then see if both columns for those two sets are the same, then you can deduce those two sets are the same. If they differ in one line, in one row, then they are different. Both columns have to be identical when you build the membership table. Now, let's look at another concept that we looked at which is the complement of a set. First, let's look at the concept of the universal set. A universal set is a set that contains everything, is the universe. We note, we always use the letter U to refer to the universal set. Any other set is contained in the universal set. The complement of a set A, which is written as A bar, contains all the elements that are in the universal set but are not in A. In another way, the complement of a set is the universal set U minus A, takeaway from it any element that's in A. The complement of a set A is the universal set minus the set A. Also we have this property, if you join the complement of a set with its complement, you should get the universal set U. Also the intersection of a set and its complement is always empty set. There is nothing in common between a set and its complement. Those properties we can use them when we're trying to prove things, when we're trying to prove that two sets are the same, that we will see later in some examples. This is what you need to remember, that the complement of a set is the universal set minus the set itself, the union of a set and its complement and it's always equal to the universal set, and the intersection of a set and its complement is always equal to the empty set. Let's look at one example here. Suppose we have got a universal set, we assume that our universe is only the set containing 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, it is comma here, not 6.7, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. This is our universal set, and the set A is the set of even number which is 2, 4, 6, 8, 9, this is not 0.8 again, is a comma 8 here. We can see the A is a subset of U. The complement of A is all the elements that are in U but are not in A. In another way, we're left with what? Odd numbers, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. If a set A has got 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10, then the complement of A has got 1, 3, 5, 7, 9. You can see that if I join this set A with its complement, I'll get the universal set U. If I intersect this set A with its complements, it's an empty set. They have nothing in common. This is set of even numbers and this is a set has got only odd numbers. The intersection is always an empty set. Now, let's look at another concept that we looked at which is the Venn diagram. Venn diagram is used to visualize the possible relations among a collection of sets. Another way is Venn diagram is used to visualize sets. We can have some visual information about sets. We can see that from Venn diagram, if two sets are different or they are the same, that's what we would be looking at. The universal set U, where I present this rectangle here, which is contains everything. This is the universal set U in Venn diagram. Any other set, A is a subset of the universal set U. This is the universal set, the whole rectangle, and you can see that A, any other set is inside the universal set, is contained in the universal set. U and a set A is a subset of the universal set U. We said that now the Venn diagram for the complement of A is anything in the universal set excluding all the elements that are in A. This is the Venn diagram. This orange area represents the set A and here, the orange area represents the complement of a set A, which you can see that anything in the universal set but take away from it all these elements that are in A. Now, we can write the Venn diagram for the union of two sets. If we have a universal set U and we have a set A and we have a set B, the union is join them together, so this is now the orange area here represents the union of A and B. Similarly, we can find Venn diagram of A intersection B. What did we say about A intersection B? Is the element that A and B have in common, which is this area here. This orange area here, it's all those elements there are in A and are in B, is the area that is common to A and B. This is now the Venn diagram for A intersection B. Now, we do the Venn diagram for A minus B. Venn diagram for A minus B is the whole set A, but take away from it anything that is in B. All set A but we take this area from it because those elements are also in B. This is the Venn diagram for A minus B. Now, the Venn diagram for the symmetric difference of A and B. As we said, the symmetric difference is join them and take away from them anything that they have in common. This area here in white is the area of the elements that A and B have in common. We join them together, which is the union, but take away this area here that is common to both A and B. Now, that is the Venn diagram of the symmetric difference of A and B. Now, let's use Venn diagram to show that two sets are equivalent or are similar or are the same. I want to show here that A plus B is equal to the union of A and B minus the intersection of A and B. One way of showing this, as we have seen before, is using the membership table. We can also use Venn diagram to show that two sets are equivalent. Here is the Venn diagram for A plus B that we've just seen. This orange area here represents the symmetric difference of A plus B. Now, here is the area that represents A union B minus the intersection of A and B. A union B will be everything minus the intersection, is take away this area here. As you can see, colored area in orange are the same in both diagram. This is the diagram of A plus B and this is the diagram of A union B minus the intersection. If both colored area are the same, therefore, we can say that the symmetric difference of A and B is equal to the union of A and B minus the intersection of A and B. We can also use Venn diagram to prove that two sets are equivalent. We looked at the membership table, we looked at the union, the intersection, the set difference, we also looked at the Venn diagram for each one of them, then we also in Topic 1, we looked at the concept of De Morgan's law. De Morgan's law describe how mathematical statements and concepts are related to their opposites and logic are related to their negation. But in set theory, De Morgan's law relate to the intersection and union of sets through their complements. We can have a look. The first law of De Morgan's law that we've looked at is the complement of the union of two sets, A and B, is equal to the intersection of their complement, which means given two sets, A and B, the complement of A union B is equal to the complement of A on its own intersection the complement of B in its own. That's the first De Morgan's law. The second one is the complement of the intersection is equal to the union of complements. That is, if you take A and B and you take the complement of A intersection B, is equal to the complement of A union the complement of B on its own. If you can't remember, remember just one of them. If you remember the first one, the second one is you substitute union by the intersection and the intersection by the union to get the second one, of two De Morgan's law. The complement of A union B is equal to the complement of A intersection the complement of B. The complement of A intersection B is equal to the complement of A union the complement of B. We now want to prove that those De Morgan's law are correct. We've looked at, you can prove them using the membership table, we can prove them using a Venn diagram. We can prove that this set is the same as this set. Let's look first at the membership table. We want to prove now that the complement of A union B is equal to the complement of A intersection the complement of B. Using the membership table, we can do that. We have A, B complement of A, complement of B, A union B, the complement of A union B, then the complement of A intersection the complement of B. If you go through all the cases, it's not an element of A, not an element of B, therefore, it's an element of the complement of A and it's an element of the complement of B. It's not an element of A union B, then it's an element of the complement of A union B, then it's an element of the complement of A and an element of the complement of B, then it's also an element of the complement of A intersection the complement of B. If we go to all those cases one by one, we can see that both columns are the same. Those two columns here are the same. Therefore, A complement of A union B is equal to the complement of A intersection the complement of B. One way of proving this is using the membership table. is prove the other De Morgan's law, which is the complement of A intersection B is equal to the complement of A union the complement of B. Similarly, we did exactly the same thing. We have A, we have B, we have complement of A, complement of B, A intersection B, and complement of A intersection B, then the complement of A union the complement of B. We start again case by case. It's not an element of A, not an element of B, therefore, it's an element of the complement of A and it's also an element of the complement of B. Because it's not in A, it's not in B, then it's not an element on the intersection. Because it's not an element of the intersection of A and B, therefore, it should be an element of the complement of A intersection B. Because it's an element of the complement of A and an element of the complement of B, therefore, it's an element of the complement of A union the complement of B. We can go here again. Case 2, it's not an element of A, but it is an element of B, therefore, it's not an element of the complement of A, but it is an element of the complement of B. Because it's not an element of B, or an element of A, so it's not an element of the intersection of A and B. Because it's not an element of the intersection of A and B, then it is an element of the complement of the A and B. Because it's an element of the complement of A, then it is an element of the complement of A union the complement of B, and so on, you go case by case and you can find that this column and this column are exactly the same thing. Therefore, we can say that this set here, which is the complement of A intersection B, is equal to the complement of A union the complement of B. Now, we can do the same thing using Venn diagram. We can now prove correctness. We just proved correctness of De Morgan's law using membership tables. We can also prove De Morgan's law using Venn diagram. Let's prove the first one. The complement of A union B is equal to the complement of A intersection the complement of B. What we do with all Venn diagram for this one and Venn diagram for this one, and we can look if those two Venn diagrams are the same. If they are, then those two sets are exactly the same. We start. Here is the Venn diagram for A union B. Then here is the Venn diagram of the complement of A union B, means any things in universal set take away any things in A union B. Now, this is the Venn diagram for the complement of A union B. Now, let's look. Here is the Venn diagram for the complement of A, which is anything in U, in the universal set, but take away from it all the elements that are in A. Here is the Venn diagram for the complement of B, which means anything in the universal set, but take away from it all the elements that are in B. Therefore, the complement of A intersection the complement of B is we look at the area covered in orange in here that is common to the area covered in orange in the complement of B. We can see the both area that this and this have in common is this. As you can see, this orange area and the orange area here are the same. Therefore, we can say that the complement of A union B is equal to the complement of A intersection the complement of B. Now, let's try to prove the second law of De Morgan's law, the complement of A intersection B is equal to the complement of A union the complement of B. First, let's find the Venn diagram for the intersection of A and B, that's where it is. This area here in orange, that's the element that they have in common. , therefore, if this is A intersection B, so the complement of A intersection B will be anything in the universal set but not this area here that A and B have in common. Now, let's look at the other thing, the complement of A on it's own, the complement of B in its own, and if we join this, the complement of A union the complement of B will be just these areas here. Which as you can see, the complement of A union the complement of B colored area in orange here, represented by this orange area, is exactly the same area here that represents the complement of A intersection B. By doing that, we can deduce that those two sets are similar or they are equivalent. As you have seen now, we looked at De Morgan's law, and we looked at proving that they're correct using membership table, then we proved that they are correct using the Venn diagram. Now let's look at an example here that show us those De Morgan's law. I have a set U, the universal set which has got the element 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, and I have two subsets, A and B, of the set U. A contains 1, 2, 3, 4, and B contains 4, 5, 6, 7. A union B, we just join them together, join those two sets together, so A union B has 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, A intersection B is only the element that two sets have in common, which is just 4. The complement of A union B is the universal set take away from it all those element that are in A and in B, so we end up just with 8 and 9, that's the complement of A union B. The complement of the intersection of A and B is just the universal set take away from it 4, because 4 is the only element of A intersection B. Then therefore, we'll end up with the complement of A intersection B has got the element 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 4. In another way, all the elements here minus 4, because 4 is in the intersection. The complement of A is any element in the universal set which is not in A, which is 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. The complement of B is any element in the universal set U which is not in B, which is 1, 2, 3, 8, and 9. Now, let's look. The complement of A intersection the complement of B, which is the intersection this and this, what they have in common and they have 8 and 9, which is exactly the complement of A union B. Also the complement of A union the complement of B, which is if we join those two together, we'll have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, which is exactly the complement of A intersection B. This is just an example to show you De Morgan's law that they are correct. We proved them using the membership table, we proved them using the Venn diagram, now we just give an example with the set with some element to show how De Morgan's law works. We looked at union, intersection, set difference, symmetric difference, we looked at membership table, we also looked at the Venn diagram, we looked at how to prove properties using membership table and using Venn diagram, now we'll look at some set identities. The first set that we will be using is commutativity. Commutativity means is the order doesn't matter. We say that the union is commutative because A union B is the same as B union A, so the order of A and B does not matter. The same thing as the intersection is commutative because A intersection B is equal to the same thing as B intersection A. The same thing for the symmetric difference, A symmetric difference B is equal to the symmetric difference of B and A. The order does not matter. We say that those relations, union, intersection, and symmetric difference are commutative relations. However, A minus B is different from B minus A. When you change the order, you get a different set, and we say that the set difference is not commutative. Then we also looked at another relation which is associativity. Associativity is related to grouping. If I group A union B, I work out the result of A union B first, then a union, the result to C, I will get exactly the same result if I group C and B, work out the result of C union B, then union the result to A. The grouping does not matter. Group A and B then union C is the same thing as A union bracket C union B. In associativity, you need three element and one operation. The same thing here, bracket A intersection B intersection C is the same thing as A intersection bracket B intersection C. The same thing stands for the symmetric difference. We say that the union, the intersection, the symmetric difference are associative operations. Then we looked at distributivity. When you talk about distributivity, we talk about two operations and three elements, elements in the set theory sets. We've got three sets, A, B,and C, and we've got two operations, the union and the intersection. We say that the union is distributive over the intersection as A union bracket B intersection C is exactly the same thing as A union B intersection A union C. Similarly, we say that the intersection is distributive over the union as A intersection bracket B union C is equal to A intersection B union A intersection C. Now, let's look at proving the distributive law of the intersection over the union, and the union over the intersection using membership table. Because we have three sets, then we will have eight possible cases. Elements are not in three of them, are only in C, are only in B, only in A and B. If you look at here, and this is the membership table for A union B intersection C, and this is the membership table for A union B intersection A union C, and if you look at this, you see that this column is exactly the same as this column, therefore, A union B intersection C is equal to A union B intersection A union C. One thing of proving things is using the membership table. Similarly, we can look to show that the intersection is distributive over the union. We find the membership table of A intersection B union C, then the membership table of A intersection B union A intersection C. If you look at this column here, is similarly to this column, therefore, those two sets are similar or are the same or are equivalent. Now, let's look at the set difference. We want to prove that A minus B, this is a difference identity, is A minus B is equal to A intersection the complement of B. Let's prove it. This is A, this is B, this is the complement of B, by the way, there's a bar here but it's very small, you can see it, here's A intersection the complement of B. A intersection complement of B, 0 and 1 is 0, 0 and 0 is 0, 1 and 1 is 1, 1 and 0 is 0, so this is A intersection the complement of B, and this is the membership table for A minus B, which is as well, they give us 0, 0, 1, 0. We can see that this column and this column are the same, therefore, A minus B is exactly the same as A intersection the complement of B. This is called the set difference identity, which we will use later on an example to prove things. Suppose you want to prove that A minus B bracket A minus B close bracket minus B is equal to A, we want to prove this. I can use the set difference rules. Sorry, what did I want to prove? A union B minus B. I want to prove that A minus A is equal to A minus B. That's what I want to prove. I'll start with this and I'll do the set difference rule. I replace this minus B by intersection the complement of B, then I use the distributive law. A union B intersection the complement of B, that will give me A intersection the complement of B union B intersection the complement of B, which is the distributive law. Then I can take B intersection the complement of B, we know that this is always an empty set. What we have here is A intersection the complement of B union the empty set, which is equal to A intersection the complement of B, which is using the set difference, which is exactly A minus B. We can use those set identities to prove that two sets are either equal or they are different. So far, we use the membership table, we use the Venn diagram, then we can also use the set identities. We use the set difference here rule, we use distributive rule here, and we use again, the complement rule, then we used here the set difference rule again. We prove this using set identities, we can also prove it using a membership table. We work out the membership table for this, we find this column, and we record the membership table of A minus B, and we find this column, and you can see that they're both the same. Therefore, this set is equal to this set. Or we can use a Venn diagram. Here is the Venn diagram for A union B minus B and here is the Venn diagram for A minus B. As you can see, both Venn diagrams are the same. The area colored in orange is the same in both of them, therefore, those two sets are equal or are equivalent. Before I move to the powerset, all I want you to retain from this is the concept of a set, the set operations, the set identities that we looked at, and also what you need to know is how to prove that two sets are similar, either using the set identities or using the membership table or using the Venn diagram. Three ways of proof that we looked at; set identities, membership table, or Venn diagram. If you have a question which specify use Venn diagram to prove that those two sets are equal, then you have to use Venn diagram. If you have a question that is open, say, prove that those two sets are the same, then you have three options, you can either use the membership table, you can use Venn diagram, or you can use the set identities. Let's look at another concept, then [inaudible], then I'll start taking question and answer all your questions. Well, the concept that we looked at again, is the concept of a powerset of a set. Given a set S, the powerset of S, we'll write P of S, is the set containing all the subset of the set S. It's a bit complicated but with an example, it gets clearer. Let's look at this set here. Set S, it has got three elements 1, 2, and 3. What are all the subsets of this set here? An empty set is a subset of any set, so empty set is a subset. A set containing 1 is also a subset of S, a set containing 2 on its own is also a subset, a set containing 3 on its own is also a subset of S, a set containing 1 and 2, set containing 1 and 3, set containing 2 and 3, and set containing 1, 2, 3 because any set is a subset of itself. They are the only subsets of this set S. Therefore, the powerset of S is the set which have as elements, all those subsets. The empty set is a subset of S, therefore, it's an element of the powerset of S. The set containing 1 on its own is a subset of S, therefore, it is an element of a powerset of S. The set containing 2 is a subset of S, therefore, it is an element of the powerset. All the element of a powerset of S are the subsets of S. Now, we also looked at one concept which is the cardinality of a set. The cardinality of a set is just the number of element of a set. You take a set, try to find its cardinality, and just count how many element that set has got. Now we can look at this relation that links the cardinality of the powerset of S to the cardinality of S. The cardinality, the number of element in a powerset of S is equal to 2 to the power the number of element in S. That's it. Let's look at this example and make this clearer. Here is S, has got three element 1, 2, 3, so its cardinality is 3. Here is the powerset, let's count how many element 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, so the number of elements in the powerset is 8, which is equal to 2^3, which is 2 to the power of the cardinality of S because 3 is the cardinality of S. If I know the number of element in a set, then I can find out the number of element in the powerset of a set S. Let's just give an example here. :51 If I have a set, the cardinality of a set has got n elements. A set S has got n element, then the powerset of S, it's cardinality has got 2^n. If the cardinality of S has got 4, then the powerset of S has got 2^4 which is 16 elements. For example, if I take set S has got 10 elements, :29 its cardinality, then its powerset has got 2^10 which is 1,024 element. That's the relation that links the number of element of a set to the number of elements of its powerset. :55 That ends this example. Then I can just do a few things here, then I can start taking examples. :10 Let's say I have got a set S. S and its powerset. :24 S is a subset of itself. Therefore, S is an element of a powerset. :34 If S is an element of the powerset of S as S is a subset of S. Goes to the empty set. Empty set is also a subset of S. Empty set is a subset of any set. Therefore, empty set is an element of a powerset of S. Because empty set is a subset of all set, we can also say, this is special for the empty set, is also a subset of a powerset. The empty set is very special set, is an element of a powerset and it's also a subset of a powerset of S. I'll just give you an example. If I've got S, has got, let's say, 1, 2, we can see that its powerset has got empty set, set containing 1, set containing 2, set containing 1 and 2. That is powerset. We can see that how many elements here? 1, 2, 3, 4. How many elements here? 1, 2. The cardinality of S is equal to 2, the cardinality of a power S is equal to 2^2, which is 4, you have to count them 1, 2, 3, 4. We also can see that S, this is S, S is an element of a powerset of S. We can also see that the empty set is an element of a powerset of S. As the empty set is a subset of any set, we can say that the empty set is also a subset of a powerset of S. I think we get to the end of Topic 1. As a summary, we look at some set operations, we look at some set identities, we look at how to prove that two sets are equivalent using the membership table, we also looked at how to prove that two sets are different using the Venn diagram, we also looked at how to prove that two sets are the same using set identities, and finally, we looked at the concept of a powerset, and we looked at the relation that links sets and its powersets, and also we looked at the relation that links the number of element of a set to the number of elements of its corresponding powerset. What I'll do now is I will stop the recording and I will start taking any question that you might have and I'll do my best to answer them. :15 If you have any question, I'll be happy to answer it. For now, I'll stop the recording and will start answering questions. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 1.2 Set representation and manipulation Lesson 1.3 Extra resources Reading: Reading Sets problem sheet .

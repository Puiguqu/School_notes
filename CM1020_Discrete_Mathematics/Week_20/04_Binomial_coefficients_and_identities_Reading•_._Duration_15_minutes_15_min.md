Binomial coefficients represent the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements without regard to order. They are defined as: (k n) = k!(n-k)! / n!. This definition is essential in combinatorics and algebra, with numerous applications in probability, statistics, and algebra.

The binomial coefficient has two properties: symmetry and Pascal's rule. Symmetry states that (k n) = (n-k n), reflecting the equivalence of choosing k elements from n elements versus leaving out n-k elements. Pascal's rule states that (k n) = (k-1 n-1) + (k n-1), derived from considering whether a particular element is included in the subset or not.

The binomial theorem describes the expansion of a binomial raised to any positive integer power: (x+y)^n = ∑[k=0,n] (k n)x^(n-k)y^k. This theorem expresses the coefficients in the expansion as binomial coefficients.

Binomial coefficients are central to combinatorics and algebra, providing tools for counting, probability, and algebraic manipulations. The properties of binomial coefficients, including symmetry and Pascal's rule, make them a fundamental concept in mathematics.

In conclusion, binomial coefficients and their identities are essential for solving problems in combinatorics and algebra, with numerous applications across various fields of study. Understanding the definition, properties, and identities of binomial coefficients is crucial for working in these areas.

Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key In this lecture, we will discuss generalist permutations and combinations. First, we will introduce permutations with and without repetitions. Then we will move on to look at combinations with and without repetitions. Finally, we will summarize the formula discussed in the lecture and consider how each of them can be applied in practice. We first look at permutations with repetitions, the number of r-permutations of a set with n objects with reputation allowed is n to the power of r. Now let's look at how we can prove this. As repetition is permitted, this means that for each object selection we will have n possibilities to choose from. This means that we have n different possibilities to select from the first object and n different possibilities to select from the second object, and n different possibilities to select from the third object and so on. Similarly, we have n different objects available for our last selection. By the product rule, we multiply n by itself at times. Hence the number of r-permutation of a set with n element is just n to the power of r. Let's consider the following example, how many strings of length r can be formed if we are using only uppercase letters in the English alphabet? Now, let's try to solve this problem. There are 26 uppercase letters in the English alphabet. We want to find the number of strength of length r that can be formed from these 26 letters. Clearly, this is just the number of r-permutations with the repetition of a set containing 26 elements. Therefore, the number of such strings is just 26 to the power of r. In the case of permutations without repetition we reduce the number of available choices each time by one. In other words, there are n possibilities for the first choice n-1 possibilities for the second choice, n-2 possibilities for the third choice, and finally n-r+1 possibilities for the last selection. Therefore the number of r-permutations of a set of n objects in this case is just n times N minus one times n minus two and so on that the last time which is n minus r plus one. Which is just equal to n factorial over n minus r factorial. Let's consider the following example, are taking part in a running competition. How many different ways can the first and the second place be awarded in this case? Clearly, this problem can be reduced to find in the number of two permutations with no repetition of a set of 10 runners. Therefore, the number of different ways in which the first and second place can be awarded can be worked out as follow. 10 factorial over 10-2 factorial which is equal to 10 factorial over 8 factorial, which is equal to 90. In the case of combinations with repetition, the number of ways in which K object can be selected from any categories of objects with repetition permitted can be calculated us k plus n -1, choose K. Which is a culture K plus and -1 factorial over K factorial times and -1 factorial. This is also the total number of ways to put K identical balls into n distant boxes. It is also the total number of functions from a set of K identical elements to a set of an distant element. Now let's consider an example, let's find all multi sets of size three from the set containing 1, 2, 3 and 4 using bars on courses. Think of the values 1, 2, 3, 4 as four categories, we will dinner out each multi set of size three by placing three courses in the various category. For instance, the multi set 1, 1, 3 is represented by a cross cross bar bar cross and bar. This counting problem can be modeled as distributing the three courses amounts. The 3+ 4 -1 positions, with the remaining positions being occupied by bars. Thus the number of multi set of size day is just six, choose three, which is equal to six factorial over three factorial Times three factorial, which is equal to 20 in this case. Now let's take a look, the case of combinations without repetition. The number of ways in which k objects can be selected from any categories of objects with the repetition. Not permitted, can be calculated as just n choose K which is equal to n factorial over K factorial times n minus k factorial. This counting problem is the same as determining the number of ways of putting k identical balls into n distinct boxes where each box receives at most one ball, it is also The same as determining the number of 1-1 functions from a set of k identical elements into a set of any distant elements. Finally, it is also the number of k element subsets of an N element set. So far, we have encountered four different ways of choosing K objects from a set with n elements. The order in which the choices are made may or may not matter and the repetition may or may not be permitted. The table shown here summarizes the formula in each case. In the case of permutations where the other matters, the number of k permutations. If repetition is not allowed is equal to n factorial over n minus k factorial and is equal to and to the part of k if repetition is allowed. In the case of combinations where the order doesn't matter, the number of k combinations if repetitions are not permitted is equal to n factorial over K factorial times and minus k factorial. Whereas in the case where repetitions are allowed, it is equal to que plus n -1 factorial over K factorial times, n -1 factorial. Consider the following example, John is a chair of a committee, in how many ways can a committee of three be chosen from 10 people. Given that John must be one of the people selected. Now let's try to solve this problem, since John is already chosen, we need to choose another two out of nine people in choosing a community, the other doesn't matter. So, we need to apply the combination without repetition formula as follow. So, this is equivalent as just choosing chosen 2 from 9, which is equal to nine factorial over two factorial times 9 -2 factorial, which is equal to 36. In this lecture, we discussed generalist permutations and combinations. We began by looking permutations with and without repetitions. Then we moved on to look at combinations with and without repetitions. Finally, we summarized the formula covered in the lecture and considered some example of how each of them can be applied in practice. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 10.2 Further techniques Video: Video Binomial coefficients and identities .

Set Theory: Definition of sets, elements, subsets, and power sets Understanding cardinality Set operations: union, intersection, difference, complement Constructing sets through set-builder notation Identification and application of set identities Propositional Logic: Representation of propositions and determination of truth values Performing logical operations: conjunction, disjunction, implication, etc. Identification of logical equivalences Distinguishing between statements and propositions Understanding and use rules of inference in propositional logic Predicate Logic: Understanding the difference between a proposition and a predicate Understanding and use of quantifiers Interpretation of universal discourse, signs and symbols Understanding and use logical connectives. Understanding and use rules of inference Understanding and use Nested Quantifiers Functions and Relations: Understanding function types: injective, surjective, bijective Determining whether function is one-to-one or onto Finding the inverse of a function Plotting functions on graph Understanding relations and their types Interpretation of digraphs Determination of equivalence classes Combinations and Permutations: Understanding principles of permutations and combinations Application of principles to determine possible outcomes of events Graph Theory: Understanding concepts related to Eulerian cycles/paths, Hamiltonian cycles/paths Identification and illustration of such paths Understanding properties of graphs Interpretation of degree sequences Boolean Algebra: Understanding Boolean expressions.

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

A function is a rule that relates one quantity to another, where each input maps to exactly one output. Functions are a fundamental concept in computer programming and are used extensively in writing programs. A plant's growth, for example, depends on factors such as sunlight and rainfall, while a runner's speed depends on the time taken to run a distance. Voltage is also dependent on resistance and electric current.

In mathematics, functions are used to model relationships between variables. The concept of a function is central to computer programming and most programs consist of functions that work together to achieve a goal. To be considered a valid function, it must satisfy certain properties, including being one-to-one (injective) or onto (surjective).

Injective functions map each input to exactly one output, while surjective functions ensure every output has at least one corresponding input. Functions can also be categorized as even or odd based on their behavior under symmetry operations.

In this topic, we will introduce functions and examine various properties, including plotting functions, injective and surjective functions, and more. We will explore how functions are used in computer programming and review essential reading material. The goal of this topic is to provide a comprehensive understanding of functions and their applications in mathematics and computer science.

Overall, functions play a crucial role in modeling relationships between variables and are an essential tool for problem-solving in both mathematics and computer programming.

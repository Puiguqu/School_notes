Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

A function is a relation between a set of inputs (called the domain) and a set of outputs (called the co-domain). The output for each input is unique. A function can be represented as f(x), where x is an element of the domain and f(x) is an element of the co-domain.

The range of a function is the subset of the co-domain that contains all possible outputs of the function. To find the range, we need to determine the set of values that the output takes for each input.

To find the pre-image of an element in the co-domain, we need to find the input that produces that output. In other words, we need to solve the equation f(x) = y for x.

A function can be injective (one-to-one), meaning that no two different inputs produce the same output. A function can also be surjective (onto), meaning that every element in the co-domain has a corresponding input in the domain.

For example, consider the function f: Z -> Z defined by f(x) = |x|. The domain of this function is all integers, and the range is all non-negative integers. To find the pre-image of 1, we need to solve |x| = 1 for x, which gives us x = -1 or x = 1.

In summary, a function is a relation between two sets that assigns each element of one set to exactly one element of another set. The range of a function is the subset of the co-domain that contains all possible outputs, and the pre-image of an element in the co-domain is the input that produces that output.

Here are some key points to take away from this lesson:

* Definition of a function
* Finding the domain, co-domain, and range of a function
* Pre-images of elements in the co-domain
* Injective and surjective functions

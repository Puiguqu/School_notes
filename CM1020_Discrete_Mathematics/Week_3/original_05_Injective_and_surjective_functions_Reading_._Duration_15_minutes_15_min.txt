Introduction to injective and surjective functions Functions, also known as mappings or transformations, are fundamental concepts in mathematics. They describe relationships between sets. Two important types of functions are injective and surjective functions. Understanding these types of functions is crucial for studying various areas of mathematics, including algebra, calculus and discrete mathematics. Injective functions An injective function (or one-to-one function) is a function in which every element of the codomain is mapped by at most one element of the domain. In other words, no two different elements in the domain map to the same element in the codomain. Definition A function f:A→B is injective if f(a 1 )=f(a 2 ) implies a 1 =a 2 for all a 1 ,a 2 ∈A. Graphical representation of a function In a graphical representation of a function, if every horizontal line intersects the graph of the function at most once, the function is injective. Image description: This figure shows the graphs for the representation of two functions: f=+1 on the left-side and g=x 2 on the right-side. The function $f$ is an increasing straight line and is injective as all horizontal lines meet the curve of f at one point only. The function curve of the function g is decreasing for negative numbers and increasing for positive numbers. The graph shows that some horizontal lines intersect with the graph of $g$ in more than one point. Therefore, the function g is not injective. Example of an injective function Consider the function f:{1,2,3}→{a,b,c,d} defined by f(1)=a, f(2)=b, f(3)=c. This function is injective because different elements in the domain map to different elements in the codomain. Example of a non-injective function The function g:{1,2,3}→{a,b,c} defined by g(1)=a, g(2)=a, g(3)=b is not injective because both 1 and 2 map to the same element a in the codomain. Surjective functions A surjective function (or onto function) is a function in which every element of the codomain is mapped by at least one element of the domain. In other words, the function covers the entire codomain. Definition A function f:A→B is surjective if for every b∈B, there exists at least one a∈A such that f(a)=b. Graphical representation In a graphical representation of a function, if every horizontal line intersects the graph of the function at least once, the function is surjective. Image description: This figure shows the graphs for the representation of two functions: f=+1 on the left-side and g=x 2 on the right-side. The function f is an increasing straight line and is surjective as all horizontal lines meet the curve of f at at lest one point. The function curve of the function g is decreasing for negative numbers and increasing for positive numbers. The graphs show that all horizontal lines for which y<0 don't intersect with the graph of g at any point. Therefore, the function g is not surjective. Example of a surjective function Consider the function f:{1,2,3}→{a,b,c} defined by f(1)=a, f(2)=b, f(3)=c. This function is surjective because every element in the codomain {a,b,c} is mapped by some element in the domain. Example of a non-surjective function The function g:{1,2}→{a,b,c} defined by g(1)=a, g(2)=b is not surjective because c in the codomain is not mapped by any element in the domain. Combining injective and surjective functions A function can be both injective and surjective. Such functions are called bijective functions (or one-to-one correspondences). Bijective functions A function f:A→B is bijective if it is both injective and surjective. This means every element of the codomain is mapped by exactly one element of the domain. Example Consider the function $ f: \{1, 2, 3\} \to \{a, b, c\} $ defined by $ f(1) = a $, $ f(2) = b $, $f(3) = c $. This function is bijective because it is both injective and surjective. Summary Injective functions (one-to-one): No two different elements in the domain map to the same element in the codomain. Every element in the codomain is mapped by at most one element in the domain. Surjective functions (onto): Every element in the codomain is mapped by at least one element in the domain. Bijective functions (one-to-one correspondence): A function that is both injective and surjective. Every element in the codomain is mapped by exactly one element in the domain.

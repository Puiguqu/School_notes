There is no specific problem to solve in the provided transcript, as it appears to be a lecture on functions, including what constitutes an invertible function, how to find the inverse of a function, and the relationship between a graph of a function and its inverse.

However, if you'd like to practice solving problems related to functions based on this lecture, I can provide some examples. Here are a few:

1. Determine whether the following functions are invertible:
a) f(x) = x^2
b) g(x) = 3x - 2
c) h(x) = x + 1

If you're unsure how to determine if a function is invertible, let me know and I can explain the criteria.

2. Find the inverse of each of the following functions:
a) f(x) = 2x + 1
b) g(x) = x^3 - 2
c) h(x) = (x-2)^2

If you'd like help with these problems or need further clarification on any concept, feel free to ask!

3. Graph the inverse of each of the following functions:
a) f(x) = x^2 + 1
b) g(x) = 3x - 2
c) h(x) = x - 2

Remember that the graph of a function and its inverse are symmetric with respect to the line y = x.

Let me know if you'd like help with these problems or have any specific questions about functions!

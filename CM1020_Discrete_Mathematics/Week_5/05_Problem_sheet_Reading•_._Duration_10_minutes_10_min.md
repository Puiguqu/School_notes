# Problem sheet Reading• . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/supplement/rnD1o/problem-sheet)

Here are the 15 sentences summarizing the text, focusing on key concepts and findings:

1. Propositions are statements that are either true or false, such as "2+2=4" or "It is hot".
2. The statement "2+2=5" is not a proposition because it is false.
3. The statement "x+y>0" is not a proposition because it depends on the values of x and y.
4. The statement "This coffee is strong" is a proposition, even though its truth value may vary depending on individual opinions.
5. In propositional logic, statements can be combined using logical operators such as ∧ (and), ∨ (or), ¬ (not), etc.
6. The listing method is used to specify the truth sets corresponding to each of the following statements: ¬q p∧¬q ¬p∨q
7. The truth table for two propositions p and q shows the truth values of p∨q, ¬p∨¬q, p∧q, and ¬(p∧q).
8. The logical statement "It is sunny or it is raining but not both" can be represented symbolically as s∨r∧¬(s∩r).
9. The logical statement "It is hot only if it is sunny" can be represented symbolically as h→s.
10. Propositional logic allows us to analyze and reason about statements using logical operators and rules.
11. Compound propositions are formed by combining simple propositions with logical operators.
12. Truth tables and truth sets are used to determine the truth values of compound propositions.
13. The truth table for three propositions h, s, and r shows the truth values of h∨s∧¬(h∩s), h→s, and h→(s∧¬r).
14. Logical statements can be analyzed using truth tables and logical operators to determine their truth values.
15. Propositional logic provides a formal system for analyzing and reasoning about statements using logical operators and rules.

Note that I have preserved all key information, formulae, and technical details from the original text, focusing on the most important concepts and findings in propositional logic.

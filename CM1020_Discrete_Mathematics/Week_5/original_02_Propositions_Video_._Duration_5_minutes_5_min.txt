Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key In this lecture, we will talk about propositions. We will start by defining what a proposition is in a mathematical context, then we will explain how propositional variables help to simplify notations. In mathematics, a proposition is a declarative sentence, that is either true or false, but not both. A proposition is the most basic elements of logic. In other words, propositions are the blocks we use to build our reasoning and logical statements. Now, let's write down some propositions, and examine whether they are true or false. For instance, let's consider the statement, London is the capital of United Kingdom. We know that this is true, so this is considered to be a proposition, and precisely, a true proposition. In the same way, the statement, 1 plus 1 equals 2 is a proposition, and is precisely a true proposition. We can say the same about the statement, 2 is less than 3. This is also a proposition, and is precisely a true proposition. Now, let's consider some different kinds of statements, for instance, Madrid is the capital of France. This is still a proposition as its statement known to be false. In English, it can be uncomfortable to write a false statements, but mathematically, it's considered to be a proposition. In the same way, the statement, 3 is less than 2 is also a proposition and is precisely a false proposition. Finally, the statement 10 is an odd number, is also a proposition, and is also a false proposition. Now, let's take a look at some examples that are not propositions. For instance, consider this example, x plus 1 equals 2. We actually don't know, if it's true or false because we don't know what x is. Therefore, this sentence is not considered to be a proposition. In a similar way, the sentence x plus y equal z is not a proposition, because we don't know the values of x, y and z. However, we should note that both of these two sentences can be turned into a proposition, if we give values to the variables. Consider a different example, the sentence, what time is it? What time is it, is not a proposition, because it's not a declarative sentence and doesn't hold any true or false meaning. In the same way, the sentence, read this carefully, is not a declarative sentence, which means it can't be considered to be a proposition. The sentence, this coffee is strong, has a vague meaning as the adjective strong has relative meaning depending on the person, which means it can't be considered to be a proposition. To avoid writing long and repetitive propositions, we use propositional variables. A propositional variable is typically a letter such as p, q, r. For instance, we can denote the propositions that we saw earlier by using the propositional variables, p, q, r, s as follows: p is the proposition, London is the capital of the United Kingdom; q is the proposition, 1 plus 1 equals 2; r is the proposition, 2 is less than 3, and s is the proposition, 1 plus 0 equals 1. In this lecture, we talked about propositions which are the basic elements of logic. We started by defining what a proposition is in a mathematical context. We also looked at some examples of sentences that are considered to be propositions, and others that are not. Finally, we saw how propositional variables can help to simplify notations. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Video: Video Introduction to propositional logic .

## VIDEO TRANSCRIPT ## You may navigate through the transcript using tab. To save a note for a section of text press CTRL + S. To expand your selection you may use CTRL + arrow key. You may contract your selection using shift + CTRL + arrow key. For screen readers that are incompatible with using arrow keys for shortcuts, you can replace them with the H J K L keys. Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key This is the first exercise on propositional logic. Let l denote one of the letters in the word software. The following propositions relate to l. P states, that l is a vow, and q states that l comes after the letter K in the alphabet. Use the listing method to specify the truth set corresponding to each of the following statements, note q. p and note q note p or q. Let's look at the first one, not q. So q is the statement that l comes after the letter k in the alphabet and l remember is one of the letters in the word software. If we look at the letters in the word software, we see that q comprises O, S, t, r and w. So these are the letters in software that come after the letter K in the alphabet. Then note Q, are the letters in the word software that come before the letter K in the alphabet and these are a, e and f. The second part asks, what is p on did note q. We already found note q in the last part. Proposition p is that l is a vowel. And remember, l is one of the letters in the word software. So what we want to find are the vowels in the word software. So p is the set a, e, and o. Now what we want to find is p and note q. So what are the letters that are both in the set p and in the set, note q? These are a and e. Finally, we want to find the truth set corresponding to note p or q. We have found p to be the vowels in the word software. So note p are the continents in the word software. Note p is the set s, f, t, w and r. We already have q from earlier. So we want to find all of the letters that are either in the set, not p or in the set q. So note p or q are the letters s, f, t, w, r and o. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 3.2 Applications Lesson 3.3 Extra resources Reading: Reading Propositional logic problem sheet .

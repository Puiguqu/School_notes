Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key We now come to the second exercise in propositional logic. Let p and q be two propositions. Construct a truth table to show the truth value of each of the following logical statements: p or q, not p or not q, p and q, not p and q. What can we say about the following two statements, not p or not q and not p and q? Let's start by constructing the truth table. If we have n propositions, the truth table needs to have at least n columns and two to the n rows. This is so that we can show all the possible combinations of the n propositions. We have two propositions, so we have two columns for p and q to begin with. Then we have 2_n or four rows. The first column gives all the values of p 0, 0, 1, 1. The second column is the values of q 0, 1, 0, 1. So the four possible combinations of p and q are 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1. Now in order to answer the question, we need to add some extra columns. Let's begin by constructing the third column for not p. This is just the opposite of the first column p. The first column is 0, 0, 1, 1 for p, so not p is 1, 1, 0, 0. Similarly, the forth column for not q is the opposite of the second column for q. If q is 0, 1, 0, 1, not q is 1, 0, 1, 0. The first logical statement we're asked to look at is p or q. In this case, e the proposition p or proposition q is true for this to be true. As we see, the only row in which neither p nor q is one is the first row. In all of the other rows, either p or q is one. So p or q is 0, 1, 1, 1. The six column looks at p and q. In this case, for this to be one, we need both p and q to be one. This is only true for the last row, so p and q in this case is 0, 0, 0,1. In the next column, let's look at not p and q. This is simply the opposite of the previous column, p and q. If p and q is 0, 0, 0, 1, not p and q is 1, 1, 1, 0. The final logical statement we're asked to look at is, not p or not q. This is when either not p or not q is true. Looking at the third and fourth columns, the only row in which not p and not q are both zero, is the fourth row. So not p or not q is 1, 1, 1, 0. Finally, we asked, what can we say about the two statements, not p or not q and not p and q? Looking at the last two columns of our truth table, we see that not p and q and not p or not q are exactly the same. They are both 1, 1, 1, 0; hence, not p and q, and not p or not q are equivalent statements, and this is just DeMorgan's law. In fact, DeMorgan's second statement can also be shown in the same way. The second statement is, as you remember, not p or q is equal to not p and not q. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 3.2 Applications Lesson 3.3 Extra resources Reading: Reading Propositional logic problem sheet .

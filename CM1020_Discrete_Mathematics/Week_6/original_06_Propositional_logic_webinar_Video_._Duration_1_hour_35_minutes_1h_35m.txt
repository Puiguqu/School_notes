Okay, so in today's session I will give you a just like a summary of what you need to know from the topic of Propositional Logic. So we'll start by just a definition of a proposition, what propositional are variable, truth the table and truth sets. Then we'll talk a little bit about compound proposition, we'll talk about the AND, the OR, the XOR, we will also talked about the implication and equivalence. And we go to some exercises that explore all proposition, all laws of propositional logic. So as you know, a proposition is a declarative sentence that is either true or false, but not both, yeah. That's what we call a proposition, is something that is either true or false, but is not both, okay? So, a proposition is the most basic element of logic, yeah? Let's look at some examples, along them is the capital of the United Kingdom, this is true, it is a proposition. 1+ 1 = 2, it's true, it is a proposition. 2 is less than 3, it is also true, so it is a proposition. Madrid is the capital of France, this is false, it is a proposition. 3 is less than 2, it's false, it is also a proposition. 10 is an odd number, it's false and it is also a proposition. However, if I take like x + 1 = 2, this is not a proposition. It's not a proposition because if x = 1, then it's true, if x = 2, then it's false. So we can't say if it is true or false, it depends on the value of x, so this is not a proposition. Same thing, we have three variables x + y = z is not a proposition, or what time is it is not a proposition or read this carefully, this is not a proposition. Okay, so this coffee is strong, again this is not a proposition. This is, some might find it strong and some might find it a weak or not strong. So therefore, it's not a proposition because a proposition can be either true all the time or false all the time, okay? So to avoid on writing long repetitive proposition we use propositional variables, we refer to a propositions using our case can access our last p, q, r in lower case, that's how we refer to proposition. For example, proposition p may be London is the capital of the United Kingdom, proposition q may be 1 + 1 = 2, proposition r means 2 is less than 3, and proposition s means 1 + 0 = 1, yeah? So it's just how we refer to proposition. Now that we know what a proposition is, now we will talk to be truth table and the truth set of a proposition. So it's loot table is a tabular representation of all the possible combination of its of constituent variables. So for example, here are two propositions here p and q. So there is p here, so p is FALSE, p FALSE, p FALSE, p TRUE, q FALSE and TRUE, TRUE. So we have four possible combinations because we have two propositions. So the number of possible combinations are 2 to the power of the number of propositions in this case 2 to the power of 2. Which we'll have 4 possible combinations, FALSE FALSE, FALSE TRUE, TRUE FALSE, TRUE TRUE, okay? So once we have for example n propositions, then our truth table will have 2 to the power of n rows, yeah, possible combinations. In this case, we have three proposition p q and r than we have 2 to the power of 3, 3 possible combination. If you count how many year 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 8 is 2 to the power of 3, which is the number of propositional variables used in this truth table, okay? So, this is what the definition of a truth table, but we will use the true table later on on some exercises and you see how we use it. Or how it can be used to show or to prove that two propositions are equivalent. So the truth set, let p be a proposition, p with lowercase, proposition on a set S. So the truth set of p is the set of elements for which p is true, is the set of elements that makes the proposition p is true. And we use a capital letter to refer to the truth set of a proposition. For example, if we have a proposition with lowercase p, it truth set is noted as capital P. And we can look at some examples that will show what we mean with truth set. Now, let's look at this set here S, we have a set S which have elements 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, to 10 and p and q are two propositions, yeah? That say something about those elements in the set S here, yeah, they say they are concerning an integer in this set S here. So p means n is even, where n is one of those elements in the set S, q means n is odd where n is one of the elements in the set. So, the truth set of p written as P is what are the elements that makes P truth here. P means n is even so 2 is an even number, 4 is an even number, 6 is and even number, 8 is an even number, and 10 is an even number. Therefore the truth set of P is the set containing all the even numbers that are in S, which are 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. The truth set of q, however, contains only the odd numbers, which are 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. So if we take an element in Q, then q is true, if we take an element in P, then that makes p as true, yeah? Yes, Abi, you could say that, but it's a little bit complicated, is that the truth set is the elements that makes the proposition true, yeah? For example, if I take this element 3 here is not on the truth set of P, because 3 is an odd number, wherever P, yeah, and the meaning of P means that number has to be even. Did I answer your question, Abi? So the truth set is just the set of elements that makes that proposition true. That's good, okay, now that we know what is a proposition, we know what is a true table, we know what is a true set of a proposition. We can now go and talk about compound propositions. So compound propositions are statements built by combining multiple propositions using certain rules, yeah? And we will look up different way of combined propositions. For example, the negation, let p be a proposition, the negation of p is a written as not p, yeah? Can we read does not p and we use this symbol here for not p, it is not the case that p is the negation of p. For example, if P said n is an even number, then not p will mean n is not an even number, yeah, the negation of a number. So, the truth table of p are not p as follows. For example, if i say, let's do this example, p : *John's program is written in Python." That's the meaning, not p: "John's program is not written in Python." yeah, that's the negation of p. And a truth table is this, whenever p is false then not p is true, if p is true then not p is false. That is just the negation of a proposition, so we know what the negation of a proposition. Now we talk about conjunction which is the AND operator. So let p and q be true propositions, the conjunction of p and p they note as we use dissemble here, yeah. The symbol p AND q, and is read as p and q. So the conjunction of p and q is only true, if and only if p is true, and q is true, so they have to be both true for the conjunction to be true, yeah, and it's false otherwise. So for example, if I say, p: means John's program is written in Python, and I say q: John's program has less than 20 lines of code. Then p and q means John's program is written in Python and it has less than 20 lines of code, okay? So then we look at the truth table of p and q, so false and false is false, false and true is false, true and false is false, true and true is true. So the AND is true only when p and q are both trues and is false otherwise, okay? is about the disjunction or the OR, yeah? The disjunction of p and q denoted as p where you dissemble V means stands for OR. And the disjunction of p OR q, disjunction are written as p or q is false only when they are both false and true otherwise. It's a bit opposite of a opposite of the AND, but when you look at the two table then they will say. So let's look at the same example, John's program is written in Python, and q means John's program has less than 20 lines of code. Some p or q means John's program is written in Python or, yeah, it's not and before we have an AND, or it has less than 20 lines of code. So and this is the truth table that you probably have already used, so false or false is false, false or true is true, true or false is true, true of true is true. So the or is false, only with both preposition p and q are false and it's true otherwise. Now we look we go to the exclusive-or operator, yeah? So what it means it's p the exclusive-or of p and q is the proposition misuse p or q, but not both, yeah? These are the ps false, and q is true or p is true And q is false and we look at the, so for example here, if we look at this example, John's program is written in Python. q means John's program has less than 20 lines of code, stop p exclusive of p and q means John's program is written in Python or he has less than 20 lines of code, but not both. Is either one or the other, it cannot be both of them, yeah, can be only one of them for the proposition to be true. And it's truth table is just as below false or false is false, false or true is true, true or false is true, true or true is false, okay? So that is just a truth table you probably have that, okay? Lee, yes you can use those laws of propositional logic that we did or if it's not specified, you can use the truth table as well. You can either use the truth table or use a series of laws of propositional to prove it. We'll probably get into that at the end of this session, and we can look at some examples, okay? Again, the precedence, yeah? Sometimes we use the bracket, but sometimes if the bracket is not there, there's too many brackets. So the not, the operator has the precedence 1, the and has precedence 2, and the or has the precedence 3. So for example, this here this p or (q and not r) can be written as p or q, and without brackets. Because what will happen is this not all will be executed first, then and q will be executed second, then next the or will be executed, yeah? But it's better to use brackets, so that's why we need it. Once there are no brackets then the not take precedence, then the and, then the or, that's what we mean with that. And most of the time, I will give you brackets just to specify. So now let's look at this example just to use a little bit of what we have seen. So, given a positive integer n, let's consider the two following proposition p and q. p means n is an even number, Yeah, p means n is an even number, q t means n is less than 10. San we need to write the logical expression of the following proposition, n is an even number and it is less than 10. So obviously n is an even number, [SOUND] and n is less than 10. The other one is n is either an even number, or it's less than 10. The other one is n is, we have to remove this either here, yeah, n is an even number or it's less than 10. The other one N is an even number or less than 10, but not both. Now let's try to have a solution to this, so, So n is an even number and it is less than 10 than is just p and q, yeah, you just p and q. The other one n remove this either here, I should have removed the either there, n is an even number or is less than 10, it just (p or q). The other one n is an even number or less than 10 but not both a just exclusive-or (p or q). And that's truth table for p and q, truth table for or, truth the table for the exclusive-or. Now we need to build a truth table for not p or (p and q). So what you do, build not p first, then do not p or (p and q), and that it's truth the table. That's a very simple exercise, so just like to build truth the table for our next question. For example, if I want to build a truth table for not p or (p and q), all I have to do build a truth table for not p first, then build a table for (p and q), then join them in the last column, that's how we do it. So now let's look at this example here, another example. Let S be the following a set which has got elements 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 to 10. Let p and q be the following proposition, p means n is even, q means n is less than 10. Now we need to find the truth set of those elements, I probably what it can do here is I, Okay now, that's fine, I'll do some example later on the iPad. So let's find the truth set of p and q, the truth set of p or q, the truth set of p the exclusive-or (p and q). So there is the truth set of p, yeah, first because p, what does p says? p says n is even, now we take all the even numbers here which are 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10, therefore the truth set of P is 2, 4, 6, 8,10. q means n is less than 5, then we just take all the elements in S which are less than 5 which are 1, 2, 3, 4, therefore, the truth set of Q is 1, 2, 3, and 4. So the truth set of P and Q the intersection of those two, yeah? What element, You have to submit it on the platform, yeah, there will be a submission link on the platform. Yeah, a typed PDF, yeah, you can type it in word I just saved it as a PDF. Okay, that's great. Okay, so this is the intersection. We just do the intersection of those which what element do they have in common, 2 and 4. Or it's just the union of those two sets, join them together, that will give you the third set of P or Q. And the exclusive or is just the element that are in P which are not in Q. Add to them the elements that are in Q which are not in P, which in this case, they will be 1, 3, 6, 8, And 10. Yes, you can, but it has to be really, really clear. Otherwise, you lose marks, yeah? Make sure your handwriting is clear, but it's preferably if you type it. Okay, now we did the and. Okay, we can. [LAUGH] Okay, now we'll talk about with sum later. Okay, let's now talk about, Tamir, can you remind me at the end of the session, then I will check it out. Okay, so let's now talk about the implication, yeah? The implication, you all, is like the conditional statement, which is if p then q, which means p implies q, yeah? This if p then q means if p is true, then q must be true. That's what it means, yeah? p is called the hypothesis, and q is called the conclusion. Whenever the hypothesis is true, then the conclusion must be true. That's what p implies q mean, okay? So let p and q, let's look at this example, let p and q be the following statement. p means John did well in discrete mathematics. q means John will do well in programming. So p implies q means if John did well in discrete mathematics, then John will do well in programming course. That means if the hypothesis is true, then the conclusion must be true. Otherwise, the implication is false. And that is the truth table. For the truth table of the implication, which a lot of student are confused, is false implies false is true. False implies true is true. True implies false is false. True implies true is true. You only need to remember when it's false. It's only false when p is true and q is false. That means that it's false only when the hypothesis is true, but the conclusion is false. Then in this case, p implies q is false, and it's true otherwise, yeah? So false implies false is true. False implies true, Is true, true implies true is true, but only one case when it's false is true implies false is a false statement. Okay, this is a correct reasoning, true implies true. This is incorrect reasoning, yeah? True implies false, this is incorrect. And both of them, when the hypothesis is false, the result is true, yeah? If the conclusion is true or false, it doesn't really matter. If the hypothesis is false, the p implies q is true. Okay, so just different expressions of p and q here. So we write p implies q, which means if p then q, we kind of write it as if p, q. It's written as p implies q. This also can be read as p only if q and also can be read q follows from p, or p is sufficient for q, or q unless not p. So all that, all expression how we can read. All those statements have the same meaning, and all means p implies q. Okay, so one things that we talked about as well in propositional logic is the converse, the contrapositive, and the inverse, yeah? [COUGH] So if I have p implies q, its converse is q implies p. Just switch p and q, switch places of p and q, yeah? So the converse of p implies q is just q implies p. The contrapositive of p implies q is not q implies not p, yeah? Contrapositive is not of the second implies not of the first. The inverse of p implies q, just leave p and q in their positions and put the negation in both of them to get the inverse, yeah? That's what the converse, the contrapositive, and the inverse means. So let's look at this example here. Let p and q be the following statement. p means it is sunny, q means John go to the park. And A be a statement p implies q. What does it mean? If it is sunny, then John goes to the park. That's the meaning of the sentence. So the converse of A, what is the converse? The converse will be q implies p. If John goes to the park, then it is sunny, yeah? We switch places of p and q. The contrapositive is if John doesn't go to the park, then it's not sunny, yeah? So what you take? You take the converse and add the negation to it. And the inverse, just leave p and q in its place, p implies q, and add the negation to the proposition. So it means if it's not sunny, then John doesn't go to the park. So that's the difference between the converse, the inverse, and the contrapositive of an implication. Let's look at this example here. We take two proposition, p and q, yeah? And they say something about an integer n. They are concerned with an integer n, yeah? p means n has one digit, q means n is less than 10. That's the meaning of those two proposition. First, let's write the following statement using a symbolic logic expression. If the integer n has one digit, then it is less than 10, this is just, p implies q, yeah? Now, we'll write the contrapositive using symbolic statement and in English. So what's the contrapositive of this? P implies q means it's not q, It's not q implies not p. That will be if, not q implies not p, that's the contrapositive. Then, it means if n is greater than or equal to 10 then n has more than one digit that it's contra positive. So now, we know what the inverse, what the contrapositive, what the convex mean. Now, we got to look at another composite which is the equivalence, yeah? When can we say that true statements are equal balance?. So we can apply that p, his is like a bi directional arrow here, yeah, the arrow is going both way. So it means this p implies q and q implies p, that's the meaning of the equivalent. So if p implies q is true and q implies p is true then p is equivalent to q, yeah. So for example here, this is p implies q and this is q implies p, and this is p implies q, and q implies p, and you can see it's true, false, false, and true, yeah. So we can say that two proposition are equivalent if it's true table of p equivalent q is all true. So we'll look at some examples in a minute. Yeah, so we just know that the equivalence means the direction is both way B is equivalent to key means p implies q and q implies p, that's the meaning of that so equivalent proposition. Let's look at some equivalent proposition for example. So let's prove that p implies w and a marked p implies q are the same, are equivalent, yeah? That we need to show that there are equivalent, so there are different ways of showing it. Then what we do is the truth table, yeah. In this case with this truth table, that's the truth table that's being which is the true, true, false, true, then we do the table of not be too to false to. Now, we can say that p implies q is equivalent to not p of q, yeah. Because if you look at the truth table of p implies q is the same as the truth table of not p or q. So therefore, those two columns are the same, therefore, p implies p is equivalent to not p or q. So you can always replace p implies q by not p or q and you get the same result. So we need to prove get some to proposition are not equivalent, for example, this is p implies q, and this is the inverse. If we look at the truth table of p implies, true, true, false, true, however, the inverse which is not p implies not q. So it's true, false, true, false, so you can see that there are not that different truth values here. This column is different from this column here, therefore, p implies q is not equivalent to not p implies not q. Same thing for the converse so we can see the P implies key, yeah? P implies q here true, true false true here we have true false to Through which is not the same. Okay, and you can see that this key implies B are not be in place. This is the. This is the contrapositive of key price B and you can see that the A statement and it's contrapositive they always have the same [INAUDIBLE] table they are equivalent. So the contra positive of a statement does not change the meaning. That the meaning stays the same, you just use the negation. And that's what contrapositive the words come from. Contra positive, contra means your negation, positive keep the same meaning. Do not change the meaning just All right, this set the amplification using the negation, but do not change the meaning. So, p implies q is always have the same meaning as not q implies not p, which is its contract positive. So let's now look at this example. We've got three proposition p. Q and r. And p means n is equal to 20. Q means n is even. R means n is positive. Yep. So let's express the following conditional statements symbolically. So this is what we have. If n is equal to 20, then n is positive. Obviously as equal to 20 is p and n is positive is r. So he says P implies R, n is positive, if n is even obviously this is you can write it if n is even then n is equal to 20, then this will be just q implies P. N is equal to 20, only if one thing you have to be very careful with only if. Only if change the direction of the [INAUDIBLE], yeah? So if you look at n is equal to 20, if n is even, it's q implies p however if I have only it becomes p implies q. So only if change the direction, okay? So So we will have a look at some examples and problem sheet that you have and discuss some examples, because we have time. So now let's look at just a summary of the laws of propositions that we have done. Okay, so laws of propositions, yeah, disjunction, conjunction. Idempotent law is p or p is p, same thing p and q is p for conjunction, commutative law is just changing the order, so p or q is the same is equivalent to q or p. The same thing for the and p and q is equivalent to q and p. Associative law is the grouping, yeah, the grouping does not affect the result. So if I group p or q first so if I do p or q, then or the result with r, then is the same thing if I group q with r then I get that result and use the operator or with p. It is same thing for the intersection, yeah, we can say the or, not the intersection, the and, the or and the and are both associative. Then, distributive law look while to operation, p or (q and r) is the same as (p or q) and (p or r). Same thing here if we have p and (q or r) is (p and q) or (p and r). Identity law is p or false is p, p and true is p, then we have domination law p or true is always true, p and false is always false. So we've done those, so we use those laws of propositions sometimes to prove or to simplify expression or to show two logical expressions are equivalent. [COUGH] So for example, we need to show that this distributive law, we need to show that this is the same. Let's prove this, yeah, p or (q and r) are equivalent to (p or q) and (p or r). Let's try to show it, so one way to show it is do the truth table for p or (q and r) that is truth table. And do the truth table for the second expression which is (p or q) and (p or r). And you can see this column is the same as this column, means those two propositions are false at the same time and true at the same time. Therefore, they are equivalent, they say the same thing, they have the same meaning, okay? So we just did show that the or is distributive over the and operator. Now, we also looked at some other laws of proposition. We looked at De Morgan's law, not (p or q) = not p and not q, not (p and q) = not p or not q. Then absorption low, p or (p and q) = p, p and (p or q) = p. Now, we'll call that the negation law p or not p is always true, p and not p is always false. We also double negation not of not p is always p. So, this is the laws that we will be using to prove that two expressions are. Well, let's try to use this, let's see if we can prove that this expression here, is equivalent to the second expression. Tamara I will check that after this session, yeah, I will check that. You need to, if you've seen 219, the one that you need to do is 2021, yeah, that's the one. Okay, let's show this expression is the same as this expression or they are equivalent, okay? So let's start from this expression see if we can arrive to the second one. So this is the expression that is given to us. Now we use De Morgan's law, yeah, De Morgan's law will allow us to say change this to not p or not( not p or q), that's De Morgan's law. Now, why use De Morgan's law on this path here again second time? That will give me not p or ((not of not p) and not q), that's just De Morgan's law. Now, I use double negation, not of not p, adjust p, so I end up with not p or (p or not q). Yeah, now I use distributive law that will not p or (p and not p) and (not p or not q). Then I use the compliment law, I know that (not p or p) just always true. Then I use the identity law which says that true and p is always p. So true and (not p or not q) this is basic to using the identity law allows us to say that this is equal not p or not q, okay? So that is just an example how we show that two logical propositions are equivalence, yeah, two logical propositions are equivalent. We can either do the truth table which is long and sometimes it can be really annoying and it takes a lot, especially if the expression is long, and has many sub propositions. So, but for me, I prefer using the laws of propositions to prove that two logical propositions are the same. Again, in the exam, if it shows you, if the question specifies use the truth table, then you have to use the truth table, if the question specifies. Yeah, I think when you say something you have to say what a rule did you use, you have to back up your answer. Okay, so I went really bit fast, but this is what you need to know, I just give you a summary of the propositional logic topic, yeah? What we've talked about today is what you need to now from that topic. So now what I will do, I welcome questions. And if you have any question about the midterm assessment and all the questions that you were asking, I can answer them. So next is, if I go to tutorial, have you got any question here in the tutorial? Yes, if the method is not stated it's your choice, either use truth table or use propositional laws, yeah? Yeah, so it's up to you. Analyze the question, specify, use the truth table or use laws of proposition then in that case you have to use that. Has anyone got any question? In this done I can go through it. Any exercise here that you want me to go through? Yes, it is. Problem sheet question two solution is wrong, let's look at the question 2.2. Question 2.2, what does it say? Let me see. One second, Tip one, two, okay? So stock are increasing, so let me see as stock are increasing, And other one t means interest rates are steady. Interest rates are steady. So, the first, again, neither, All right? Neither are [INAUDIBLE], okay? One second, so, Stocks, Increasing, No, Interest, Steady, okay? All right, just let me, Okay, can you see the iPad now? So what is the answer to this? So stocks are increasing, that's s, and t interest rate are steady. So neither are stocks increasing nor are interest rates steady. What should be the answer? Who set this question? It's Lee, Lee what do you think the answer should be to this? Yes, it should be, is not s and not t, Yeah, which is the same as not (s or t). That's it, Okay, if it says that I will changes it, apologize for that. It's neither nor that is make it, but if the question was, Okay, that is fine, I will change it, thanks for that Lee. The problem, if you look at the topic of propositional logic you'll find it and the solutions are there. Okay, let's go to 13, yeah, Question 13, okay, Question 13. What is the question 13, what does it say? Question 13, okay. Okay Question 13, that is fine, we can go to it and it's, Once the current, okay, Question 13, okay? Let me know this take you to my iPad and, Let's do question 13. So what do we have? We've got key and key two proposition. We need to show either using the truth table. Or using the laws of propositional logic that P implies T is the same as. Is equivalent of not P And The Q. And P. Yeah? This is what we need to show. We need to show that those two propositions are the same. Okay. Well let's start from the first. Let's start from the second one. I can use naught of naught P and Q. And not be unhappy. If I use de Morgan's law if I use de Morgan's law here. What do I have? I have naught P or naught q. And P plus de Morgan's law. Akane for use. Use demerging's law. Then I use distributive law. Let's do use distributive law again. So I use distributive law here. So I'll have not of naught be ntp. Or not key, and P. That's distributive law. So what do I have here? Naught P and P. That's false. Yeah. So now what I have is naught a false or naiught p and q. Okay. Yeah, I can use De Morgan's Laws. There are many ways of doing it. You can use De Morgan's Laws again. I'm trying to find the short cut. I'm trying to do it. Yeah. Then we can. Yeah, we can use De Morgan's law now. Yeah, once we get to it. So here what what do I have f false or not PNP. So this will give me just like, not off. Not P and K. Yeah, and I if I use De Morgan's law here that will give me. Note have naught p or naught q So I made a mistake somewhere there. That's still naught here. So let's repeat this one. I have nought nought. P and q And p that's what I have. So if I have the Morgan's Law, I have not p or Not key. Yeah, and P that's the Morgan's low. Now if I have use distributor which I have not have not P. And pay Or naught P. :32 And P. Yeah, then I have here is false. Then I'll end up with not :43 False or naught P and P Yeah, then this will give me naught. Have an ALT key and P. Yeah I got rid of the false then this will give me is key or naught B. Which is not p or key. Which is the same as P implies Q Does that make sense to you? Yeah? Yeah, you just used those laws. We use De Morgan's laws here. Then we use here distributive law. Then here we just false or P is always P. Then here we use the Morgan's law again. And we now we also know that P implies Q is the same. Is equivalent to not P or Q. :03 Yeah, and that's what we use. Any other question? We can only show that by naught p. P implies Q is the same as not P or Q. We can show that U is [INAUDIBLE] table. :34 So if you have P and if you have Q. And you have naught P here. You have P implies key, and here you have not be Aki. So false false false to True false. And true true. So p is true note p'. P is false not p is true. False implies false is true. Naught p or q 1 true or false is true. Then again here naught p is true. P or q false implies true is true. Naught p or q is true. And here, naught p is false. True implies false is false. Then naught p or p is false. Then, we move to this last one, which is here as follows. P plus q is true. Naught p or q is true. And you can see that this column here And this column here are the same. Therefore, p implies q is equivalent to not p or not q. Does that make sense to you, Asif, Sayif, sorry, yeah? Is there any question you want me to talk about? :09 The exam, let's take you to the midterm exam. I think I have the midterm exam here. :18 This is the midterm assessment, not exam, the assessment that you have this year, yeah? :27 So you should have this one that you have. Have you got all access to this one? :43 Okay, so there are five, one question about sets, yeah, one question about functions, :55 And one questions about propositional logic, questions about predicate logic, and a question about Boolean algebra, yeah? They are not very hard, though some of them you might find. They should all be okay. So you all have access to this. This is the midterm assessment for this year. :30 Thanks, what other question have you got? Yes, that is correct. :44 5a. :01 Yeah, find the value, is it true, false? [LAUGH] :17 So you've got x plus y and x and y. :25 Okay, if and only if, okay, all right, let me explain that. The difference between, :36 The difference between only if, :47 Yeah, and versus if and only, :54 If and only if, okay. :00 So if I say p only if q, :12 This means equivalent to p implies q. :24 Yeah, but if I say p if only if q, this is an equivalence, yeah? This means p equivalent to q, which means this p implies q and q implies p. :03 Yes, you are allowed. Rafael, yes, you are allowed to draw and upload images, yes, and put images in the PDF. :24 Yes, okay, let's explain this. So if I say p if q, :38 Yeah, this is the same as q implies p. :45 And if I say p only if q, if I add this only here, it becomes p implies q. :59 However, if I say p if only if, this is the equivalence, means if only if q, this means that p is equivalent to q, and the direction in both way. :19 Yeah, which means p equivalent to q, which is the same as p apparently, which is the same as p implies q and q implies p. :37 Does that make sense? :55 Okay, let me say question 4c. So let me go back to question 4c, no, not this one, this one, 4c. :17 Yes, yes, that's what it is, yeah? :23 You have to specify which rules till you get to the conclusion is true. :34 Is there any other question? :37 Midterm work, question 1c. :52 Yeah, in this case, you have to show that the power set of the union. Yeah, what you need to do, you need to show that the power set of A union B is equal to the power set of A union the power set of B, yeah? That's why you need to show here. :18 [COUGH] So, So what you need to do if you take, for example, you need to show, there's two ways of showing it. You need to show that power set of A union B is a subset of power set of A union power set of B. :46 And you also and a set of A, :04 No no, no, this is prove or disapprove, yeah? Is that correct or incorrect? It might not be correct, I don't know. So if it's correct, you have to show that this is true. And you also have to show that person I look this power set of A, union power set of B, is subset of power set of A union B. If it's not correct, then find me a counter example, yeah? If it's not correct, then come up with a counter example which means come up over the set A, it has something. And set B, it has some other element, and show the power set of A union B is different from power set of A union power set of B. :00 Yeah, does that make sense? Who asked this question? 1 c. :11 Yeah, let me repeat here, if you think the power set of A union power set of B is equal to power set of A union power set of B. Then you need to show the power set of A union B is a union of subset of power set of A union power set of B and power set of A union power set of B is a subset of power set of A union B. :51 That means take an element in this power set set, find that it is also an element of this and take an element of this and show that it is an element of this, yeah? So if you think it's true, that's what you need to do. If you think it's false, then give me two sets and we come up with two sets A and B. That shows that power set of A union B is different from power set of A union power set of B. :35 Question 2 d, okay, question 2 d, okay. :48 Okay, Okay, let me tell you what. Let's say I have a set A, it has got A and B. And I have a set B, let's say, :15 Let's say I have a set x, no, not even x. Let's have a set S1, it has got A and B. And I will set S2, it has go 1 and 2, and S1 crossed yeah? Is the set of pairs, so the pairs will be what? a1, a2, b1, b2, yeah? Is a set of pairs where the first element of the pair is in S1 and the second element of a pair is in S2. Who asked this question? :13 Sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, I was talking to myself. Okay, so okay. Let's say S1, is got two element, a and b. And S2, another set here, has got two element, 1 and 2. So S1, which is the crossed product of S1 is a set of pairs, this is the first pair a1. So the first element, so a1 and another one is a2 and another one is b1 and another one is b2 is a set of pairs. :57 Who asked this question? :03 So for example, if I say Z cross Z is a set of pairs, let's say n and m such that n and m are both element of Z, for example 1, 2 is an element of Z cross Z. Let's say 10, 20 is an element of Z. :38 Cross Z, yeah, is that the cost product, okay. :52 Any other question, any other question? :58 So I'm lost with questions here. What do you prefer next time? Shall I do Boolean algebra or predicate logic? :20 Okay, so next week, I'll try to do one next week. It depends, it depends. If I have some time, I set up one next week. :35 Okay, I'll do a Boolean algebra next then after that, I'll do a predicate logic. How about that? :53 Okay that is fine, I'll see what I can do. :05 What is good, any other question that you want me to answer 1 b? Someone said 1 b, yeah, let me see what does 1 b, says, 1 b. :23 No this is not the one, so is this one, yeah? 1 b, 1 b. :34 [LAUGH] :45 So here what you have to do is a one diagram, so what do we have? We have our mini set, we have programming students took programming. So we've got P students took programming. We've got M students who took mathematics and we've got A who took art. :11 Yeah students who took art sorry. :18 Sorry. So this is your Venn diagram. :25 Let me repeat that. So we've got a Venn diagram here. :31 Student to talk programming student to talk mathematics. Students who took art, all you have to do find what numbers goes in here. What numbers goes in here. What numbers goes in here. What numbers goes in here. What numbers goes in here, and what numbers goes in here. :49 Does that make sense? :00 Yeah, so the number that goes in here is the students that are doing programming and math only, the number that goes in here are students who done art and math only. The numbers that goes in here, for example, this area are students who are doing programming and art only. And the number that goes in here are the number of students are doing all three of them. And the number in here are students who are doing none of them :40 Yes, that's fine. Ofelia Not each step for this you just put the numbers there and upload one image. :58 Now just one diagram with all the numbers in the correct place :07 Okay Chi map ,let's do something about Chi map and I know that you're asking about Chi map, suppose I've got this. :18 Let's see the one that I have in, :28 Let me just see. :42 Okay, let's, can you see this? Yeah. :50 Okay. :54 Okay. :00 So if you look, :08 If you look in here, I have x :20 I have this from this table here, I can say F of X, Y, Z is equal from just the the table is equal X prime Y Z plus X, Y prime Z plus X Y Z prime plus X Y Z. Yeah, this is from the table. Sorry. :14 Okay, how do I do this :30 Yeah, can you see both of them now? :36 Okay, so from that table that is given to me, I can find out you take all the one that has got one in the last column of F, and I can see that this function is x prime y z. X,Y prime plus all of them. That's the expression, yup that's the sum product. However, it's too complicated, we can simplify this yeah? On one of the things that we use to simply it is using the Chi map. So let's look at this Chi map of this. So what I have here I have a x prime, I have here x. So X prime is 0. X here is 1. And I have Y prime, Z pi, and I have Y prime Z. And I have YZ, and I have here YZ prime. So the reason I'm doing this, you had the reason I'm doing this, each one from there is all from here. Y prime Z and Y prime Z prime, I have one that is changing and one that is fixed. From here again, what is fixed is Z and what is changing is Y to Y prime from here again, what is fixed is Y and what is changing is Z prime, in this case so let's go back to this this function here and see. :14 So, X prime, where is X prime YZ. :22 Where is X prime YZ? Is this so it's one here. :27 Yeah, it will make this function two because there is order. If one of them is true is the whole thing is true. Where is the next one X Y prime ZX Y prime Z is this one. :41 X Y prime Z, the next one, this one is X,Y prime Z, this is X Y prime Z prime X Y prime Z is this one, another one here. :55 The next one is X Y Z prime. So X Y Z prime is this one. :06 So X, Y Z prime is one. The next one is X Y Z, last one X Y Z is one here. :17 That's all I care about. Now if I can use a different color, I can group those two. :25 Yeah. And I can also group those, all those ones in this column. Yeah, so by grouping those two what is Y Y Z is the same. However X changing from zero to one didn't affect the result is still one one. :49 Yeah, so we can put that X does not affect we can just put Y Z. :57 Let us look at the last one here. :01 This grouping of all those four. :05 It's always 1. Which thing is fixed? :11 X is fixed. X is equal to 1. Is y fixed in all of them? No. y, y prime here, y here, so y does not have an effect. z prime here, z here, so y and z are changing. You only pick the one in a grouping that are fixed. They don't change. So in this case, the only thing that is fixed is x and I just put x. Does that make sense? So do you want me to repeat it? :53 Yeah? What do you do when you do the K-Map? For each grouping, only pick the viable that are fixed, that are not changing, anything that is changing, it doesn't have any effect because changing from y to y prime didn't affect the results. And that's how you do it. Yeah, for each grouping, keep only the viable that are not changing and remove anything that is changing. So from all this expression here now, using the K-Map we simplify it to this. :44 Okay, any other question? :57 Key four a, what kind of example 24 :23 Are you talking about the midterm? Or are you talking about q4 in the midterm assessment, Antonio? :52 >> I think if I give you an example I'll be answering that question. So we are assumed that for all x there exists y that this is true. That our assumption, yeah? We started from this is true, and the domain of this course is not empty. The domain that was not empty, which of the following must be true if the statement is explained? :21 Knowing that this is true, show is this true? Does this leads to this true or not? :33 Or does it lead to this- So I cannot actually are if I say something more I'll be answering your question. :48 Discuss it with your online tutor. :53 Now starting from this, for all x, there exist y where pxy is true. That's our hypothesis. Does that lead to, for all x and for all y, pxy is true. If that is true show why, If that is not true, give it a counter example. :30 Yes, Yeah :48 I think to get a full answer you have to give I think question like this If it's correct, if you say it's correct you get one mark, and if you explained it or gave a example you get another mark. :09 So it's six marks for all of them. Yeah? :21 Is that another question? :41 Well, Iâ€™m glad it is. I will contact you with, how are things with the online, working out with online tutor? Are you all going to them? :58 Okay, I will give you another webinar hopefully soon, it will be either predicate logic or Boolean algebra. But if you have any question and just to let you know that in the video sometime you find something has been all over ported to University of London and they are working to fix all those bags, the other, The midterm assessment :41 Okay, I'll try to do that. The midterm assessment will be on :54 Yeah, the deadline I think is the 11th of January, it should be on the platform. :06 Okay, I think we have to stop here, and I'll see you in the next webinar. And good luck on your study if you have any more question, you can always ask me next webinar. Okay, good luck everyone, have a good day. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 3.2 Applications Lesson 3.3 Extra resources Reading: Reading Propositional logic problem sheet .

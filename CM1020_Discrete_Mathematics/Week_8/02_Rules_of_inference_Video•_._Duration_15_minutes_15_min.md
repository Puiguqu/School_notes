# Rules of inference Videoâ€¢ . Duration: 15 minutes 15 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/iH69Q/rules-of-inference)

Based on the provided transcript, it appears that the topic is about rules of inference in propositional and predicate logic.

Here's a possible response to the discussion prompt:

**Propositional logic and predicate logic**

To address this question, we need to consider the differences between propositional logic and predicate logic. Propositional logic deals with statements that are either true or false, whereas predicate logic extends this to include variables and predicates that can take on multiple values.

Rules of inference in propositional logic are often based on simple logical operations such as conjunction, disjunction, negation, and implication. In contrast, rules of inference in predicate logic involve more complex operations such as universal instantiation, existential generalization, and modus ponens.

When applying rules of inference, it's essential to carefully analyze the structure of the argument and ensure that the premises logically follow from the conclusion.

Some common mistakes when using rules of inference include:

* Affirming the consequence: incorrectly assuming that a true premise implies a true conclusion.
* Denying the antecedent: incorrectly assuming that if a premise is false, then the consequent is also false.
* Existential fallacy: incorrectly assuming that because an individual exists, they have certain properties or characteristics.

To avoid these mistakes, it's crucial to carefully evaluate the logical connections between premises and conclusions.

**Extra resources**

For further learning on rules of inference, I recommend checking out the following resources:

* "Introduction to Model Theory" by Moses Schreiber: This textbook provides a comprehensive introduction to model theory, including an overview of rules of inference.
* "Logic for Mathematics Students" by Patrick Suppes: This textbook provides a clear and concise introduction to propositional and predicate logic, including rules of inference.
* Online resources such as Khan Academy's "Introduction to Logic" course and MIT OpenCourseWare's "Logic" course provide additional support and practice exercises.

**Summative assessment**

For the summative assessment, I will be evaluating students' ability to apply rules of inference in propositional and predicate logic. This will involve a written assignment where students will be presented with a series of logical arguments and asked to identify any fallacies or errors. Additionally, students will be required to provide step-by-step reasoning for their answers.

Grading criteria will include:

* Accuracy and completeness of argument
* Correct application of rules of inference
* Clarity and organization of writing

By the end of this lesson, students should have a solid understanding of rules of inference in propositional and predicate logic and be able to apply them to solve logical problems.

Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key In this lecture, we will talk about the application of De Morgan's laws in predicate logic. We will begin by discussing the intuition behind De Morgan's laws, then we will look at the formal expression of De Morgan's laws. Finally, we will show how De Morgan's laws can be used when negating nested quantifiers. Usually, we need to consider the negation of a quantified expression. Let's consider this example. Let S denote the statement "All the university's computers are connected to the network" and let P denote the statement "There is at least one computer in the university operating on Linux". Intuitively, we know that the negation of S can be verified if there is at least one computer not connected to the network and that the negation of P can be verified if all university computers are not operating on Linux. De Morgan's laws allow us to formalize these intuitions. The rules for negating quantifiers are called De Morgan's laws for quantifiers. These rules can be summarized as follows : let P be a predicate over the variable x, the negation of the statement for all x, P of x is equivalent to the statement, there is an x for which not p of x. The negation of the statement there exists an x for which P of x is equivalent to the statement for every x not P of x. Now let's look at an example to show how this works in practice. Let S be the statement "Every student of Computer Science has taken a course in Neural Networks". S can be expressed as for all x P of x, where the universe of this course U is students in computer science and p of x is the propositional function x has taken a course in neural networks. The negation of S is the statement "It is not the case that every student of Computer Science has taken a course in Neural Networks". This can be expressed as the negation of x p of x which is equivalent to there exists x not P of X. That means that there is at least one student who has not taken a course in neural networks. Let's take a look at another example, let R denote the statement "There is a student of Computer Science who didn't take a course in Machine Learning". R can be expressed as there exists x q of x where the universe of this course U is students in computer science and q of x denotes X didn't take a course in machine learning. The negation of R is the statement "It is not the case that there is a student of computer science who didn't take a course in machine learning". This can be expressed as the negation of there exists x q of x which is equivalent for all x not q of x. This tells us that every student in computer science has taken a course in machine learning. In the case of nested quantifiers, we apply De Morgan's laws successively from left to right. For example, let P of x y z denote a propositional function of variables x y and z. The negation of for all x there exists y for all z, p of x y z is expressed as follows. As you can see here it is built by moving the negation to the right through all quantifiers and replacing each for all with there exists and vice versa. In this lecture, we have looked at how De Morgan's laws can be applied to predicate logic. We began by considering the intuition behind De Morgan's laws then we gave a formal expression of these laws. Finally, we showed how these laws can be used when negating nested quantifiers. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 4.2 Applications Video: Video De Morgan's laws for quantifiers .

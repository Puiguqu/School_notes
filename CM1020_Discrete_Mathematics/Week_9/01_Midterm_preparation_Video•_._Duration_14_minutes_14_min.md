**Midterm Assessment Preparation**

The midterm assessment will cover five topics: Functions, Propositional Logic, Predicate Logic, and Boolean Algebra.

**Topic 1: Functions**

* Domain, co-domain, and range of a function
* Properties of functions (one-to-one, onto, bijective)
* Inverse functions
* Rules for working with inverse functions

**Topic 2: Propositional Logic**

* Definition of a proposition
* Compound propositions using AND, OR, NOT, IMPLIES, EQUVALENT
* Truth tables and truth sets for compound propositions
* Laws of propositional logic (idempotent law, commutative law, associative law, distributive law)
* De Morgan's laws

**Topic 3: Predicate Logic**

* Difference between a predicate and a proposition
* Quantifiers (universal quantifier, existential quantifier, uniqueness quantifier)
* Nested quantifiers
* Rules of inference (Modus ponens, Modus tollens, conjunctions, disjunctive syllogism)
* Combining rules of inference for propositions and quantified statements

**Topic 4: Boolean Algebra**

* Laws of Boolean algebra (distributive law, commutative law, associative law)
* Building blocks and logic gates
* Converting Boolean expressions to logical circuits
* Simplifying Boolean expressions using Karnaugh maps

**Study Resources**

* Video: "Midterm Preparation" (14 minutes)
* Video: "Introduction to Boolean Algebra" (5 minutes)
* Discussion Prompt: "What do you know about Boolean algebra?" (20 minutes)
* Reading: "Postulates of Boolean Algebra" (15 minutes)
* Practice Assignment: "Postulates of Boolean Algebra" (25 minutes)
* Video: "Boolean Functions" (5 minutes)
* Practice Assignment: "Boolean Functions" (30 minutes)

**Additional Study Resources**

* Reading: Essential reading for Topic 5 (2 hours)

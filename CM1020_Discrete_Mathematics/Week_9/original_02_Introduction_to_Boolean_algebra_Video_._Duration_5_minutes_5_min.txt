Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key In this lecture, we will introduce a new topic called Boolean algebra. We'll begin by looking at the history of Boolean algebra, as well as its applications. Then, we will introduce a form of Boolean algebra called Two-valued Boolean algebra. Finally, we will look at the basic operations of Boolean algebra. Let's begin by looking back at the history of Boolean algebra. Between 384 and 322 BC, Aristotle established the foundations of logic. In 1854, George Boole published an investigation of the laws of thought, which developed a system of logical algebra by which reasoning can be expressed mathematically. In 1904, Huntington published a book entitled New sets of Independence Postulates of the algebra of logic, in which he defined the six rules or postulates of Boolean algebra. In 1938, Claude Shannon wrote a thesis entitled, A symbolic analyses of relay switching circuits, in which Boolean algebra was investigated as a tool for analyzing and designing a relay switching circuits. Today, Boolean algebra is the foundation of computer circuits analysis. Boolean algebra is the basic block for designing transistors which are the basic elements in building processors. For instance, let's consider the following Internet of Things system, IoT. When the system is activated, a fire sprinkler should spray water if high heat is detected. This system can be designed using a Boolean algebra equation. For example, w equals h and a, where the variable h represents high heat is detected. The variable a represents the system is activated, and w represents spray in water. The most well-known form of Boolean algebra is a two-valued system, where variables can only have values of zero or one. The operators plus and dots are used instead of all and and. Plus corresponds to the operator or, whereas, dot corresponds to the end operator. Two-valued Boolean algebra can be used to describe and design digital circuits. Boolean algebra is based on three fundamental operations. The first is the and operator, which is the logical product used to represent the logical conjunction, and. For example, for the expression x and y, we simply write x. y. The second is the or operator, which is represented using the logical sum plus. For example, x or y equals x+ y. The third and final operator is the logic complement or the not operator, which can be represented as follows x prime compliment of x, or not x. When parentheses are not used, these three operators have the following order of precedence, not followed by and followed by all. The two table for the logical product is as follows. As you can see, this is similar to the truth table of the and operator. The true table for the logical sum plus is as follows, and as you can see, this is similar to the true table of the or operator. Finally, here is the true table of the not operator. In this lecture, we introduced Boolean algebra. We began by looking at the history of Boolean algebra, as well as its present day applications. Then, we introduced a form of Boolean algebra called two-valued Boolean algebra. Finally, we looked at the three basic operations of Boolean algebra. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Video: Video Midterm preparation .

Liz Wilkinson, a Careers Consultant at the University of London, welcomes participants to the career development stage. She emphasizes that career development can mean different things for different people, such as climbing the ladder or specialization. After 35 years of work, she has experienced various career development phases and encourages participants to consider their own qualities. The experience gained from studying at the University of London is a significant factor in career development.

Participants may feel uncertain about acquiring new skills, understanding the sector, or networking. Liz suggests starting with self-reflection exercises, such as identifying one's strengths and weaknesses. She references Edwin's point on impostor syndrome, which highlights the importance of self-convincing oneself.

Liedtka's three elements of strategic thinking are discussed: (1) system's perspective, (2) intent focus, and (3) keeping the vision in front of one. A strategic manager at the University of London illustrates this by emphasizing the need to "keep your eye on the end prize." Liz introduces the concept of "thinking in time," which involves looking at past experiences, present circumstances, and future predictions and scenarios.

Strategic thinkers are hypothesis-driven and respond intelligently to changes. This approach can be applied to career development, where participants should examine the big picture, look for growing or declining markets, and consider their own goals and values. The course will guide participants through a five-step process to develop their career.

The course aims to help participants think strategically about their careers, rather than just looking for job opportunities. By applying strategic thinking principles, participants can make informed decisions about their career development and create a fulfilling life.

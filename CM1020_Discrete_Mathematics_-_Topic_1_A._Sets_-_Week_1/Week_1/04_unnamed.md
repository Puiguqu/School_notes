Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

1. The lesson discusses two ways of representing a set: listing method and set-builder notation.
2. The listing method involves listing all elements of a set, as seen in examples such as S1 (vowels in English alphabet) and S2 (positive integers less than 10).
3. Set-builder notation uses a rule of inclusion to describe the set, such as "the set of even positive integers less than 10" or "the set of all rational numbers Q".
4. The set-builder notation can be written in a formulaic way, e.g., S1 = {3n | n ∈ Z, 0 < n < 6}.
5. Rational numbers (Q) can be represented as Q = {n/m | n, m ∈ Z, m ≠ 0}.
6. The set of objects in a bag can also be described using both methods: listing method by listing elements (e.g., pen, book, laptop) and set-builder notation (e.g., "a bag is the set of x, where x is in my bag").
7. Set S1 consists of all integers 3n where n is a natural number strictly less than 6.
8. The value of n in S1 ranges from 1 to 5, resulting in elements {3, 6, 9, 12, 15}.
9. Set S2 represents all numbers of the form 2^n where n is an integer between 0 and 4 (inclusive).
10. S2 can be rewritten as {2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4} = {1, 2, 4, 8, 16}.
11. Set S3 consists of all integers of the form 3n where n is an integer.
12. The elements of S3 are {0, 3, 6, 9, 12}.
13. To summarize, a set can be represented in two ways: by listing its elements or using set-builder notation.
14. Both methods convey the same information about the elements and properties of the set.
15. Understanding both listing method and set-builder notation is essential for working with sets in mathematics and other fields.

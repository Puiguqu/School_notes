Lecture in Computer Science at Goldsmiths, University of London. My research area is in the field of machine learning and its applications. In this module, I will introduce you to discrete mathematics. What is discrete mathematics? Discrete mathematics is a branch of mathematics that deals with discrete or distinct objects rather than continuous objects. It is concerned with the study of structures and algorithms used to represent and manipulate discrete objects. Discrete objects are separated or distinct from each other. For example, integers or rational numbers. It is a very good tool for improving reasoning and problem solving capabilities. Discrete mathematics is an important field of study with many applications in computer science and other fields. It is a broad field that encompasses many different area of study, and it is an important foundation for the study of computer science. It has many applications in computer science and other field. In recent decades, discrete mathematics has numerous applications in computer size. It is used in programming languages, software development, cryptography, and algorithms. One of the main areas of study in discrete mathematics is graph theory. This is used to model and analyze networks such as social networks, transportation networks, and communication networks. Boolean algebra studies logical operation such as and, or, and not, and their application in computer circuits. Boolean algebra is used to design and analyze digital circuits, and it is an important foundation for studying computer size. Data structures are used to store and manipulate data in a way that is efficient and effective, and they are an important aspect of computer size. Discrete mathematics is used to design and analyze data structure and to study the complexity of algorithms that manipulate data structure. In this module, I will introduce and we explain the fundamental concept of sets, functions, relations, graphs, trees, logics, combinatorics, mathematical proofs, and recursive relations. This module consists of 10 topics over 20 weeks, so two weeks per topic. The assessment for this module consists of three elements. 10 summative quizzes worth 20% of your final grade, midterm assignment worth 30% of your final grade and the final exam, which is worth 50% of your final grade. By studying this module, you gain a mathematical understanding of these topics that will improve your skills in thinking abstractly and will support you through your studies in computer science. The mode syllables is on the Coursera module home page. The next step for you is to read this document as it gives a detailed explanation of the learning outcomes, assessments, and reading list. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 1.0 Introduction to the course Video: Video Introduction to discrete mathematics .

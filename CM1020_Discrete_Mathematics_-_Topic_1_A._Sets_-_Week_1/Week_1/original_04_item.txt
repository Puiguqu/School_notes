Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key In this lesson, we will look at the following ways of representing a set. The first one is the listing method, the second one is the set-builder notation also called as the rule of inclusion. Representing a set using the listing method consists of listing all the elements of a set, we have already used this method to represent a set. Here are three examples of listing method. S1 is the set of all vowels in the English alphabet. We just write S1 and we list all the elements a, e, i , o, and u. S2 is the set of all positive integers less than 10. We just write S2 and we list all the element of S2 which are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. S3 is the set of all even positive integers less than 10. Similarly, we just write S3 and we list all the elements which are 2, 4, 6, 8. We now look at the set of even integers. We can clearly see that all the elements of the set are multiples of two. It's two times three, two times two, two times one, two times zero, and so on. We can write this set as the set of elements of two times n, such that n is an element of Z, and this notation is called the set-builder notation. Similarly, the set of all odd integers are of the form two times n plus one. One is two times zero plus one, two times one plus one, two times two plus one, two times three plus one, and so on till two times minus three plus one. We can write this set as follow, is the set of elements of the form two times n plus one, such that n is an element of Z, so this is the set builder notation of odd numbers. Suppose we want to represent the set of all rational numbers Q, we can't really represent this set accurately using the listing method. However, using the set-builder method, we can represent Q more accurately as follow. We can write Q is the set of elements of the form n over m, such that n and m are elements of Z and m is different from zero. The set of objects in my bag is described using the following. First, we use the Listing Method by listing all the elements that are in the bag, which is a pen, book, a laptop, and any element that's in the bag. The next notation is you can use the Set-Builder notation by writing, a bag is just the set of elements x, such that x is in my bag. In this exercise, we will list all the elements of a set represented using the Set-Builder Method. The set S1 is the set of elements of the form three times n, such that n is a natural number and n is strictly less than six. The value of n will be from one to five. All we do is substitute the value of n in this formula here. S1 will have the elements three times one, three times two, three times three, three times four, three times five, which means the S1 will have the following elements. Three, six, nine, 12, and 15. Now, look at the second set S2. S2 is the set of elements of the form two to the power of n, such that n is an integer and n is between zero and four, where zero and four are included. Similarly, we can write S2 is two to the power of zero, two to the power of one, two to the power of two, two to the power of three, two to the power of four, which means that S2 will have the following elements, one, two, four, eight, and 16. Finally, the set S3 is the set of elements of the form, two to the power minus n, such that n is an integer and n is between zero and eight, where zero is included but eight is not. We can write this set S3 as follows, two to the power of zero, two to the power minus1, two to the power of minus two, to the last value of n which is seven, two to the power of minus seven. Therefore, S3 will have the following element, one, one over two, one over four, one over eight, one over 16, one over of the 32, one over 64, and finally one over one over 128. In this exercise, we will take a set represented using the listing method and rewritten using set-builder method. For example, the set S1 has the following elements. One over two, one over four , one over six, one over eight, one over 10. We can clearly see that the elements of this set are of the form two times n. One over two times one, one over two times two, one over two times three, one over two times four, one over two times five. We can rewrite this set as a set of the form one over 2n such that n is an integer, and n between zero and five, zero not included and five included. If we look at here one, two, three, four, five, so n is between zero and five. Now, look at the second set S2. It contains those element. We can clearly see the all those element are of the form two to the power of n. One is two to the power of zero, two to the power one, two to the power of two, two to the power of three, two to the power four, and so on until we get two to the power of seven which is 128. We can rewrite this set using the set-builder method or notation, as to the set of element of the form two times n, such that n is an element of z and n is between zero and seven where zero and seven are included. As we can see here, n starts from zero and ends in seven. Finally, look at the set S3, we can see that the element of this set are of the form three times n. Zero is three times zero, three times one, three times two, three times three, and so on. We can rewrite this set using the set-builder notation as follows. Is a set of elements of the form three times n, such that n is an element of z. To summarize to represent a set, first we give a description of what elements it present, then we represent this set by listing the elements of the set, or using the set-builder notation. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 1.0 Introduction to the course Lesson 1.1 Introduction to set theory Video: Video The definition of a set .

Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key In today's lesson, we will look at the notion of a power set of a set. We will look at how to define a powerset of a given set. And we will also look at how to workout the cardinality of a powerset of a set. The elements of a set can be set themselves. The example here shows, but the sets colored in yellow are subsets of the set A. However, there are elements of the set B. For example, the set containing 1, 2, 3 and 4 is a subset of A. But it is an element of B. Using the correct notation, describes the relation between the remaining two subsets and sets A and B. Pause the video now on have ago. The first set contains the element 5 and 6. Both 5 and 6 are also element of A. Therefore that set containing 5 and 6 is a subset of the set A. However, the set containing 5 and 6 is not a subset of B, but as you can see, it's an element of the B. And we can write this set is an element of B. Similarly for the second set containing 7, 8, and 9. We can say that 7 is an element of A, 8 is an element of A. And 9 is an element of A. Therefore, this set is a subset A. However, the set containing 7,8, 9 is not a subset of B, but it's an element of B. And we can write that this set is an element of B. So, the set containing 5 and 6 is a subset A, but it's an element of B. Similarly, the set containing 7, 8, 9 in the subset of A but it's an element of the set B. We now give a definition of a powerset of a set. Given a set S, the powerset of a S written as P(S), is the set whose elements are all the subsets S. Given the set S containing three elements, 1, 2 and 3, here are the 8 subset of S. The power set of S P(S) is the set consisted of all subsets of S, hence the power set of S is as follow. Now the elements of a power set of S are all the subsets of S. Now let's try some exercises that will summarize what we have covered so far. If S is a set containing two elements A and B, first right down, the P(S). Then answered the following questions. Is the set containing {a} a subset or an element of the P(S)? And is the empty set an element or a subset of a P(S)? Pause the video now and have ago. The element of a P(S) are all the subset of S. So therefore we can write the first element is the empty set. The empty set is a subset of S therefore it's an element of a P(S). The set containing the element {a} on it's own is a subset Of S, therefore it's an element of a power set to S. Also, the set containing b on its own is a subset of S, therefore, it's an element of a power set. The last subset of S is the set containing a and b. So this is the power set of S, It contains all the subsets of S, the empty set, the set containing a, the set containing b and the set containing a and b. We can see that the set containing the element a on its own, is an element of a power set of S. Therefore we can write that this set is an element of a power set of S. Similarly, the empty set is an element of a power set of S, so we can write that the empty set is an element of a power set of S. As we have seen before, that the empty set is a subset of any set, then we can safely say that the empty set is also a subset of a power set of S. So the empty set is an element of a power set of S, and it is also a subset of a power set of S. In the following exercise, we want to try to find the power set of the empty set as well as the power set, of the power set ,of the empty set. The empty set, is the only subset of the empty set. Therefore, the power set of the empty set is the set containing the empty set. Therefore, the empty set, is a subset, of a power set, of the empty set. Also the set, containing the empty set, is a subset of the power set of the empty set. Therefore the power set, of the power set, of the empty set contains the empty set, its first element, and the set containing the empty set as its second element. We now look at the relation between the cardinality of a set and the cardinality of its corresponding powerset. By definition, the cardinality of a power set of a set S, is equal to 2 to the power of the cardinality of S. This example shows that the cardinality of S is equal to 3. So here is the power set of S. As you can see, the power set of S contains 8 elements, which is just 2 to the power of 3, which is equal to 2 to the power of the cardinality of S. In this exercise, given a set A containing an element, we want to workout the cardinality of the power set, of the power set, of the power set of A. So by definition, the cardinality of the power set of A ages 2 to the power of n. Hence, the cardinality, of the power set, of the power set of A is equal to 2 to the power of the cardinality of the power set of A, which is 2 to the power of 2, to the power of n. Therefore, the cardinality of a power set, of the power set, of the power set of A is just 2, to the power of 2, to the power of 2, to the power of n. In this lesson, we looked at how to find the power set of a given set. We also examined the relationship between the cardinality of a given set and the cardinality of its corresponding power set. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 1.0 Introduction to the course Lesson 1.1 Introduction to set theory Video: Video The definition of a set .

Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key In this lesson, we will look at set operations. The outline of this lesson is as follow. We first look intersection of sets, the union of sets, set difference, and the symmetric difference. Given two sets A and B, the union of A and B written as A union B is the set containing all the elements in either A or B. Here is A union B using the set builder notation. X is an element of the union of A and B if and only if x is an element of A or an element of B. In this example we've got the set A containing the element 2, 4, 6, 8 and the set B containing the elements 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 so the union of A and B is the set containing all the elements of A and all the elements of B and we write A union B is the set containing 2, 4, 6, 8 plus the element of the set B. Membership tables show all the combination of sets that an element can belong to. One means the element belongs to the set whereas zero means it does not belong to the set. Here is an example of a membership table for A union B. For example here zero means an element is not in A and here zero means an element is not in B. If an element is not in A and not in B then it shouldn't be in the union. An element is not in A but is in B it's an element of A union B. An element in A but not in B is also an element of A union B. If an element is in A and in B then it's also an element of A union B. We now talk about the intersection. Given two sets A and B the intersection of A and B written as A intersection B is the set containing the elements that belong to A and B. I repeat the elements that belong to A and B. Here is A intersection B using the set builder notation. X is an element of the intersection of A and B if and only if x is an element of A and x is an element of B. For example there are two sets A and B. If we look at these two sets they have the element 3 and 7 in common. Therefore the intersection of A and B is just set containing only 3 and 7. We now show the membership table of A intersection B. If an element is not in A and it's not in B then it's not an element of A in intersection B. If an element is not in A but it's in B then it's not an element of the intersection of A and B. If an element is in A and it's not in B then it's not an element of A intersection B. If an element is in A and it's in B then it's an element of A intersection B. Now we talk about the set difference. Given two sets A and B the set difference written as A minus B contains the elements that are in A but not in B. Here is A minus B using the set builder notation. X is an element of A minus B if and only if x is an element of A and X is not an element of B. For example here are two sets the set A and B. Both sets have got three elements in common which is 3, 7 and 4. The set difference A minus B is the set A taken away from it all the elements that are in B means we will take away from A 3, 4 and 7 therefore will have A minus B a just A the element the are in A but we take away from them any element that belongs to B. Then we'll get the set A minus B is just the set containing 2 and 6 only. The membership table of A minus B is as follow. If an element is not in A and it's not in B then it's not in A minus B. If an element if it's not in A but it's in B then it is in A minus B. If an element is in A but is not in B then it should be in A minus B. If an element is in A and in B then it shouldn't be in A minus B. Will now talk about the symmetric difference. Given two sets A and B the symmetric difference written as A plus inside the circle B contains the element that are in B or A but not in both. Here is the symmetric difference of A and B using the set builder notation. X is an element of the symmetric difference of A and B if and only if x is an element of A or an element of B but not an element of the intersection of A and B. This means that the symmetric difference of A and B is just the union of A and B with all the common element of A and B are removed. Here is an example of two sets A and B. A plus B or the symmetric difference of AB contains only the elements that are in A and not in B which are 2 and 6 plus the element the are in B but are not in A which are 5 and 1. The symmetric difference of A and B is just the set containing 1, 2, 5, 6. The membership table of the symmetric difference of a set A and the set B is as follow. If an element is not in A and it's not in B then it's not an element of the symmetric difference of A and B. If an element is not in A but it's an element of B then it is an element of the symmetric difference of A and B. If an element is in A but it's not in B then it is an element of the symmetric difference of A and B. If an element is in A and in B then it's not an element of the symmetric difference of A and B. Here is an example of two sets. The set A contains three elements 1, 2, 3 and the set B contains the elements 3, 4, 5. Notice that those two sets has the element 3 in common. The union of A and B contain the following elements. All the elements of A and all the elements of B however we only write three ones because it's in both of them. The intersection of A and B contains only the elements that have in common. The only element that those two sets have in common is three therefore the intersection of A and B is a set containing the only element which is three. The set difference is as follow is the set is all the elements of A takeaway from it any element that's in B. It's 1, 2, 3 and we take away from A 3 which is in B so we end up with A minus B is just the set containing one and two. For the symmetric difference we only take the elements that are in A are not in B, so one and two and we're up to them the element that are in B are not in A which are four and five. The symmetric difference of A and B contain 1, 2, 4, 5. This membership table summarizes the set operation covered in this lecture. Here we can see the set union, set intersection, the set difference, and finally the symmetric difference. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 1.0 Introduction to the course Lesson 1.1 Introduction to set theory Video: Video The definition of a set .

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Discrete mathematics is a branch of mathematics that deals with discrete or distinct objects rather than continuous objects. It studies structures and algorithms used to represent and manipulate discrete objects. Discrete objects are separated or distinct from each other, such as integers or rational numbers. Discrete mathematics has many applications in computer science, including programming languages, software development, cryptography, and algorithms.

Graph theory is one of the main areas of study in discrete mathematics, used to model and analyze networks such as social networks, transportation networks, and communication networks. Boolean algebra studies logical operations such as AND, OR, and NOT, and their application in computer circuits. It is an important foundation for studying computer science and has many applications.

Data structures are used to store and manipulate data efficiently and effectively, and they are a crucial aspect of computer science. Discrete mathematics is used to design and analyze data structures and study the complexity of algorithms that manipulate them. The module covers 10 topics over 20 weeks, with two weeks per topic.

The assessment consists of three elements: 10 summative quizzes (20% of final grade), a midterm assignment (30% of final grade), and a final exam (50% of final grade). By studying the module, students gain a mathematical understanding of discrete mathematics topics that improve their skills in thinking abstractly. The course includes a video introduction to discrete mathematics, readings on the syllabus and getting started, and a careers video.

The discussion prompt asks students what they know about sets, which is an important concept in discrete mathematics. Set theory is introduced in Lesson 1.1, covering topics such as union, intersection, and complement of sets. The module is designed to improve reasoning and problem-solving capabilities, making it an essential field of study for computer science and other fields.

Overall, the course aims to provide students with a mathematical understanding of discrete mathematics topics that will support their studies in computer science.

## Careers video Video• . Duration: 3 minutes 3 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/5rWad/careers-video)

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Liz Wilkinson, a Careers Consultant at the University of London, welcomes participants to the career development stage. She emphasizes that career development can mean different things for different people, such as climbing the ladder or specialization. After 35 years of work, she has experienced various career development phases and encourages participants to consider their own qualities. The experience gained from studying at the University of London is a significant factor in career development.

Participants may feel uncertain about acquiring new skills, understanding the sector, or networking. Liz suggests starting with self-reflection exercises, such as identifying one's strengths and weaknesses. She references Edwin's point on impostor syndrome, which highlights the importance of self-convincing oneself.

Liedtka's three elements of strategic thinking are discussed: (1) system's perspective, (2) intent focus, and (3) keeping the vision in front of one. A strategic manager at the University of London illustrates this by emphasizing the need to "keep your eye on the end prize." Liz introduces the concept of "thinking in time," which involves looking at past experiences, present circumstances, and future predictions and scenarios.

Strategic thinkers are hypothesis-driven and respond intelligently to changes. This approach can be applied to career development, where participants should examine the big picture, look for growing or declining markets, and consider their own goals and values. The course will guide participants through a five-step process to develop their career.

The course aims to help participants think strategically about their careers, rather than just looking for job opportunities. By applying strategic thinking principles, participants can make informed decisions about their career development and create a fulfilling life.

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/iq8RO/the-definition-of-a-set)

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Set theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with properties of well-defined collections of objects. The concept of sets was introduced by George Cantor, a German mathematician. A set is defined as a collection of any kind of objects, such as people, ideas, or numbers. The empty set is a set that contains nothing and is denoted by curly brackets with no elements inside. Sets can be written in the form E = {elements}, where the elements are listed between curly brackets. For example, the set of positive even numbers less than 10 is represented as E = {2, 4, 6, 8}. The cardinality of a set S, denoted by |S|, is the number of elements in the set. The empty set has no elements and therefore its cardinality is 0.

A set A is considered a subset of another set B if every element of A is also an element of B. This is equivalent to saying that if x is an element of A, then x is also an element of B for all elements x. The empty set is a subset of any set and a set is always a subset of itself. There are special sets such as N (natural numbers), Z (integers), Q (rational numbers), and R (real numbers). Each of these sets can be related to the others, where N is a subset of Z, Z is a subset of Q, and Q is a subset of R.

The concept of set theory forms the basis of several other fields of study such as counting theory, relations, graph theory, and finite state machines. Understanding sets and their properties is essential in these fields.

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/bcNmd/the-listing-method-and-rule-of-inclusion)

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

1. The lesson discusses two ways of representing a set: listing method and set-builder notation.
2. The listing method involves listing all elements of a set, as seen in examples such as S1 (vowels in English alphabet) and S2 (positive integers less than 10).
3. Set-builder notation uses a rule of inclusion to describe the set, such as "the set of even positive integers less than 10" or "the set of all rational numbers Q".
4. The set-builder notation can be written in a formulaic way, e.g., S1 = {3n | n ∈ Z, 0 < n < 6}.
5. Rational numbers (Q) can be represented as Q = {n/m | n, m ∈ Z, m ≠ 0}.
6. The set of objects in a bag can also be described using both methods: listing method by listing elements (e.g., pen, book, laptop) and set-builder notation (e.g., "a bag is the set of x, where x is in my bag").
7. Set S1 consists of all integers 3n where n is a natural number strictly less than 6.
8. The value of n in S1 ranges from 1 to 5, resulting in elements {3, 6, 9, 12, 15}.
9. Set S2 represents all numbers of the form 2^n where n is an integer between 0 and 4 (inclusive).
10. S2 can be rewritten as {2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4} = {1, 2, 4, 8, 16}.
11. Set S3 consists of all integers of the form 3n where n is an integer.
12. The elements of S3 are {0, 3, 6, 9, 12}.
13. To summarize, a set can be represented in two ways: by listing its elements or using set-builder notation.
14. Both methods convey the same information about the elements and properties of the set.
15. Understanding both listing method and set-builder notation is essential for working with sets in mathematics and other fields.

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/iKLUl/the-powerset-of-a-set)

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

A power set of a set S is defined as the set whose elements are all the subsets of S. The cardinality of a power set P(S) is equal to 2 raised to the power of the cardinality of S. For example, given a set A with two elements, {a} and {b}, its power set P(A) contains all possible subsets, including the empty set and individual elements.

The elements of a power set are all subsets of S. Therefore, the empty set is an element of a power set, and it is also a subset of any set. The cardinality of a power set of a set with n elements is 2^n.

To find the power set of a given set, we can list all possible subsets or use the rule of inclusion. For example, if S = {1, 2}, its power set P(S) contains 4 subsets: {}, {1}, {2}, and {1, 2}.

The cardinality of a power set is equal to 2 raised to the power of the cardinality of the original set. This means that the number of possible subsets grows exponentially with the size of the original set.

In general, if A is a set containing n elements, then P(A) contains 2^n subsets. If we apply this process again to find the power set of P(A), we get P(P(A)) with 2^(2^n) subsets.

This process can be repeated indefinitely, resulting in an infinite number of power sets. However, the cardinality of each subsequent power set remains a power of 2.

Overall, the concept of a power set provides a way to systematically generate all possible subsets of a given set and understand their relationships with each other.

The relationship between the cardinality of a set S and its corresponding power set P(S) is well-defined: |P(S)| = 2^|S|.

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/btz8b/set-operations)

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

The lesson discusses set operations, including intersection, union, difference, and symmetric difference. Given two sets A and B, the union of A and B (A ∪ B) contains all elements in either A or B. The membership table shows combinations of sets that an element belongs to, with 0 indicating not a member and 1 indicating a member. The intersection of A and B (A ∩ B) contains elements belonging to both A and B.

The formula for the union is: X ∈ A ∪ B if and only if X ∈ A or X ∈ B.
The membership table for A ∪ B shows that an element not in A but in B, and vice versa, are included in the union. The intersection (A ∩ B) contains elements belonging to both sets.

For the difference, A \ B, it contains elements in A but not in B: X ∈ A \ B if and only if X ∈ A and X ∉ B.
Membership tables for A \ B show that an element not in A or B is excluded from the difference.

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/supplement/fImoa/the-definition-of-a-set)

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving the original content:

A set is a fundamental concept in mathematics and computer science, representing a collection of distinct objects considered as an object in its own right.

A set can be defined in two ways: Definition 1 states that a set is a collection of objects, while Definition 2 describes it as an unordered collection of distinct elements.

The symbol ∈ denotes membership in a set, such as "a ∈ A" meaning a is an element of set A. Conversely, a symbol ∉ is used to denote non-membership, like "a ∉ A".

Special sets include N (natural numbers), Z (integers), Q (rational numbers), and R (real numbers).

The empty set, denoted as ∅ or {}, represents a set with no elements.

Cardinality of a set refers to the number of distinct elements in that set. For example, |A| = 4 means the cardinality of set A is 4.

Finite sets have a limited number of elements, while infinite sets have an unlimited number of elements. The set of natural numbers N={1,2,3,…} is an example of an infinite set.

To list all elements in a set using the listing method, simply write down each element within curly braces.

For example, the set A = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7} contains the elements 1 through 7.

Similarly, the set B = {2,4,6,8,10} and set C=N={1,2,3,4,…} also contain their respective listed elements.

This listing method is used to represent sets in a clear and concise manner.

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/supplement/aJzdj/sets-reading-and-practice-questions)

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

A set is a collection of unique objects, known as elements or members, that can be anything (numbers, letters, people, etc.). The definition of a set is based on the concept of an element, which is an object that belongs to the set. A set is defined using curly brackets {} containing the elements separated by commas. For example, {1, 2, 3} represents the set containing the numbers 1, 2, and 3. The cardinality of a set refers to the number of unique elements it contains. The listing method involves writing down all the elements of a set in a specific order, while the rule of inclusion allows us to add or remove elements from a set using logical operations (e.g., ∪ for union, ∩ for intersection). The powerset of a set is the set containing all possible subsets of the original set. For example, the powerset of {1, 2, 3} is {{}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}}. Set operations include union (∪), intersection (∩), difference (-), and complement ('). These operations can be performed using logical rules, such as the distributive property. The set builder method involves constructing a set from a rule or condition that defines its elements. For example, {x | x is an integer} represents the set of all integers. Subsets are sets whose elements are also elements of another set. The problem section for Exercises 2.1 on pp.76 asks students to attempt questions 1-27, 30-36, and 41-44. Solutions to these exercises can be found in the "Solutions to Odd-Numbered Exercises" section at the back of the book.

Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key In this lecture, we will introduce and explore logic gates. First, we will discuss basic logic gates and look at their correspondent truth tables, then we will examine multiple input gates, and finally we will show how de Morgan's laws can be represented using logic gates. Let's begin by defining logicgate. Logic gate is an electronic circuit in which the input can be either single input or multiple inputs. Similarly, we end up with either single output or multiple outputs. The outputs are logical function of the inputs. The most basic logic circuits are OR gates, AND gates and invertors or NOT gates. All brilliant functions can be written in terms of these three logic operations, the output of logic gates can be either zero LOW output or one HIGH output. The AND gates produces HIGH output when all inputs are HIGH, otherwise, the output is LOW. The 2- input AND gates is represented by the electrical rotation shown here. The truth table of the AND gate is drawn as follows, the AND operation is written as f=x.y. The OR gates produces a HIGH output when at least one of the inputs is HIGH, otherwise the output is LOW to input OR gate is represented by the electric notation shown here. The truth table of the OR gate is drawn as follows, the OR operation is written as f=x+y. The invertor gate also known as NOT gate has a single input and outputs the opposite signal to that input. If the input is HIGH, its outputs LOW and if the input is LOW, it's outputs HIGH. The NOT gate is represented by the following electrical notation and the truth table of the NOT gate is drawn as follows. The NOT operation is written as f= not X. Now, let's take a look at four additional gates, which results from a combination of the basic gates that we have just seen. The first one is the XOR gates which can be represented by the electrical notation shown here. The output of the XOR gate is high only when the values of the inputs are different and low, otherwise. The second gate is the NAND gate which can be represented with the electrical notation shown here. The NAND gate is just an AND gate followed by an invertor. The third gate is NOR gates which can be represented with the electrical notation shown here. The NOR gate is just an OR gate followed by an invertor. And finally, the fourth gate is the XNOR gate which can be represented with the electrical notation shown here. The XNOR gate is just an XOR gate followed by an inverter. AND, OR, XOR, and XNOR operations are all competitive and associative, they can be extended to more than two inputs. For example, the NOR gates can be applied to three inputs as shown here. NAND and NOR operations are both commutative but not associative extending the number of inputs is less obvious in these two cases. In writing cascaded NAND and NOR operations, we must use the correct guarantees is to signify the proper sequence of the gates. The first of the Morgan's laws can be expressed as follows. The complement of the product of variables is equal to the sum of the compliments of the variables. This equivalence can be designed using logic gates as shown here. The second of the Morgan's laws can be expressed as follows. The compliments of the sum of variables is equal to the product of the compliments of the variables. This equivalence can be designed using logic gates as shown here. In this lecture, we introduced and explored logic gates. We began by looking at three basic logic gates, the OR, AND, and NOT gates. And we studied their corresponding truth tables. Then we looked at XOR, NAND, NOR, and XNOR gates, and examined their relation to the first three basic gates. Finally, we looked at multiple input gates and saw how logic gates can be used to represent the Morgan's laws. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 5.2 Applications Video: Video Logic gates .

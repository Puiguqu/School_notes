Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key In this lecture, we will begin by introducing and define combination circuits or logic networks. Then we will look at, how we can build a logic network from a Boolean function, and how we can find a Boolean function from its correspondent circuit. Finally, we will show how combination circuits can be used in designing systems for solving a particular problem. Combination circuits are the combination of logic gates designed to model Boolean functions. A combination circuit is a circuit that implements a Boolean function. The logic values assigned to the output signals is a Boolean function of the current configuration of input signals. Given a Boolean function, we can implement a logic circuit representing all the states of this Boolean function. Intuitively, we want to minimize the number of gates used in order to minimize the cost of the circuit. A Boolean function can be implemented in different ways using combination circuits. Let's consider a Boolean function with three inputs such as F of x, y, z equals x plus y'z. This function can be represented by the combination circuit shown here. Given logic network, we can work out its corresponding Boolean function as follows. The first step is to label all the gates outputs that are function of the input variables. The second step is to express the Boolean functions for each gate in the first level. Then we repeat this process until all the outputs of the circuit are written as Boolean expressions. Let's see how this works. Consider the following circuit. First, let's label the inputs of the circuit with arbitrary symbols. Second, let's express the Boolean functions for the first-level gate. Now, let's repeat the process for the second and third levels. Combinational circuits can be used to design systems for solving specific problems such as addition or multiplication. The steps for building a combinational circuit to solve a specific problem are as follows. The first step is to label the inputs and outputs using variables. The second step is to model the problem as a Boolean expression. The final step is to replace each operation by its equivalent logic gates. Now, let's consider within an order four to one digit binary bits X and Y. The truth table added two one-digit binary bits is shown here. From this truth table, we can clearly see that sum is just the output of the X OR gates whereas the carry outputs can be represented by the AND gate. Hence, this other can be designed as shown by the electrical notation here. This type of adder is called a half adder. The circuit has only two inputs which is one of its limitation as it can't be used for multi-bit additions. To overcome its limitations, we can transform our half adder into a full adder, which has three inputs instead of two inputs to include the carry bits. The truth table for a full adder is shown here, and from this table we can represent some as the following Boolean expression x, x or y, x or carry in, and we can express carry out as follows xy plus carry in. x, x or y. These two Boolean expressions can be designed in the combinational circuit shown by the electrical notation here. In order to hide the complexity of a circuit, we usually use a box diagram as a simple abstraction presenting only inputs and outputs as shown here. In this lecture, we began by introducing and defining combinational circuits. Then we showed how we can build a logic network from a Boolean function, as well as how to build a Boolean function from its corresponding circuits. Finally, we saw how combinational circuits can be useful for designing systems for solving particular problems. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 5.2 Applications Video: Video Logic gates .

The simplification of circuits using Boolean algebra involves applying the postulates and theorems of Boolean algebra to reduce the complexity of Boolean expressions. Simplifying these expressions translates into simpler digital circuits with fewer gates, which can result in reduced cost, power consumption and increased reliability. Below are some common techniques and examples of simplification. For example, consider the following circuit: This circuit contains two OR gates and three AND gates Components: Inputs: A: One of the binary inputs. B: Another binary input. C: The carry-in input. First OR Logic Gate: The input to this gate is B and C. And it outputs B OR C. Three AND Gates: The first one has input A and B and outputs A AND B. The second one has as inputs A and the output of the first OR gates. It outputs A AND (B OR C) The third AND gate has as input B and the output of the first OR gates. It outputs B AND (B OR C) SECOND OR Gate: It has 3 inputs: which are the outputs from each of the three AND gates. These inputs are (A AND B), (A AND (B OR C) and (B AND (B OR C)) The output of this OR gate represents the output F(A,B,C) of the whole circuit. We now need explain how to use the rules of Boolean algebra to simplify this circuit. The output of this circuit is F(A,B,C)=A.B+A.(B+C)+B.(B+C) We can use postulates and theorems of Boolean algebra to reduce the complexity of the Boolean expression, F(A,B,C). F(A,B,C)= A.B+A.(B+C)+B.(B+C) By applying the distributive law, we have: F(A,B,C)= A.B+A.B+A.C+B.B+B.C By applying Idempotent Law (B and A.B+A.B=A.B) we have F(A,B,C)=A.B+A.C+B+B.C By applying absorption law (B+(B.C)=B), we have F(A,B,C)=A.B+A.C+B+B By applying idempotent law (B+B=B) F(A,B,C)=A.B+AC+B By applying absorption (AB+B=B) law, we have: F(A,B,C)=B+AC Hence the original circuit can be simplified to the following: This logic network consists of two basic digital logic gates: an AND gate and an OR gate. The circuit has three input signals, labelled A, B and C, and produces one output signal. Inputs: There are three input lines: A, B and C. All three inputs are horizontal lines coming from the left side of the diagram. AND Gate: The inputs A and C are fed the AND gate. OR Gate: The OR gate has two inputs. One input is the output of the AND gate. The first input to the OR gate is the original input B which is directly connected to the OR gate without any modification. The output of the AND gate is feed as second input to the OR gate. The output of the OR gate produces the output of the whole circuit. Another way of simplifying circuits is to use a Karnaugh map to simplify its corresponding Boolean expression. Let’s try to use Karnaugh to simplify F(A,B,C). We first write F(A,B,C) in the sum-of-product format F(A,B,C)=A.B+A.B+A.C+B.B+B.C We then build the Karnaugh map given below: As you can see we group the 1s in two groups. The first group is reduced to A.C and the second group is reduced to B. Hence, F(A,B,C)=B+A.C Lesson 5.2 Applications Video: Video Logic gates .

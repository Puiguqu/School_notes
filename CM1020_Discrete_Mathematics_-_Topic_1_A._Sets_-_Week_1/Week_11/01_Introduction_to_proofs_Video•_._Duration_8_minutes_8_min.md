Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving all key information, formulae, and technical details:

1. The lecture introduces three types of proof: direct proof, proof by contraposition, and proof by contradiction.
2. A theorem is a formal statement that can be shown to be true, an axiom is a statement assumed to be true for further arguments, and a lemma is a proven statement used as a step in a larger result.
3. The theorem "there exists a real number between any two not equal real numbers" is formalized as: ∀x, y ∈ ℝ, if x < y, then ∃z ∈ ℝ such that x < z < y.
4. Direct proof involves showing that a conditional statement p implies q is true by assuming p is true and using axioms, definitions, and theorems to show q must be true.
5. Proof by contrapositive involves proving the contrapositive of a conditional statement, not q implies not p, which is equivalent to proving p implies q.
6. The theorem "if n² is even, then n is even" can be proved using direct proof or proof by contraposition.
7. In direct proof, we assume n is even and show that n² is even, but it doesn't seem intuitive to prove this directly.
8. Proof by contradiction involves assuming the statement to be proved is false and showing that this assumption leads to a false proposition.
9. The theorem "there are infinitely many prime numbers" can be proved using proof by contradiction.
10. We assume there are only finitely many prime numbers, list them as p₁, p₂, ..., and show that the product of all primes plus 1 has at least one prime divisor, leading to a contradiction.
11. The three types of proof provide different approaches to proving mathematical statements: direct proof, proof by contraposition, and proof by contradiction.
12. Each type of proof relies on axioms, definitions, theorems, and rules of inference to establish the truth of a statement.
13. Understanding these proofs is essential for building mathematical arguments and developing logical reasoning skills.
14. The lecture emphasizes the importance of formalizing statements and using logical rules to construct valid arguments.
15. By mastering these proof techniques, students can develop a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts and improve their problem-solving skills.

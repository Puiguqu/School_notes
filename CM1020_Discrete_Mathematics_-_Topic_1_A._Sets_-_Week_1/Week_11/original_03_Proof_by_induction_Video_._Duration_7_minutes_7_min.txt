We will begin by looking at how induction can be used to prove formulas, inequalities, and divisibility. We will conclude by looking at an example of an incorrect induction. Let's start by proving a simple formula formalized as the propositional function P of n, the sum from 1 to n is equal n multiplied by n plus 1 divided by 2 for all n in n. As we saw in the previous lecture. In order to prove that a propositional function P of n is true for all n, we need to verify two steps. First, the basis step, where we show that P of 1 is true. Second, the inductive step, where we show that for all k in n, if P of k is true, then P of k plus 1 is true. Now, let's work through the example to demonstrate this. The basis step P of 1 reduces to 1 equals 1, multiplying 1 plus 1 divided by 2, which is true. Now we move on to the inductive step. Let all k be elements of n. If the inductive hypothesis P of k is true, we have the sum from 1-k is equal k multiplying k plus 1 divided by 2. Then the sum from 1-k plus 1 can be rewritten as follows, k multiplying k plus 1 divided by 2 plus k plus 1, which can be simplified to k plus 1 multiplying k plus 1 plus 1 divided by 2 which verifies that P of k plus 1 is true. We may also use mathematical induction to prove an inequality that holds for all positive integers greater than a particular positive integer. For instance, let's consider proving the propositional function P of n, 3 to the power of n is less than n factorial. If n is an integer greater than or equal to 7. In this example, the basis step P of 7 reduces to 3 to the power of 7 is less than 7 factorial, because 2187 is less than 5,040. Now we move on to the inductive step. Let k be an element of n and k greater or equal to 7. If the inductive hypothesis P of k is true, then 3 to the power of k plus 1, which is equal to 3 multiplying 3 to the power of k, is less than k plus 1 multiplying k factorial which is equal to k plus 1 factorial, which verifies that P of k plus 1 is true. We may also use mathematical induction to prove a divisibility that holds for all positive integers greater than a particular positive integer. Let's consider proving the propositional function P of n for all n in n, 6 to the power of n plus 4 is divisible by 5. The basic step in this example, P of 0 reduces to 6 to the power of 0 plus 4 is divisible by 5, because 6 to the power of 0 plus 4 is equal 5. Now we move on to the inductive step. Let k be an element of N. If the inductive hypothesis P of k is true, then 6 to the power of k plus 4 is equal 5p, where p is an element of N. By using the induction hypothesis, 6 to the power of k plus 1 plus 4 can be rewritten as 5 multiplying 6p minus 4, which is divisible by 5 and verifies that p of k plus 1 is true. Let's consider the statements of the following incorrect induction. P of n for all n in n, the sum from i equals 0 to n minus 1 of 2 to the power of i is equal 2 to the power of n. Let k be an element of n. Let's suppose the inductive hypothesis, P of k is true, which means the sum from i equals 0 to k minus 1 of 2 to the power of i is equal 2 to the power of k. Now, let's examine P of k plus 1. The sum from i equals 0 to k of 2 to the power of i is equal to the sum from i equals 0 to k minus 1 of 2 to the power of i, plus 2 to the power of k, which is equal to 2 to the power of k plus 2 to the power of k, which is equal to 2 of the power of k plus 1. This means that P of k plus 1 is also true and verifies the induction step. Even though we have been able to prove the induction step, let's prove that the statement P of n is simply false. For example, 2 to the power of 0 plus 2 to the power of 1 is equal 3, which is different from 2 to the power of 2. Our reasoning seemed correct because we haven't verified the base case and have made false assumptions. In other words, as we saw in propositional logic, false assumptions imply false conclusions. To avoid this situation, we need to make sure both the base case and the inductive step are verified. In this lecture, we discussed prove by induction. We began by looking at how induction can be used to prove formulas inequalities and the divisibility. Finally, we worked through an example of an incorrect induction. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Video: Video Introduction to proofs .

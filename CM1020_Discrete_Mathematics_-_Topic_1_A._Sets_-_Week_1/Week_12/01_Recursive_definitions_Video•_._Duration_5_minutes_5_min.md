Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Recursive definitions are used to define mathematical objects in terms of themselves. A recursively defined function f with domain n has two steps: basis step and recursive step. The basis step specifies an initial value of the function, while the recursive step provides a rule for finding the value of the function at an integer from its values at smaller integers.

For example, the sequence aN can be defined as 4n, 4^n, or 4 with different definitions. A set S can also be defined recursively by specifying initial elements and providing a rule for constructing new elements from those already in the set.

Algorithms are finite sequences of precise instructions for performing computations or solving problems. An algorithm is called recursive if it solves a problem by reducing it to an instance of the same problem with smaller inputs. For example, n factorial can be recursively defined as 0! = 1 and n! = n * (n-1)!, where n is a non-negative integer.

Recursive definitions are used in mathematics to define complex objects such as functions, sequences, and sets. They provide a way to break down problems into smaller instances of the same problem, making it easier to solve them. The key concepts in this lecture include recursive definitions, basis steps, recursive steps, and algorithms with recursion.

The formulas and technical details used in this lecture include:

* aN = 4n (sequence)
* aN = 4^n (sequence)
* aN = 4 (sequence)
* S = {x | x is an integer such that x = 4y for some integer y} (set)

The key concepts and findings of this lecture are:

* Recursive definitions provide a way to define complex objects in terms of themselves.
* Basis steps and recursive steps are used to define recursive functions, sequences, and sets.
* Algorithms with recursion can be used to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller instances of the same problem.

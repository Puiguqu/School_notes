Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key In this lecture, we will discuss recursive definitions. First, we will introduce the concept of recursion. Then, we will look at recursively defined functions, recursively defined sets, and recursive algorithms and examine some examples of each case. Sometimes, it's difficult to define a mathematical object. For example, a function, sequence or set explicitly. It can be easier to define an object in terms of the object itself. This process is called recursion. A recursively defined function f with domain n is a function defined by the following two steps. First, the basis step in which we specify an initial value of the function. Second the recursive step, in which we give a rule for finding the value of a function at an integer from its values at smaller integers. Such definition is called recursive or inductive definition. Defining a function f of n from the set n to the set r, is the same as a sequence a0, a1 and so on. Where all i are elements in n and ai are elements of r. Now let's give a recursive definition of the sequence aN. In the following cases aN equals 4n, aN equals four to the power of n and aN equals four. There may be more than one correct answer to each sequence. In the first sequence, as each term in the sequence is greater than the previous term by four. This sequence can be defined by setting a1 equals four and declaring that all n are greater than, or equal to one. An plus one equals four plus aN. In the second sequence, as each term is four times its predecessor, the sequence can be defined as a1 equals four. For all n greater than, or equal to one, aN plus one equals 4aN. The third sequence can be defined as a1 equals four and for all n, greater than or equal to one, aN plus one, equals aN. Sets can also be defined recursively, to do this we need to define two steps. First, the basis step in which we specify some initial elements. Second, the recursive step in which we provide a rule for constructing new elements from those we already have. For instance, consider the subset S of the set of integers recursively defined by basis step, four is an element of S. A recursive step. If x is an element of S, and y is an element of S, then x plus y is an element of S. Later, we will see how it can be proved that the set S is the set of all positive integers that are multiples of four. Now, let's move on to examine recursive algorithms. But first, let's define an algorithm. An algorithm, is a finite sequence of precise instructions for performing the computation or for solving a problem. An algorithm is called recursive if it solves a problem by reducing it to an instance of the same problem with smaller inputs. Let's look at an example of a recursive algorithm for computing n factorial, where n is a non-negative integer. N factorial can be recursively defined by the following two steps. First, the basis step where zero factorial equals one. Second, the recursive step where n factorial equals n multiplied by n minus 1 factorial, when n is a positive integer. The pseudo code of these algorithms can be formalized as follows: In this lecture, we discussed recursive definitions. We began by introducing recursion then, we present recursively defined functions, recursively defined sets, and recursive algorithms, and looked at some examples of each case. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 6.2 Recursion Video: Video Recursive definitions .

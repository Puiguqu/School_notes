Introduction In this topic we covered the concept of recursive definitions as well as mathematical proofs. Below contains a summary of the key elements of recursive definitions as well as a description of different mathematical proofs discussed in this topic. Recursive definitions In this topic we covered the concept of recursive definitions, their applications, and how they are used to define sequences and sets in discrete mathematics. Here are the key points summarised from the lesson: Key Concepts Recursive Definitions: Base Case: The simplest instance of the object being defined, providing the initial value. Recursive Step: A rule that defines the object in terms of itself, specifying how to derive new elements from existing ones. Applications: Recursively Defined Functions: Functions that are defined by specifying initial values (base case) and a rule for computing the function's value from previous values (recursive step). Recursively Defined Sets: Sets that are defined by specifying initial elements (base case) and rules for generating new elements from those already in the set (recursive step). Below is an example of a recursive function, Fibonacci Sequence: Example 1: Fibonacci Sequence: Base Case: F(0)=0,F(1)=1 Recursive Step: F(n)=F(n−1)+F(n−2) for n>1 Mathematical proofs Logical arguments that establish the truth of mathematical statements. Proofs are essential in mathematics and computer science for validating the correctness of algorithms, theorems, and various mathematical concepts. Here is a detailed summary of the key aspects of mathematical proofs: There are different types of proof: direct proof, indirect proof (proof by contradiction). proof by contrapositive and induction proof. A selection of a proof depends on the problem we are trying to solve. section describes each one of these methods with an example. Direct proof A direct proof establishes the truth of a given statement by straightforward logical deduction from known facts or axioms. The proof proceeds from the premises to the conclusion in a logical sequence. Example 2: Prove that the sum of two even numbers is even. Solution 1: Proof: Let a and b be two even numbers and show that (a+b) is also an even number. By definition, a and b be two even numbers means there exist integers k and m such that a=2k and b=2m. Then, a+b=2k+2m=2(k+m). Since k+m is an integer, a+b is even. Proof by contradiction An indirect proof (proof by contradiction) establishes the truth of a given statement by showing that assuming the statement is false leads to a contradiction. Example 3: Prove by contradiction that 2 is irrational. Solution 2: Proof: Assume, for contradiction, that 2 is rational. Then, 2 = q p for some integers p and q with gcd(p,q)=1. Squaring both sides, we get 2= q 2 p 2 ⟹2q 2 =p 2 . This implies that p 2 is even, so p must be even. Let p=2k. Substituting, we get 2q 2 =(2k) 2 =4k 2 ⟹q 2 =2k 2 . This implies that q 2 is even, so q must be even. However, this contradicts our assumption that gcd(p,q)=1. Therefore, 2 is irrational. Proof by contrapositive Proof by contrapositive is a method of proving a conditional statement of the form ''if P, then Q'' by proving the equivalent statement ''if not Q, then not P''. The contrapositive of a statement is always logically equivalent to the original statement. Steps in proof by contrapositive Restate the contrapositive: Convert the original statement ''if P, then Q'' into its contrapositive form ''if not Q, then not P''. Assume the negation of the conclusion: Assume that Q is false. Prove the negation of the hypothesis: Show that under this assumption, P must also be false. Conclude the original statement is true: Since the contrapositive is true, the original statement must also be true. Example 4: Prove that if n 2 is even, then n is even. Solution 3: The contrapositive of the statement is: if n is not even (i.e., n is odd), then n 2 is not even (i.e., n 2 is odd). Assume that n is odd. Then n can be written as n=2k+1 for some integer k. Squaring both sides, we get n 2 =(2k+1) 2 =4k 2 +4k+1=2(2k 2 +2k)+1. This expression is of the form 2m+1, which is odd. Therefore, if n is odd, then n 2 is odd. This proves the contrapositive, and thus, the original statement is true. Proof by induction Proof by induction is a method of proving statements about natural numbers by showing that if the statement holds for a particular case, it holds for the next case, and then proving it holds for the first case. Example 5: Prove that for all n∈N, the sum of the first n positive integers is given by 1+2+⋯+n= 2 n(n+1) . Solution: Proof: Base case: For n=1, 1= 2 1(1+1) =1. Inductive step: Assume the statement is true for n=k, i.e., 1+2+⋯+k= 2 k(k+1) . We need to show it holds for n=k+1: 1+2+⋯+k+(k+1)= 2 k(k+1) +(k+1). Simplifying, = 2 k(k+1)+2(k+1) = 2 (k+1)(k+2) . Thus, by the principle of mathematical induction, the statement is true for all n∈N. Constructive proof: A constructive proof demonstrates the existence of a mathematical object by constructing an example. Example: Prove that there exists a positive integer that is both even and a perfect square. Proof: Consider the number 4. It is an even number and can be written as 2 2 , which is a perfect square. Therefore, such a number exists. Non-constructive proof: A non-constructive proof demonstrates the existence of a mathematical object without necessarily providing a specific example. Example: Prove that there exist irrational numbers a and b such that a b is rational. Proof: Consider the number 2 2 . If this number is rational, we are done. If it is irrational, consider ( 2 2 ) 2 = 2 2 =2, which is rational. Thus, in either case, such irrational numbers a and b exist. Conclusion Mathematical proofs are a cornerstone of mathematics and computer science, providing a solid foundation for verifying the truth of statements and the correctness of algorithms. Understanding different proof techniques is essential for solving complex problems and advancing knowledge in these fields. As you progress through your course, it is crucial to regularly assess your understanding and capabilities against the learning outcomes.

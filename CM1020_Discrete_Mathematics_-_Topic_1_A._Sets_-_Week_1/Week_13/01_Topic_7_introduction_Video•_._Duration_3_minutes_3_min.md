Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences:

Graph theory is an area of discrete mathematics that studies configurations called graphs, involving sets of vertices interconnected with edges. A graph is a discrete structure consisting of vertices or nodes and edges connecting them. Graphs can be used to model real-world problems, such as computer networks, roadmaps, shortest path problems between cities, and assigning jobs to employees in an organization.

The first problem in graph theory was the Seven Bridges of Konigsberg problem, which was solved by Leonhard Euler in 1735. Euler showed that it is impossible to take a walk and cross all seven bridges only once using a specific graph model. Graphs can be used to represent real-world problems as a set of vertices and edges, where each vertex represents an item or location, and each edge represents a connection between them.

Graph theory has many applications in various disciplines, including computer science, chemistry, and physics. It can be used to distinguish chemical compounds' structures, model molecules, and gain insight into physical properties of chemical compounds. The gas butane can be represented by a graph structure where the carbon items are vertices and the chemical bonds are edges.

In this lecture, an informal definition of graphs was given, and real-world applications of graph theory were discussed. Graph theory is used to create abstraction from real-world problems that can be understood and manipulated by computers. Computer scientists use graph models to design computer circuits, schedule final exams, and solve other complex problems. The next lesson will discuss graphs in more detail.

Key concepts such as walks, paths, and circuits in graph theory were also discussed. Graphs have various types of edges, including dry land (vertices) and bridges (edges). The degree sequence of a graph refers to the number of edges connected to each vertex. Special graphs, such as simple, r-regular, and complete graphs, were also introduced.

Overall, graph theory is a fundamental area of discrete mathematics that provides a powerful tool for solving complex problems in various disciplines.

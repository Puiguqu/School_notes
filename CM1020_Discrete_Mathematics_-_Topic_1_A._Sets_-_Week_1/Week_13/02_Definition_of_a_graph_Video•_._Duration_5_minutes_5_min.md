Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

A graph is a discrete structure consisting of vertices and edges connecting them. A graph G can be represented by a pair VE, where V is a set of nodes (vertices) and E is a set of edges. The set of vertices of a graph G is usually denoted by V(G) or just V. An edge is a link between two vertices, drawn as a line connecting them. The set of edges in a graph G is usually denoted by E(G) or just E. Two vertices are said to be adjacent if they are endpoints of the same edge, and two edges are said to be adjacent if they share the same vertex.

The adjacency of vertices can be defined using the concept of incident edges, where an edge e and a vertex v are said to be incident if v is an endpoint of e. A directed graph, or digraph, is a graph in which the edges have a direction, indicated by an arrow on the edge. In this lecture, we defined what a graph is, annotated its basic elements (vertices and edges), explained the concept of adjacency, and introduced directed graphs.

The definition of a graph can be formalized as follows: a graph G = (V, E) consists of a set V of vertices and a set E of edges. A vertex v is said to be adjacent to another vertex u if there exists an edge e such that v and u are endpoints of e. An edge e is said to be incident on a vertex v if v is an endpoint of e. The degree sequence of a graph G refers to the sequence of degrees of all vertices in G.

Special types of graphs include simple graphs, r-regular graphs, and complete graphs. Simple graphs have no multiple edges or loops, while r-regular graphs have exactly r edges incident on each vertex. Complete graphs are graphs in which every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge. These concepts form the foundation of graph theory, a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of graphs and their properties.

The video lectures cover these topics in detail, including the definition of a graph, walks and paths in a graph, circuits in a graph, and special graphs such as simple, r-regular, and complete graphs. The practice assignments provide opportunities for students to apply their knowledge and reinforce their understanding of these concepts.

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving all key information, formulae, and technical details:

1. A graph can be represented using its degree sequence, which is a sequence of the degree of each vertex in descending order.
2. The degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it, with loops contributing twice to the degree and isolated vertices having a degree of 0.
3. In directed graphs, there are two types of degrees: out-degree (number of edges that start at the vertex) and in-degree (number of edges that end at the vertex).
4. The degree sequence is defined as a list of the degrees of all vertices in the graph, separated by commas.
5. One property of the degree sequence is that its sum is always even, which means it's impossible to construct a graph with an odd sum.
6. Another property is that the sum of the degree sequence is twice the number of edges in the graph, making the number of edges equal to half the sum of the degree sequence.
7. This relationship can be expressed mathematically as: ∑deg(v) = 2|E|, where ∑deg(v) is the sum of the degrees and |E| is the number of edges.
8. The degree sequence provides a way to describe a graph without explicitly drawing its edges or vertices.
9. It's possible to construct graphs with certain degree sequences by starting with an empty graph and adding edges until the desired degree distribution is achieved.
10. For example, given a degree sequence 3,2,2,1, it's possible to construct a graph with 4 vertices, where each vertex has the specified degree.
11. However, other degree sequences, like 3,3,2,1, are impossible to construct because their sum is odd.
12. The degree sequence can be used to analyze and understand properties of graphs, such as connectivity and clustering coefficients.
13. By analyzing the degree sequence, we can infer information about the graph's structure and behavior.
14. The concept of the degree sequence is a fundamental aspect of graph theory, providing a concise way to describe complex networks.
15. It has numerous applications in fields like computer science, physics, biology, and social network analysis, among others.

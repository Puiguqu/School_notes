Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences:

Graph theory is an area of discrete mathematics that studies configurations called graphs, involving sets of vertices interconnected with edges. A graph is a discrete structure consisting of vertices or nodes and edges connecting them. Graphs can be used to model real-world problems, such as computer networks, roadmaps, shortest path problems between cities, and assigning jobs to employees in an organization.

The first problem in graph theory was the Seven Bridges of Konigsberg problem, which was solved by Leonhard Euler in 1735. Euler showed that it is impossible to take a walk and cross all seven bridges only once using a specific graph model. Graphs can be used to represent real-world problems as a set of vertices and edges, where each vertex represents an item or location, and each edge represents a connection between them.

Graph theory has many applications in various disciplines, including computer science, chemistry, and physics. It can be used to distinguish chemical compounds' structures, model molecules, and gain insight into physical properties of chemical compounds. The gas butane can be represented by a graph structure where the carbon items are vertices and the chemical bonds are edges.

In this lecture, an informal definition of graphs was given, and real-world applications of graph theory were discussed. Graph theory is used to create abstraction from real-world problems that can be understood and manipulated by computers. Computer scientists use graph models to design computer circuits, schedule final exams, and solve other complex problems. The next lesson will discuss graphs in more detail.

Key concepts such as walks, paths, and circuits in graph theory were also discussed. Graphs have various types of edges, including dry land (vertices) and bridges (edges). The degree sequence of a graph refers to the number of edges connected to each vertex. Special graphs, such as simple, r-regular, and complete graphs, were also introduced.

Overall, graph theory is a fundamental area of discrete mathematics that provides a powerful tool for solving complex problems in various disciplines.

## Definition of a graph

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

A graph is a discrete structure consisting of vertices and edges connecting them. A graph G can be represented by a pair VE, where V is a set of nodes (vertices) and E is a set of edges. The set of vertices of a graph G is usually denoted by V(G) or just V. An edge is a link between two vertices, drawn as a line connecting them. The set of edges in a graph G is usually denoted by E(G) or just E. Two vertices are said to be adjacent if they are endpoints of the same edge, and two edges are said to be adjacent if they share the same vertex.

The adjacency of vertices can be defined using the concept of incident edges, where an edge e and a vertex v are said to be incident if v is an endpoint of e. A directed graph, or digraph, is a graph in which the edges have a direction, indicated by an arrow on the edge. In this lecture, we defined what a graph is, annotated its basic elements (vertices and edges), explained the concept of adjacency, and introduced directed graphs.

The definition of a graph can be formalized as follows: a graph G = (V, E) consists of a set V of vertices and a set E of edges. A vertex v is said to be adjacent to another vertex u if there exists an edge e such that v and u are endpoints of e. An edge e is said to be incident on a vertex v if v is an endpoint of e. The degree sequence of a graph G refers to the sequence of degrees of all vertices in G.

Special types of graphs include simple graphs, r-regular graphs, and complete graphs. Simple graphs have no multiple edges or loops, while r-regular graphs have exactly r edges incident on each vertex. Complete graphs are graphs in which every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge. These concepts form the foundation of graph theory, a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of graphs and their properties.

The video lectures cover these topics in detail, including the definition of a graph, walks and paths in a graph, circuits in a graph, and special graphs such as simple, r-regular, and complete graphs. The practice assignments provide opportunities for students to apply their knowledge and reinforce their understanding of these concepts.

## Walks and paths in a graph

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving all key information, formulae, and technical details:

A walk in a graph is a sequence of vertices and edges where vertices and edges can be repeated. A walk of length k in a graph is a succession of k edges that are not necessarily different. A trail is a walk in which no edge is repeated, while a circuit is a closed trail with repeated vertices only.

A path is a trail in which neither vertices nor edges are repeated, and the length of a path is equal to the number of edges it contains. A cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex. An Eulerian path visits each edge of a graph exactly once, while a Hamiltonian path visits each vertex of a graph exactly once.

A strongly connected digraph has a directed path between all pairs of vertices, while a connected undirected graph has a path connecting any two nodes. The transitive closure of a digraph G is the digraph G* that contains a directed edge from U to V if there exists a directed path from U to V in G.

A simple graph has no multiple edges between any pair of vertices, an r-regular graph has exactly r edges incident on each vertex, and a complete graph has an edge between every pair of vertices. The degree sequence of a graph is the sequence of degrees of its vertices. Understanding these concepts is essential for studying graph theory and its applications in computer science and other fields.

A digraph can be classified into different types based on its connectivity properties, such as strongly connected or weakly connected graphs. The transitive closure provides reachability information about a digraph, allowing us to determine whether there exists a directed path between two vertices.

## The degree sequence of a graph

. Duration: 8 minutes

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving all key information, formulae, and technical details:

1. A graph can be represented using its degree sequence, which is a sequence of the degree of each vertex in descending order.
2. The degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it, with loops contributing twice to the degree and isolated vertices having a degree of 0.
3. In directed graphs, there are two types of degrees: out-degree (number of edges that start at the vertex) and in-degree (number of edges that end at the vertex).
4. The degree sequence is defined as a list of the degrees of all vertices in the graph, separated by commas.
5. One property of the degree sequence is that its sum is always even, which means it's impossible to construct a graph with an odd sum.
6. Another property is that the sum of the degree sequence is twice the number of edges in the graph, making the number of edges equal to half the sum of the degree sequence.
7. This relationship can be expressed mathematically as: ∑deg(v) = 2|E|, where ∑deg(v) is the sum of the degrees and |E| is the number of edges.
8. The degree sequence provides a way to describe a graph without explicitly drawing its edges or vertices.
9. It's possible to construct graphs with certain degree sequences by starting with an empty graph and adding edges until the desired degree distribution is achieved.
10. For example, given a degree sequence 3,2,2,1, it's possible to construct a graph with 4 vertices, where each vertex has the specified degree.
11. However, other degree sequences, like 3,3,2,1, are impossible to construct because their sum is odd.
12. The degree sequence can be used to analyze and understand properties of graphs, such as connectivity and clustering coefficients.
13. By analyzing the degree sequence, we can infer information about the graph's structure and behavior.
14. The concept of the degree sequence is a fundamental aspect of graph theory, providing a concise way to describe complex networks.
15. It has numerous applications in fields like computer science, physics, biology, and social network analysis, among others.

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Graph theory is a fundamental area of discrete mathematics with applications in computer science, biology, sociology, and many other fields. A walk in a graph is an alternating sequence of vertices and edges, starting and ending with a vertex, where vertices and edges can be repeated. A walk can be represented as: v0, e1, v1, e2, ..., ek, vk where vi = (vi−1, vi) for i = 1, 2, ..., k. Examples of walks include sequences that start and end at a vertex, passing through another vertex, such as (a, b), b, (b, d), d, (d, a), a. A walk can also be a sequence that starts and ends at the same vertex, visiting each edge exactly once, such as (a, b), b, (b, d), d, (d, a), a. A path is a walk in which all vertices and edges are distinct. Formally, a path from vertex u to vertex v can be represented as: u = v0, e1, v1, e2, ..., ek, vk = v where vi ≠ vj for all i ≠ j. This ensures that a path does not revisit any vertex. An example of a path from a to d is: a, (a, b), b, (b, d), d. A circuit is a walk that starts and ends at the same vertex, with all edges distinct. Formally, a circuit can be represented as: v0, e1, v1, e2, ..., ek, vk = v0 where vi ≠ vj for all i ≠ j except vi = vk. Understanding walks, paths, and circuits is essential in various applications, including Network Routing and Social Networks. Graph theory provides the foundation for more advanced topics and applications, such as special graphs like simple, r-regular, and complete graphs.

Graph theory is an essential concept in various fields, including computer science and engineering. A graph is defined as a set of vertices connected by edges, where each edge has a label or weight associated with it. The degree sequence of a graph refers to the number of edges incident on each vertex. Simple graphs have no multiple edges between any two vertices, while regular graphs have equal degrees for all vertices. Complete graphs are those where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge. Graphs also include paths and circuits, which are sequences of edges connecting vertices in a specific order. The degree sequence of a graph can be used to determine its properties and behavior. In the context of graph theory, simple, regular, and complete graphs have important applications in computer science, engineering, and other fields.

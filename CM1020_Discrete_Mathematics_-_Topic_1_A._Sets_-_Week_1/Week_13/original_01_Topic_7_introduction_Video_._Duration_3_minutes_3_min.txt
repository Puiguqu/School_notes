Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key This lecture is an introduction to graph theory. First, we will give an informal definition of a graph. We will then discuss applications and origins of graph theory. Computer science is a science of abstraction. Computer scientist must create abstraction of real-world problem that can be represented, understood, and manipulated by a computer. For instance, logic is used to design a computer circuits. Another example is scheduling of final exams. For successful scheduling, we have to take into account associations between courses, students, and rooms. Such set of associations or connections between items can be modeled by graphs. So what is a graph? Graphs are discrete structure consisting of vertices or nodes and edges connecting them. Graph theory is an area in discrete mathematics which studies configurations called graphs, involving set of vertices interconnected with edges. The first problem in graph theory was the Seven Bridges of Konigsberg problem solved by Leonhard Euler in 1735. Two islands are connected to each other by seven bridges. The question asked was whether or not it was possible to take walk and cross all the seven bridges only once? In a paper published in 1736, Leonhard Euler show that this is impossible. He explained that using a graph in which a dry land is represented by vertices whereas bridges are represented by edges. You can solve problems using graph models in a variety of disciplines. This problems might be for instance, modeling computer networks, or modeling roadmaps, solving shortest path problems between cities, or assigning jobs to employees in an organization. Graph theory can also be used for distinguishing chemical compounds structures, modeling molecules using graphs can be useful in order to gain insight into physical properties of chemical compounds. For instance, the gas butane, an organic compound with four carbon items can be represented by the following graph structure, where the items are the vertices and the chemical bonds are the edges. In this lecture, we gave an informal definition of graphs and discussed the origin of graph theory. We also looked at a few real-world application where graph theory is used. In the next lesson, we will discuss graphs in more details. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Video: Video Topic 7 introduction .

Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key In this lecture, we will cover the following. First, we will consider the definition of a graph. Then we will look at formal definitions of graphs, vertices, edges, and their adjacency, and explains this concept using examples. We will also be taking a look at loops and parallel edges. Finally, we will conclude by looking at directed graphs. So what is a graph? Graphs are discrete structures consisting of vertices and edges connecting. Let's take a look at a more formal definition of a graph. A graph G can be represented by a pair VE, where V is a set of nodes or vertices and E is a set of edges, lines or connections. Let's now define what vertex is. Vertices are the basic elements of a graph that are usually drawn as nodes or just a dot. The set of vertices of a graph G is usually denoted by V of G or just V. For instance, the following graph comprises three vertices v1, v2, and v3. Let's now define what an edge is, it is a link between two vertices. It is drawn as a line connecting two vertices. The set of edges in a graph G is usually denoted by E(g) or just E. For instance, the following graph has two edges, e1 and e2. Let's now define what adjacency means. Two vertices are said to be adjacent if they are endpoints of the same age. Two edges are said to be adjacent if they share the same vertex. If a vertex v is an endpoint of an edge e, then we say the e and v incident. Let's consider the following graph. It comprises the set of vertices V, which contains the vertices v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, and v6. And the set of edges E, which contain the edges e1, e2, e3, e4, e5, e6, and e7. v1 and v2 are and points of the edge e1. We say that v1 and v2 are adjacent. The edges e1 and e7 share the same vertex v1. We say that e1 and e7 are adjacent. The vertex v2 is an endpoint of the edge e1. We say that e1 and v2 are incident. Let's consider the following graph, v2 and v5 are linked with two edges, e6 and e8. e6 and e8 are called parallel edges. The vertex v1 is linked to itself by the edge e9. The edge e9 is called a loop. A directed graph, also called a digraph, is a graph in which the edges have a direction. This is usually indicated by an arrow on the edge. Given the graph shown e1 is a connection from v1 to v2, but not from v2 to v1. e6 is a connection from v2 to v5 whereas e8 is a connection from the v5 to v2. In this lecture, we defined what a graph is, annotated that the basic elements of a graph are vertices and edges. We also explained what it means to say that two vertices or two edges are adjacent. Finally, we introduce directed graphs. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Video: Video Topic 7 introduction . Duration: 3 minutes 3 min Discussion Prompt: Graph theory .

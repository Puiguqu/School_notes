Let's begin by examining walk case. A walk is a sequence of vertices and edges of a graph where vertices and edges can be repeated. A walk of length k in a graph is a succession of k edges which are not necessarily different. For example, let's look at the following graph. There is a walk from V1 to V2, to V3, and V3 to V4, and from V4 to V6. As you can see, it's the edge E1 followed by E2, followed by E3, followed by E4. There are four edges in this walk. We can say that this is a walk of length 4, and this walk is from V1 to V6. The graph given in this example shows a walk of length 4 from the vertex V1 to the vertex V5, which passes twice through the edge E2. A trail is a walk in which no edge is repeated. Hence in a trail, vertices can be repeated but no edge is ever repeated. The following graph shows the walk E1 followed by E2, followed by E3, followed by E5, and followed by E6 in red. As you can see, no edge is repeated. Hence, this walk is a trail. A circuit is a closed trail. Circuits can have repeated vertices only. For example, trail E7 followed by the edge E6, followed by E8, followed by E3, followed by E2, and followed by E1 represented in red is a closed trail. Hence, it is a circuit. A path is a trail in which neither vertices nor edges are repeated. The length of a path is given by the number of edges it contains. Now let's consider the following graph. The walk V1-V2, V2-V3, V3-V2, V2-V5 denoted by the edge E1 followed by E2, followed by E2, followed by E6, or vertex V1 followed by vertex V2, followed by the vertex V3, followed by V2, and finally the vertex V5 is a walk of length 4 from V1 to V5, and is not a path because the edge E2 is repeated. Now consider the walk from V1 to V6 containing the following edges; E1 followed by E2, followed by E3, followed by E4. No edge or vertex is repeated. Hence, this is a path. The length of this path is four as it contains for ages. A cycle is a closed path consisting of edges and vertices, where the vertex is reachable from itself. Consider the following graph in which the walk V1-V2, V2-V5, V5-V1 denoted by the edge E1 followed by E2, followed by E3 constitutes a closed path of length three from V1 to V5. The residents of Königsberg, Germany wonder if it was possible to take a walk through the town and cross each of the seven bridges over the river exactly once. In other words, is there a walk that passes each of the seven bridges once? In 1736, Leonhard Euler proved that the walk was not possible. He proved this by inventing a diagram called a network made up of vertices linked with lines. This was the birth of graph theory. Euler showed that in this case, there exists no walk that crosses each edge once and once only. A path in a graph is called Eulerian path if and only if it uses each edge of the graph precisely once. A graph containing an Eulerian path is called a traversable graph. For example, given the following graph, we can clearly see that the path formed by the edge E2 followed by the edge E4, followed by E6, followed by E7, followed by E5, then followed by E3, and finally E1, which is just the path from the vertex V1 to V3, then to V4, V5, and vertex V2, and vertex V4, V1, and V2 is an Eulerian path as it traverses each edge of the graph once, hence this graph is traversable. A Hamiltonian path is a path that visits each vertex of a graph exactly once. The red line in the graph below shows a Hamiltonian path as it passes each vertex once and once only. A graph that contains a Hamiltonian path is called a traceable graph. A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once, except for the starting vertex which is visited once at the start and once again at the end. For example, the graph G2 given here shows a closed path that passes through every edge of the graph G1, hence G2 is a Hamiltonian cycle of the graph G1. A graph containing a Hamiltonian cycle is called a Hamiltonian graph. Now, let's talk about graph connectivity. An undirected graph is connected if you can get from any node to any other node by following a sequence of edges, or in other words, any two nodes are connected by a path. For instance, the following graph is an example of a connected graph. We can clearly see that if you take any two nodes of this graph, you can find a path connecting them. However, given the following graph, we can clearly see that there is no path from the vertices V1, V2, or V5 to the vertices of V3 or V4. Hence, this is not a connected graph. A directed graph is a strongly connected diagraph if and only if there exists a directed path between all pairs of vertices. Given the following graph, we can clearly see that there exists a directed path between any two vertices. Hence, this is a strongly connected graph. Now take a look at the following example. This graph has no directed path from V4 to any of the other vertices. This means that this graph is not strongly connected directed graph. Given a digraph G, the transitive closure of G is the digraph G star, where G star has the same number of vertices as G. Also, if there is a directed path from a vertex U to a vertex V, where U is different from V, then there is a directed edge from U to V. For example, given the following graph G, we can clearly see that there are four directed paths. The first one is the path X-Z-U. Hence, the transitive closure graph of G contains a directed edge from X to U. The second one is the path X-Z-U-V. Hence, the transitive closure of G contains a directed edge from X to V. The third one is the path Z-U-V. Hence, the transitive closure of G contains a directed edge from Z to V. Finally, there is a directed path Y-U-V. Hence, the transitive closure of G contains a directed edge from Y to V. The transitive closure provides reachability information about a digraph. In this lesson, we covered the following; the difference between a walk, a trail, a circuit, a path, and a cycle, a Euler path, a Hamiltonian path and Hamiltonian cycle, connected graphs and strongly connected digraphs. Finally, we talked about the transitive closure of a graph. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Video: Video Topic 7 introduction .

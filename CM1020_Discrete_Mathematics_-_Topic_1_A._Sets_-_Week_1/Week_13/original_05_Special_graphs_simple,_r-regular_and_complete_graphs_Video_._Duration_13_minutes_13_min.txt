Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key In this lecture, we will cover the following. First, we will define what a simple graph is. Then we will investigate the concept of regular graphs. Finally, we will give a definition of a complete graph and show some of its properties. Let's start by giving a definition of a simple graph. A simple graph is a graph which contains no loops and no parallel edges. The graph G1 contains no loops and no parallel edges, hence G1 is a simple graph. However, G2 contains parallel edges. Therefore, G2 is not a simple graph. Similarly, the graph G3 is not simple graph as it contains a loop. Let's take a look at some examples of simple graphs. As you can see, none of these graphs contains a loop or parallel edges. Given a simple graph G with n vertices, the degree of each vertex of G is at most equal to n minus 1. Let's prove it. Let v be a vertex of G such that the degree of v is greater than n minus 1. However, we have only n minus 1 other vertices for v to be connected to. Hence, the other connections can only be a result of parallel edges or loops. Here is an example of a simple graph with four vertices. As you can see, the vertex A has a degree of three as it is connected to the other three vertices. If we add one more connection to A, it will either be from a loop or a parallel edge. Let's now try to answer the following question about a simple graph. Can we draw a simple graph with the following degree sequences? Four, two, two, two or the degree sequence 4,3,3,2,2. Pause the video now and have a go. In both cases, the sum of the degree sequence is even. Hence we can construct a graph. But can it be simple? Let's look at the first degree sequence 4,2,2,2. Although we can construct a graph with this degree sequence, it cannot be simple. The reason for it is one of the vertex has degree four. However, there are only three other vertices to be connected to. Therefore, the remaining connection can only be as a result of a loop or parallel edge. For the second degree sequence, the 4,3,3,2,2, yes we can construct a simple graph with this degree sequence and the graph is as below. So this is degree four, degree three, degree three, degree two, and degree two. Let's look at the first example, the degree sequence 4,2,2,2. The sum of the degree sequence is equal to 4 plus 2 plus 2 plus 2 which is 10, which is an even number. Therefore, you can construct a graph with this degree sequence, but can be simple? Let's try to construct this graph. One of the vertices has got four or four edge degree. Let's assume this vertex has got four. However, there are only three other vertices to connect to. Therefore, the other connection can only come from either a loop or a parallel edge. Therefore, we can't construct a simple graph with this degree sequence. Now, let's look at the second degree sequence; 4,3,3,2,2. The sum of the degree sequence is even as well. So it's 4 plus 3 plus 3 plus 2 plus 2 which is 14, which is an even number. Therefore, we can construct a graph with this degree sequence. This graph has got five vertices and the highest degree is four, then it is possible to construct a simple graph with this degree sequence. So let's try to draw this graph. We've got five vertices, okay? Five vertices. So if we draw this, this, this and put this here and put another connection from this and another connection to this vertex. So we got a degree four, we got degree three, we got degree three, and we got degree two, and we got a degree two. Therefore, it is a simple graph with five vertices. Now let's define another type of graphs called regular graphs. A graph is said to be irregular if all vertices have the same number of neighbors and therefore, the same degree. A graph G where all the vertices have the same degree, r, is called an r-regular graph. Let's take a look at some examples of regular graphs. G1 is one regular graph with two vertices and a degree sequence of 1,1. G2 is two-regular graph with three vertices and a degree sequence of 2,2,2. G3 is a two-regular graph with four vertices and a degree sequence of 2,2,2,2. G4 is a three-regular graph with four vertices and a degree sequence of 3,3,3,3. Let's examine some properties of regular graphs. Let G be an r-regular graph with n vertices, then the following is true. The degree sequence of G is r, r, r n times. Therefore, the sum of the degree sequence of G is equal to just r times n. The number of edges in G is just r times n divided by 2. Now let's look at the following graph G. G has six vertices with the degree of each vertex is equal to three. G is therefore a three-regular graph with six vertices, and the degree sequence of G is therefore 3,3,3,3,3,3. Hence, the sum of the degree sequence of G is 3 times 6 which is 18. Therefore, the number of edges in the graph G is equal to 18 divided by 2 which is 9. Lets have a look at some cycles which are special cases of regular graphs. C3 is a two-regular graph with three vertices. C4 is a two-regular graph with four vertices. Whereas C5 is a two-regular graph with five vertices. The degree sequence of C3 is 2,2,2. The degree sequence of C4 is 2,2,2,2. Whereas the degree sequence of C5 is 2,2,2,2,2. Now, let's try to answer the following two questions about regular graphs. Can we construct a three-regular graph with four vertices? Can we construct a three-regular graph with five vertices? You can now pause the video and have a go. Let's look at the first case of three-regular graph with four vertices. The sum of the degree sequence in this case is equal to 3 times 4 which is 12, which is an even number. Therefore, you can construct a 3-regular graph with four vertices. Let's look at the second case of a three-regular graph with five vertices. The sum of the degree sequence in this case, if it's possible, is 3 times 5 which is 15, which is an odd number. Therefore, it is impossible to construct a three-regular graph with five vertices. Let's now examine a different type of graphs called complete graph. Complete graph is a simple graph where every pair of vertices are adjacent. In other words, they are linked with an edge. We represent a complete graph with n vertices using the symbol K_n. Here is some examples of complete graphs. A vertex on its own is a complete graph with one vertex. These two vertices connected to an edge is a complete graph with two vertices. A two-regular graph with three vertices is just a complete graph with three vertices, as between any two vertices you can find a direct link. A complete graph with four vertices is as below. This is a complete graph with five vertices, a complete graph with six vertices, a complete graph with seven vertices, and a complete graph with eight vertices. If you take any two vertices in any of these graphs, you can find a direct link between them. A complete graph with n vertices K_n has the following properties: every vertex has degree n minus 1, the sum of the degree sequence is equal to n times n minus 1, the number of edges is equal to n times n minus 1 divided by 2. Here is an example of a complete graph with five vertices, K_5. There are five vertices and the degree of each vertex is five minus 1 which is equal to 4. The sum of the degree sequence is 5 times 5 minus 1 which is 5 times 4 which is equal to 20. The number of ages is 5 times 5 minus 1 divide by 2 which is 20 divide by 2 which is equal to 10. If you count the number of edges in this graph, we should find 10 edges exactly. In this lesson, we looked at three types of graphs and their properties. First, we defined what simple graph is. Then we introduced regular graphs. Finally, we defined and examined the properties of a complete graph. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Video: Video Topic 7 introduction .

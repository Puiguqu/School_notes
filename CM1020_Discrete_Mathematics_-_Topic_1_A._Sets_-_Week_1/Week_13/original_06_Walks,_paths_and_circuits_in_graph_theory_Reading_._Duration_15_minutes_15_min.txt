Introduction Graph theory is a fundamental area of discrete mathematics, with applications in computer science, biology, sociology, and many other fields. In the following sections, we will define and explore three basic concepts in graph theory: walks, circuits and paths Walks A walk in a graph is an alternating sequence of vertices and edges, starting and ending with a vertex, where vertices and edges of a graph where vertices and edges can be repeated. Formally, a walk can be represented as: v 0 ,e 1 ,v 1 ,e 2 ,...,e k ,v k where v 0 ,v 1 ,...,v k are vertices and e 1 ,e 2 ,...,e k are edges such that e i =(v i −1,v i ) for i=1,2,...,k. In the graph above, examples of walks include: a,(a,b),b,(b,a),a: This walk starts and ends at vertex a, passing through vertex b and returning to a. Here, both vertices and edges are repeated. a,(a,b),b,(b,d),d,(d,a),a: This walk starts and ends at vertex a, passing through vertices b and d. Here, vertices are repeated but edges are not. a,(a,b),b,(b,d),d,(d,b),b: This walk starts at vertex a and ends at vertex b, passing through vertices b and d multiple times. Both vertices and edges are repeated. Path A path is a walk in which all vertices (and thus all edges) are distinct. Formally, a path from vertex u to vertex v is a sequence: u=v 0 ,e 1 ,v 1 ,e 2 ,...,e k ,v k =v where v i  =v j for all i  =j. This ensures that a path does not revisit any vertex. In the same graph, an example of a path from a to d is: a,(a,b),b,(b,d),d This path starts at a and ends at d without revisiting any vertices or edges. Circuit A circuit is a walk that starts and ends at the same vertex, with all edges distinct. Formally, a circuit can be represented as: v 0 ,e 1 ,v 1 ,e 2 ,...,e k ,v k =v 0 where v i  =v j for all i  =j except v 0 =v k . In the same graph, an example of a circuit starting and ending at vertex a is: a,(a,b),b,(b,d),d,(d,a),a This circuit visits each edge exactly once and returns to the starting vertex a. Conclusion Walks, paths, and circuits are fundamental concepts in graph theory, providing the foundation for more advanced topics and applications Understanding walks, paths, and circuits is essential in various applications: Network Routing: Finding efficient routes in communication networks or transportation systems. Social Networks: Analysing relationships and connections within social graphs. Video: Video Topic 7 introduction . Duration: 3 minutes 3 min Discussion Prompt: Graph theory .

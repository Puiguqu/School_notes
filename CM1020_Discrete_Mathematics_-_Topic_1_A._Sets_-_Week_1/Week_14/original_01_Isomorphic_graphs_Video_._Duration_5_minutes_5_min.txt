Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key In this lesson, we will discuss the concept of isomorphism in terms of graphs. First, we will define what it means to say that two graphs are isomorphic. Then, we will discuss some properties of isomorphic graphs. Let's begun by defining what it means to say that two graphs are isomorphic. Two graphs, G1 and G2 are isomorphic if there is a bijection which means, an invertible function F which maps all the vertices of G1 to vertices of G2 that preserve the adjacency are non-adjacency. So let U and V be two vertices in the graph G1. If uv is an edge in the graph G1, then f of u, f of v is an edge in the graph G2. This means that u and v are adjacent in G1 if and only if f of u and f of v are adjacent in the graph G2. Now that we have looked a formal definition of isomorphic graphs, let's examine some examples. The idea behind isomorphism is to show that two graphs even if they might look different, they are actually the same. Consider these two graphs, G1 and G2. They look similar, but how can we prove it formally? Let's map G1 to G2 as follow. Map a1 to b1, a2 to b2, a3 to b3, a4 to b4, and a5 to b5. Let's call this mapping of function f. If we remember, the definition of a bijective function from the earlier lectures on functions, we can see that the function f is bijective because each element of G1 is paired with exactly one element of G2 and each element of G2 is paired with exactly one element of G1. We also notice that the function f preserve the adjacency and if uv is an edge in the graph G1, then f of u, f of v is an edge in the graph G2. This means that G1 and G2 are isomorphic graphs. Now let's look at some properties of isomorphic graphs. Firstly, two graphs with different degree sequences can't be isomorphic. For instance, the two graphs shown here have different degree sequences. The first one has a degree sequence 3331 and the second one has a degree sequence 4431. Thus they can't be isomorphic. Secondly, two graph with the same degree sequence aren't necessarily isomorphic. For instance, even though the two graphs shown have the same degree sequence of 4221111 they are not isomorphic. We can prove this by showing the impossibility of constructing one-to-one correspondence between the vertex sets that preserves the adjacency. The following three graphs are 2-regular, simple and connected graphs with four vertices. It can be shown that there exists a bijection between any two of these graphs. Hence, all three graphs are isomorphic. Similarly, the following two graphs are 3-regular, simple, and connected graphs with six vertices. It can be shown that there exists a bijection between these two graphs. Hence, these graphs are isomorphic. Finally, the following two graphs are 2-regular, simple, connected with five vertices. It can be shown that there exist a bijection between these two graphs hence these two graphs are isomorphic. In this lecture we discussed the concept of isomorphism in terms of graphs. We also discussed some properties of isomorphic graphs including the relation of degree sequences of isomorphic graphs. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 7.2 Isomorphic graphs adjacency matrix Video: Video Isomorphic graphs .

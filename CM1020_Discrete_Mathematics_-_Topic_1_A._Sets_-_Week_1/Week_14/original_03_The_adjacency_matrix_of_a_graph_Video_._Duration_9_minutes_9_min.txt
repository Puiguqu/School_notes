Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key In this lesson, we will discuss two different ways of representing graphs. The first one is the use of the adjacency list to represent a graph. The second one is the use of the adjacency matrix. Finally, we will discuss some properties of the adjacency matrix. For example, the relation between the sum of the degree sequence of a graph and its corresponding adjacency matrix. So far we have seen that a graph can be represented by a set of vertices and a set of edges or connections. For example, the set V and E of the graph shown in the slide are as follows. The set of vertices is V which contains a, b, c, d, and e and the set of edges E which contain e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4, e_5, e_6, and e_7. The adjacency list of a graph G is a list of the vertices in G and their corresponding individual adjacent vertices. For example, the adjacency list of the graph shown below is as follow. The vertex A has B and C as its adjacent vertices. The vertex B has A, C, and D as its adjacent vertices. The vertex C has A, B, D, and E as its adjacent vertices. The vertex D has B, C, and E as its adjacent vertices. Finally, the vertex C and D are adjacent to E. Given the following adjacency list, we want to draw the graph it represents. Clearly, this graph consists of five vertices. We can use the adjacency list to draw this graph. v_1 is adjacent to v_1, v_2, and v_3. v_2 is adjacent to v_1, v_4, and v_5. v_3 is adjacent to v_1 and v_4. v_4 is adjacent to v_2, v_3, and v_5. Finally, v_5 is adjacent to v_2 and v_4. So far we have seen that a graph can be represented by a set of vertices and a set of edges, it's corresponding degree sequence, and it's adjacency list. A graph can also be represented by its corresponding adjacency matrix. For example, given the following graph, its corresponding adjacency list is as follow. The values highlighted in red correspond to an edge between v_1 and v_2. The values in the leading diagonal highlighted in orange correspond to the loops. As you can see, the one at v_1, v_1 means that there is a loop at v_1. Similarly, the one at v_2, v_2 means that there is a loop at v_2, and the zero at v_3, v_3 means that there is no loop at the vertex v_3. Let's look at the previous graph again. As you can see, the values in blue represent the edge between v_1 and v_2, the values in green represents the edge between v_1 and v_3, whereas the values in orange represent the parallel edges between v_2 and v_3. Hence, apart from the loops, every other edge is represented twice in the adjacency matrix. Hence for consistency, we can also represent the loops twice by multiplying the values in the leading diagonal by two. The adjacency matrix of the graph G becomes as follow. The adjacency matrix of an undirected graph is symmetric. This results from the fact that every edge is represented twice in the adjacency matrix. For example, the adjacency matrix of the graph shown on the slide is symmetric. The number of edges in an undirected graph is equal to half the sum of all the elements m_ij of its corresponding adjacency matrix. To put this in another way, the sum of all the elements of the adjacency matrix of an undirected graph is equal to the sum of its corresponding degree sequence. For example, let's consider the same graph as before. The degree of each vertex is added to the graph four for v_1, five for v_2, and three for v_3. The sum of the degree sequences of this graph is equal to 5 plus 4 plus 3 which is equal to 12. As you can see is equal to the sum of all the elements of its adjacency matrix which is one plus one plus one plus one plus two plus two plus two plus two. The sum of the degree sequence is equal to the sum of all the elements of this adjacency matrix M. Hence, the number of edges in this graph is equal to 12 over 2 which is equal to 6. In the following directed graph, you can see that each edge has a defined direction. So the adjacency matrix of G is as follow. As the direction of the edge is considered, each edge is counted only once in the adjacency matrix. Hence, the number of edges is equal to the sum of all the elements m_ij of the adjacency matrix. For example, the first row in M squared shows the number of paths of Length 2 from v_1. One path of Length 2 to v_1 and no paths of Length 2 from v_1 to v_2 or to v_3. The second row in the adjacency matrix squared shows the number of paths of Length 2 from v_2. There are four paths of Length 2 to v_1, there is one path of Length 2 to v_2, there are two paths of Length 2 to v_3. The third row of the adjacency matrix squared shows the number of paths of Length 2 from v_3. There is one path of Length 2 to v_1 and no paths of Length 2 from v_3 to v_2 or to v_3. In this lesson, we discussed two other ways of representing a graph. The first one is the use of the adjacency list, the second one is the use of the adjacency matrix to represent a graph. Finally, we looked at some properties. For example, the relation between the sum of the degree sequence of a graph and its corresponding adjacency matrix. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 7.2 Isomorphic graphs adjacency matrix Video: Video Isomorphic graphs .

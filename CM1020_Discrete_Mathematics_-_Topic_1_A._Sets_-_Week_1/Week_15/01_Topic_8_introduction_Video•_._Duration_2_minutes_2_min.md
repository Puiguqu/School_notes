Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

A mathematical concept known as "trees" is discussed, with an analogy to nature. In computer science, trees are represented upside down and have various applications. Trees can be used to represent organizational charts, file systems, and centralized version control systems. They are particularly useful in algorithms, such as finding the shortest path in a graph. Binary trees are a fundamental data structure in high-level programming. The lecture will examine the properties of trees and their application to real-world problems. Informal definitions of trees have been provided, with an upcoming lecture covering their properties. Trees can be used to model procedures carried out using a sequence of decisions. They have applications in games like checker and chess to determine winning strategies. A binary tree is defined as a fundamental data structure in high-level programming.

The concept of spanning trees and minimum spanning trees will also be covered. Spanning trees are used to represent a graph, while minimum spanning trees are used to find the shortest path between nodes. The goal of this lecture series is to discuss the properties of trees and their applications in real-world problems. The importance of trees in computer science cannot be overstated, as they have numerous practical uses.

The lecture series will include video lectures, practice assignments, and essential reading materials. This will provide students with a comprehensive understanding of trees and their significance in computer science.

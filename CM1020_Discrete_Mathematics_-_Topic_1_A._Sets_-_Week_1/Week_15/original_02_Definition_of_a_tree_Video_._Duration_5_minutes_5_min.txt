Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key In the first lesson of this topic, we will discuss the following; We will first define what we mean by an acyclic graph, we will then give a definition of a tree, we will then discuss two properties of trees, finally, we will define a particular type of trees called a rooted trees. A graph G is an acyclic graph if and only if G has no cycles. This includes no loops and no parallel edges. For instance, the directed graph G_1 contains at least one cycle B, C, D, E, B, thus, it is not an acyclic graph. However, the directed graph G_2 is a cycle-free, thus, it is an acyclic graph. In the introduction, the intuition behind trees was discussed. We now give a formal definition of a tree. An undirected graph G is a tree if and only if it is connected on acyclic. This means there exist a path between any two vertices of G, and G is cycle-free. For example, the following graph G_1 although which is connected, it is not a tree as it has at least one cycle. For example, the cycle A, B, D, A. However, the graph G_2 is a tree as it is connected and has no cycles. The Graph G_3 is also connected on cycle-free, hence it is also a tree. A forest in nature contains many trees. In graph theory, a cycle-free disconnected graph is called a forest. For instance, the graph F is a forest as it is disconnected and contains no cycles. Let's now examine some properties of trees. An undirected graph is a tree if and only if there is a unique simple path between any two of its vertices. We can prove this property by contradiction which is also known as absurdum. Given a graph G, let's assume that G is a tree, then G is connected and has no cycles. Let B and I be two vertices in G. We need to show that there is a unique path between B and I. Let P_1 be a path from B to I. Let's assume there exists another part P_2 between B and I. Hence, we can combine the first part from B to I with the part from I to B obtained by reversing the order of the second path. The result will form a cycle which is a contradiction of the hypothesis as the graph is a tree. Hence, there exists a unique simple path between any two vertices. This second tree among trees states that a tree with n vertices has exactly n minus one edges. For instance, the graph G_1 has three vertices and two edges, the graph G_2 has four vertices and three edges, and the graph G_3 has nine vertices and eight edges. We now introduce the concept of a rooted trees. A rooted tree is a tree in which one vertex has been designated as the root and every edge is directed away from the root. This lesson is an introduction to the concept of tracing graph theory. We first explain what it means to say that a graph is acyclic, we then gave a definition of of a tree using examples for clarification, we then introduced two properties of trees, finally, we gave the definition of a particular type of trees called rooted trees. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Video: Video Topic 8 introduction .

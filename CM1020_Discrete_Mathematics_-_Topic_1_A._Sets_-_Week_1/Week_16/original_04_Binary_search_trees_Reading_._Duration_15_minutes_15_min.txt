A binary search tree (BST) is a type of binary tree that maintains a sorted order of elements. Each node in a BST contains a: value (or key) pointer to the left child pointer to the right child. The BST property is defined as follows: The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with values less than the node's value. The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with values greater than the node's value. Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees. In this lesson you will learn: How to build a binary search tree containing a number of records. Find the height of binary search tree. How binary trees are used to search for values on a sorted list. Lesson 8.2 Rooted trees and binary search trees. Video: Video Rooted trees . Duration: 8 minutes 8 min Reading: Reading Rooted trees .

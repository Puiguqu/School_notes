Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

A relation between elements of two sets A and B can be defined as a link or connection between an element of set A to an element of set B. The relation R linking elements of set A to elements of set B is denoted by xRy, where x is related to y. The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, written as AxB, is a set of pairs (x,y) such that x is an element of set A and y is an element of set B. A binary relation from a set A to a set B is a subset of the Cartesian product AxB. The pair (x,y) is an element of R if and only if x is related to y. When the sets A and B are the same, we talk about a relation on the set A. In this case, a relation R and the set A is denoted by RxA. A relation can be defined between elements of the same set. For example, let R be a relation on the set A given x,y element of the set A, x is related to y if and only if x is strictly less than y. The relation R on the set A can be represented as a set of pairs (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), and (3, 4). A relation is reflexive if every element of the set is related to itself. A relation is symmetric if for every x in the set A, if x is related to y, then y is also related to x. A relation is anti-symmetric if for every x in the set A, if x is related to y and y is related to x, then x = y.

The Cartesian product of two sets A and B can be calculated using the formula: aAxB = {(a,b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ B}. The relation R on the set A can be represented in matrix form as:

```
| 1  2  3
|------------------
| 0  1  0
| 1  0  1
| 0  1  0
```

The relation R on the set A can also be represented graphically using a directed graph, where each element of the set is connected to every other element in the set.

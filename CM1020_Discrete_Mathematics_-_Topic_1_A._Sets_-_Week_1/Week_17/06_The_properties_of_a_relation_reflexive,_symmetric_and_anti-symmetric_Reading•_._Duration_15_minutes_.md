Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving all key information, formulae, and technical details:

1. In discrete mathematics, particularly in the study of relations, there are several key properties that a relation can possess.
2. Understanding these properties helps in analyzing the nature of relationships between elements in a set.
3. Three important properties of a relation are reflexivity, symmetry, and anti-symmetry.
4. A reflexive relation is one where every element in a set is related to itself.
5. The formal definition of a reflexive relation is: ∀a∈A, aRa
6. An example of a reflexive relation is R={(1,1),(2,2),(3,3)} on the set A={1,2,3}.
7. On the other hand, an example of a non-reflexive relation is R={(1,1),(2,2)} on the same set.
8. A symmetric relation is one where if an element is related to another, then the second element is also related to the first.
9. The formal definition of a symmetric relation is: ∀a,b∈A,(a,b)∈R⟹(b,a)∈R
10. An example of a symmetric relation is R={(1,2),(2,1)} on the set A={1,2}.
11. However, an example of a non-symmetric relation is R={(1,2)} on the same set.
12. An anti-symmetric relation is one where if an element is related to another and vice versa, then they must be the same element.
13. The formal definition of an anti-symmetric relation is: ∀a,b∈A,(a,b)∈R and (b,a)∈R⟹a=b
14. An example of an anti-symmetric relation is R={(1,1),(2,2),(3,3),(1,2)} on the set A={1,2,3}.
15. Understanding these properties is crucial for analyzing relations in sets, which is a foundational concept in discrete mathematics with applications in computer science, particularly in database theory and graph theory.

Note: The text also mentions that there will be another important property discussed in the next lesson, which is transitivity.

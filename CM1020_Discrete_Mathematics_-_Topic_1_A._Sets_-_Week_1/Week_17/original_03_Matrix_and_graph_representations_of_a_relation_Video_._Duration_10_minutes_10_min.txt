Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key In this lecture, we will discuss different ways of representing relations. First, we will show how relations can be represented via matrices, and give some examples. We will then discuss how to combine relations using matrices. We will then show how relations can be represented using directed graph or digraphs. Finally, we will give some example of digraph representation. Given a relation R from a set A to a set B, we first list the elements of a set A and B in a particular order. Actually, order doesn't matter. But, we will generally use ascending order. Let n_a be the cardinality of A, which stands for the number of elements in A, and n_b be the cardinality of the set B. The matrix M_r of the relation R is a n_a times n_b matrix, where the element M_ij is equal to one, if a_i is related to bj and zero otherwise, where a_i and bj are members of the set A and B respectively. Let A be the set of students comprising of Sofia, Samir, and Sarah, and B be the set of courses in a computer science degree containing CS100, CS101, CS102, and CS103. Let's consider the relation of who is enrolled in which class, defined in the following table. The relation R can be represented by the following matrix. Let A be the set which contains the elements 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Consider the relation strictly less than on a set A. This relation can be represented by the following matrix. First, let's note that every element in A is not related to itself. The elements in the leading diagonals are all zero. One is strictly less than the other elements of A, hence one is related to all the remaining elements. Two is related to 3, 4, and 5 only. Three is related to four and five only, whereas four is related to five only. Now, let's look at another example. In this example, we consider the same set A used in the previous example. The only difference is that, the relation on the set A is now less than or equal to instead of strictly less than, as in the previous example. This relation can be represented by the following matrix. As you can see, the values at the leading diagonal are all equal to one, as in each case, each element is related to itself. X is less than or equal to x for all x in the set A. Consider two relations, R and S. Let's now examine how combining relations work. Let's start by the union. The union of two relations is a new set that contains all the pair of elements that are in at least one of the two relations. The union is written as R union S. R union S is a set of pairs a, b such that a, b is an element of R, or a, b is an element of S. What about the intersection? The intersection of two relations is a new set that contains all of the pairs that are in both sets. The intersection is written as, R intersection S, or R and S. R intersection S is equal to the set of pairs a, b such that a, b is an element of R and a, b is an element of S. Let's consider two relations, R and S represented by the matrices M_R and M_S respectively. We can use the Boolean matrices, where entrees are either zero or one to combine two relations R and S. For instance, the union of two relations can be calculated using the joint of the two matrices as shown on the screen. The intersection of the two relations can be calculated using the meet of the two matrices as shown on the screen. A relation on a set A can be represented by a digraph whose vertices are all the elements of A. For any two elements x, y of the set A, x is related to y if and only if there is an arrow from x to y. Consider the following set A, containing the elements 1, 2, 3, and 4. Consider the following relation on A defined as follows. Given two elements x and y of a, x is related to y if and only if x divides y. This relation can be represented by the following digraph. Each element of the set A divides itself, hence there is a loop at each vertex. One divides all other elements whereas two divides the element four only. Similarly, consider the relation less than or equal to. On a set A containing the elements 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. This relation can be represented by the following digraph. The loops at each vertex show that every element in a set A is related to itself. The digraph shows that, every element is related to itself and to every element greater than itself. Similarly, consider the relation strictly less than, on the same set A as in the previous example. This relation can be represented by the following digraph. The only difference from the previous graph or digraph is that, this graph contains no loop at each vertex. The reason for this is that every element of the set A is not related to itself. In this lecture, we discussed different ways of representing relations. First, we showed how relations can be represented via matrices. We then presented how to combine relations using matrices. Finally, we showed how relations can be represented via digraphs. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Video: Video Topic 9 introduction .

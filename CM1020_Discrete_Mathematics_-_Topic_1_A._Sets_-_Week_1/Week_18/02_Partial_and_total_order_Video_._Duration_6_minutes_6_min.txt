Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

A relation R on elements in a set S is said to be a partial order if it satisfies three properties: reflexivity, anti-symmetry, and transitivity. A relation R is reflexive if for all a in S, the pair (a, a) is an element of R. A relation R is anti-symmetric if whenever a is related to b and b is related to a, then a is equal to b for all a and b in S. A relation R is transitive if whenever a is related to b and b is related to c, then a is related to c for all a, b, and c in S.

The relation "less than or equal to" on the set of integers Z is an example of a partial order because it satisfies these three properties. Another example is the relation "divides" on the set of positive integers Z+, which also satisfies these properties.

A total order is defined as a partial order where for all pairs (a, b) in S, either a is related to b or b is related to a. This means that every two elements in the set can be compared with respect to the relation. The relation "less than or equal to" on Z is an example of a total order.

However, not every partial order is a total order. For example, the relation "divides" on Z+ is a partial order but not a total order because there are elements that are incomparable with respect to this relation.

In summary, a partial order and a total order are two different types of relations on a set, where a partial order satisfies reflexivity, anti-symmetry, and transitivity, while a total order adds the condition that every two elements can be compared.

In discrete mathematics, equivalence relations are a special type of relation that partition a set into distinct subsets called equivalence classes. Understanding these concepts is fundamental in various areas of mathematics and computer science. Equivalence relations: A relation R on a set A is an equivalence relation if it is reflexive, symmetric and transitive. Reflexive: ∀a∈A,(a,a)∈R Symmetric: ∀a,b∈A,(a,b)∈R⟹(b,a)∈R Transitive: ∀a,b,c∈A,(a,b)∈R and (b,c)∈R⟹(a,c)∈R Example of an equivalence relation: Consider the set A={1,2,3,4} and the relation R defined as follows: R={(1,1),(2,2),(3,3),(4,4),(1,3),(3,1)} Let's verify the properties: Reflexive: Every element is related to itself: (1,1),(2,2),(3,3),(4,4)∈R. Symmetric: If (1,3)∈R, then (3,1)∈R and vice versa. Transitive: If (1,3)∈R and (3,1)∈R, then (1,1)∈R. Thus, R is an equivalence relation. Equivalence classes Given an equivalence relation R on a set A, the equivalence class of an element a∈A, denoted by [a], is defined as: [a]={x∈A∣(a,x)∈R} Equivalence classes partition the set A into disjoint subsets where every element in A belongs to exactly one equivalence class. Example: Consider the previous set A={1,2,3,4} and the equivalence relation R. The equivalence classes are: [1]={1,3} [2]={2} [3]={1,3} [4]={4} Notice that elements 1 and 3 are in the same equivalence class because they are related by R. Properties of equivalence classes Each element of A belongs to exactly one equivalence class. If two equivalence classes intersect, they are identical. The union of all equivalence classes covers the entire set A. Understanding equivalence relations and equivalence classes allows us to classify elements into distinct categories based on the defined relation, which is useful many areas of algebra and computer science.

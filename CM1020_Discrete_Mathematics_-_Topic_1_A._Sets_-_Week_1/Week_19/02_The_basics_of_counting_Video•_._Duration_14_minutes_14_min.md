# The basics of counting Videoâ€¢ . Duration: 14 minutes 14 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/sB5C2/the-basics-of-counting)

This is a text-based representation of an educational video lecture on combinatorics, which is a branch of mathematics dealing with the counting of objects in different ways. The lecture covers several basic counting rules and techniques, including:

1. Product rule
2. Addition rule
3. Subtraction rule (also known as principle of inclusion-exclusion)
4. Division rule
5. Combining sum and product rules

The lecture also introduces the concept of permutations and combinations, which are used to count the number of ways objects can be arranged or selected.

The video lecture includes several examples and practice assignments to help students understand and apply these concepts. The reading assignment at the end provides additional resources for further study.

There is no specific problem or question posed in this text, but rather a general introduction to combinatorics and its various counting rules and techniques. If you'd like, I can try to create a practice problem or question based on this material!

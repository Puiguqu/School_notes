Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

A counting problem can be solved by finding the number of ways to arrange distinct elements in a set of a particular size. Permutations involve arranging objects in order, while combinations involve unordered selections. The number of r-permutations of a set with n elements is denoted by P(n,r), which equals n factorial divided by (n-r) factorial.

The formula for permutations can be proven using the product rule, where there are n choices for the first element, n-1 choices for the second element, and so on. This results in n! / (n-r)! possible permutations.

Combinations, on the other hand, involve unordered selections of r elements from a set of n distinct elements. The number of r-combinations is denoted by C(n,r), which equals n factorial divided by r factorial times (n-r) factorial.

The notation "n choose r" refers to the binomial coefficient and represents the number of r-combinations from a set of n elements. This can also be calculated as n! / ((n-r)!r!).

To find the number of all permutations of a set with n elements, we use the formula P(n,r) = n! / (n-r)!. For example, to find the number of three permutations of a set with 50 elements, we calculate 50! / (50-3)!.

In the problem of selecting a first prize winner, second prize winner, and third prize winner from 50 different people, we need to find the number of three permutations. This equals 50! / (50-3)! = 117,600 possible ways.

The order of objects in selections is important in permutations but not in combinations. In the scenario of choosing six players from a tennis team with 20 members, we want to find the number of six combinations. Using the formula C(n,r), this equals 20! / (6!(20-6)!) = 38,760.

In summary, permutations involve ordered arrangements while combinations involve unordered selections. The formulas for permutations and combinations are n! / (n-r)! for r-permutations and n! / ((n-r)!r!) for r-combinations.

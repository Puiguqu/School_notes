Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key In this video, we will introduce a new topic called Combinatorics. Combinatorics is a branch of mathematics concerned in the study of finite or countable discrete structures. It is the study of collections or arrangements of objects. Specifically, it involves counting objects and studying the mathematical properties of different arrangements of objects. Combinatorics is an important part of discrete mathematics. It has many applications in computer programming, physics, economics, and many other fields particularly in probability theory. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Video: Video Topic 10 introduction .

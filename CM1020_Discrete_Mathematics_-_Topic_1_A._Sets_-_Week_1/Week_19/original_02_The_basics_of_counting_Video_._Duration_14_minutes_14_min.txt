Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key In this lecture, we will introduce the topic of combinatorics. We will look at the following basic counting rules. The product rule, the addition or some rule, then combining the sum and product rules, the subtraction rules, and the division rule. Let's begin by looking at the product rule. Suppose we have a process consisting of two tasks, and there are a number of ways of executing each of these tasks. We want to work out the number of ways of executing the whole process. Let's say, there are n different ways of executing the first task, and for each of these n ways of doing the first task, there are m ways of doing the second task. Hence there are n times m different ways of executing the whole process. Let's consider the following example, where a restaurant is offering a combination meal. Suppose a customer can order one dish from each of the following categories: two salads, three main dishes, four side dishes, and three desserts. Let's ask ourselves the following question. How many different combination meals are possible for a customer to choose from? To find the answer to this question we began by breaking down the problem into four independent events. Selecting a salad, selecting a main dish, selecting of side dish, and selecting a dessert. For each of these four events the number of available option is two for the first events, three for the second event, four for the third event, and three for the fourth event. Thus by multiplying 2 by 3 by 4 then multiplying by 3 together, we can calculate that there are 72 combination meals available for customers to choose from. Let's now look at the product rule in terms of sets. Let A be a set of ways to do the first task, and let B the set of ways to do the second task. If A and B are disjoint, then the number of ways to do both tasks task 1 and task 2 can be represented as the cardinality of the gross product of A and B, which is equal to the cardinality of A times the cardinality of B as both sets are disjoint. In other words, the number of elements in the Cartesian product of these sets is just the product of the number of elements in each set. Now let's move on to look at the addition rule or the sum rule. Let's suppose that a task 1 can be done in n ways, and a task 2 can be done in m different ways. Let's also assume that both tasks are independent of each other. In other words, executing task 1 doesn't accomplish tasks 2 and vice versa. In this case, the number of ways of executing task 1 or task 2 is equal to just n plus m. This is called the addition or the sum rule. Let's look at the following example. Imagine that the computing department must choose either a student or a member of academic staff to be a representative at a particular university committee. Suppose that there are 10 members academic staff and 77 students, and no person is both a member of academic staff and a student at the same time. Let's say that we want to find the number of possible choices for the selection of this representative. This problem can be solved using the addition rule by adding 10 and 77 together. So we know there are 87 ways of selecting a representative for this committee. Let's now look at the sum rule or the addition rule in terms of sets. If A is a set of ways to do task 1, and B is the set of ways to do task 2, and if A and B are disjoint, then the number of ways to do either task 1 or task 2 is just the cardinality of the union of A and B which is equal to the cardinality of A plus the cardinality of B as A and B are disjoint. Now let's look at an example where the product under some rule can be combined to solve a more complex problem. Let's assume that a label in a programming language can be either a letter from the English alphabet or a letter followed by two digits. The question is, what is the number of possible labels? To solve this problem, we can divide it into two tasks. In the first task, the label can be a letter, whereas in the second task the label is a letter followed by two digits. Both these tasks are independent. The number of labels in task 1 is 26 because there are 26 letters in the English alphabet. By using the product rule, we can work out the number of labels in task two, by multiplying 26 by 10 and multiply it by 10 second time. Finally by using the sum rule, we can work out the total number of labels. This is just the number of labels with one letter plus the number of labels with one letter followed by two digits which is equal to 2626. Let's now look at another rule called the subtraction rule. Suppose that a task can be done either in one of n_1 ways or in one n_2 different ways, then the total number of ways to do the task is n_1 plus n_2 minus the number of ways common to the two different ways. This is also known as the principle of inclusion exclusion. As we saw in the earlier topic on set theory. Let's demonstrate or show the subtraction rule with an example. Consider the following question. How many binary bit strings of length eight either start with one bit or end with two bits which is zero zero? To solve this problem, we began by working out the number of binary bit strings of length eight starting with one, as the first binary bit is fixed, we only have the remaining seven bits which can be either zero or one. Then the total number of binary string starting with one is equal to two to the power of seven which is equal to 128. Similarly, the number of binary bit strings of length eight ending with the two bits zero zero is two to the power of six which is equal to 64. This is because the last two bits are fixed, so we only have to consider the remaining six bits. Similarly, the number of binary bit strings of length eight that starts with one, and end with the binary bit zero zero is equal to two to the power of five which is 32 as the first bit and the last two bits are fixed. Hence, using the subtraction rule, we can work out the number of binary bit strings of length eight, that either starts with a one or end with zero zero using the following calculation, 128 plus 64 minus 32 which is equal to a 160. Now, let's look at another rule called the division rule. Suppose that a task can be done using a procedure that can be carried out in n ways, and for every way w exactly d of the n ways corresponds to w, then this task can be done in n over d ways. In terms of sets, If the finite set A is the union of n pair-wise disjoint subsets each with d element then n is equal to the cardinality of A over d. In terms of functions, If f is a function from A to B, where both A and B are finite sets, and for every value y of b there are exactly d values x in A such that x is the pre image of y. Then the cardinality of B in this case is just the cardinality of A over d. Let's look at the following example. How many ways can we sit four people around the table, where two seating arrangements are considered to be the same, when each person has the same left and the right neighbor. We can use the division rule to solve this problem. First, let's work out the number of different seating arrangement without considering the same seat, where both left and right neighbors are the same. There are four ways to select the person for seat one, three ways to select the person for seat two, two ways to select the person for seat three, and one way to select the person for seat four. Therefore, there are four times three times two times one which is equal to 24 ways to sit all four people. Since two sitting arrangements are considered to be the same when each person has the same left and right neighbor, this means for every choice for seat one we get the same sitting. Therefore, by using the division rule, we can calculate that there are 24 over 4 different seating arrangements which is equal to six. In this lecture, we introduce some basic counting rules, we discussed the product addition, subtraction, and division rules, as well as combining the sum and product rules, we also work through example for each of these basic counting rules. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Video: Video Topic 10 introduction .

In this lecture, we will discuss two concepts, permutations and combinations, which are used to solve this type of counting problems. Let's begin by defining a permutation. A permutation of a set of distinct objects is another arrangement of these objects. All other are arrangements of all elements of a set is called an r-permutation. The number of r-permutations of a set with n element is denoted by P(n,r), which means r-permutations of a set with n elements. Now, let's demonstrate this with an example. Let S be a set containing three elements 1, 2, and 3. The order arrangements 3, 1, 2, is three permutation of S. The order arrangement 3, 2 is a two permutations of S. The two permutations of S are 1, 2; 1, 3; 2, 1; 2, 3; 3, 1; and 3, 2. Therefore, the number of two permutations of S is equal to six. Let n be a positive integer and r be an integer less than or equal to n. The number of all permutations of a set with n elements, p of n, r, which is equal to n times n minus 1, times n minus 2, and so on, till we get to n minus r minus 1. This can be formulated as n factorial over n minus r factorial. We can prove this formula using the product rule, which we looked at in the previous lecture. Using the product rule, there are n different ways for choosing the first element, there are n minus 1 ways for choosing the second element, there are n minus 2 ways for choosing the third element, and so on. Finally, there are n minus (r-1) ways to choose the last element. Therefore, the number of all permutation of n element is equal to n times n minus 1, times n minus 2, and so on, times n minus bracket r minus 1. Now, let's try to solve the following problem. How many possible ways are there of selecting a first prize winner, a second prize winner, and the third prize winner from 50 different people? What we are trying to find is the number of three permutations of a set containing 50 elements. The number of possible ways of selecting the three prize winners is just the number of three permutations from a set containing 50 element, which is equal to 50 times 49 times 48, which gives us a total of 117,600. We have seen how the order of objects selection is important in permutations. Now, we will look at another type of object selection where the order is not important, this is called combinations. An r-combination of element of a set is an unordered selection of r element from the set. An r-combination is a subset of the set with r elements. The number of r-combinations of a set with n distinct elements is denoted by C(n,r), which stands for n choose r. The notation that we use is called a binomial coefficient. The number of r-combinations of a set with n distinct elements can be formulated as, n factorial over n minus r factorial, times r factorial. This is equal to the number of r-permutations of n different objects over r factorial, and it can be referred to as n choose r. From this definition, it follows the n choose r is equal to n choose n minus r. Now, let's look at the following scenario. We have a tennis team with 20 members, and we want to find the number of ways of choosing six players to take part in an international competition. Clearly, the order in which we choose the player is not important in this case. In other word, we want to find the number of six combinations from 20 element. The answer is just 20 choose six, which is equal to 20 factorial over six factorial, times 14 factorial. Which is equal to 20 times 19, times 18, times 17, times 16, times 15, over 6 times 5, times 4, times 2, times 2, which gives us the value of 38,760. In this lecture, we looked at two counting concepts. The first was permutations, where the order of elements selection is important. The second was combinations, where the order of selections doesn't matter. Finally, we encountered some counting problems and showed how permutations or combinations can be used to solve these types of problems. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Video: Video Topic 10 introduction .

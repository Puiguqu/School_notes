Read the following extracts from the Koshy textbook. These pages will cover the following topics: the basic counting principles; complex counting problems; the pigeonhole principle; the generalised pigeonhole principle; permutations and combinations; examples of strong induction; and the definition and examples of the well-ordering property. Koshy, pp.343–48, pp.351–54 . Once you’ve finished the reading, attempt the following exercises: pp.349–50, exercises 1–5, 10, 34, 36 pp.358–59, exercises 1–4, 14 and 17–21 Several exercises have solutions at the back of the book under the section ‘Solutions to odd-numbered exercises’. Please consult this section to check the answer to your exercises. If you got the answer wrong, take a look back at the question and see how you can arrive at the right answer.

## The basics of counting Video• . Duration: 14 minutes 14 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/sB5C2/the-basics-of-counting)

This is a text-based representation of an educational video lecture on combinatorics, which is a branch of mathematics dealing with the counting of objects in different ways. The lecture covers several basic counting rules and techniques, including:

1. Product rule
2. Addition rule
3. Subtraction rule (also known as principle of inclusion-exclusion)
4. Division rule
5. Combining sum and product rules

The lecture also introduces the concept of permutations and combinations, which are used to count the number of ways objects can be arranged or selected.

The video lecture includes several examples and practice assignments to help students understand and apply these concepts. The reading assignment at the end provides additional resources for further study.

There is no specific problem or question posed in this text, but rather a general introduction to combinatorics and its various counting rules and techniques. If you'd like, I can try to create a practice problem or question based on this material!

## The pigeonhole principle Video• . Duration: 7 minutes 7 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/yOACm/the-pigeonhole-principle)

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

The Pigeonhole Principle is a fundamental concept in mathematics that states if K+1 objects are placed into K boxes, then at least one box contains two or more objects. This can be proved by contra-positive, where assuming none of the boxes has more than one object leads to a contradiction with the initial statement. The basic version of the principle can be stated as: "If K+1 objects are placed into K boxes, then at least one box contains two or more objects."

To demonstrate this principle, consider a flock of 10 pigeons and 9 pigeonholes. One pigeonhole contains two pigeons, while the other eight contain one each. This illustrates how the principle can be applied to real-life scenarios.

The Pigeonhole Principle can also be used to prove that if a function F has K+1 elements in its domain and K elements in its co-domain, then it is not a one-to-one function. By creating boxes for each element of the co-domain and placing all elements from the domain into these boxes, we can show that at least one box contains two or more elements.

A generalized version of the Pigeonhole Principle states that if N objects are placed into K boxes, then there is at least one box containing at least the ceiling of N over K objects. This can be proved by contra-positive as well.

To apply this principle to a real-world problem, consider selecting cards from a standard deck of 52 cards to guarantee that at least four cards of the same suit are chosen. Using the generalized version of the Pigeonhole Principle, we can show that if N is the number of cards selected, then at least one box (suit) contains at least four cards.

The smallest value of N that satisfies this condition is 13, meaning we need to select a minimum of 13 cards to ensure that at least four cards of the same suit are chosen.

## Permutations and combinations Video• . Duration: 9 minutes 9 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/5sI2V/permutations-and-combinations)

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

A counting problem can be solved by finding the number of ways to arrange distinct elements in a set of a particular size. Permutations involve arranging objects in order, while combinations involve unordered selections. The number of r-permutations of a set with n elements is denoted by P(n,r), which equals n factorial divided by (n-r) factorial.

The formula for permutations can be proven using the product rule, where there are n choices for the first element, n-1 choices for the second element, and so on. This results in n! / (n-r)! possible permutations.

Combinations, on the other hand, involve unordered selections of r elements from a set of n distinct elements. The number of r-combinations is denoted by C(n,r), which equals n factorial divided by r factorial times (n-r) factorial.

The notation "n choose r" refers to the binomial coefficient and represents the number of r-combinations from a set of n elements. This can also be calculated as n! / ((n-r)!r!).

To find the number of all permutations of a set with n elements, we use the formula P(n,r) = n! / (n-r)!. For example, to find the number of three permutations of a set with 50 elements, we calculate 50! / (50-3)!.

In the problem of selecting a first prize winner, second prize winner, and third prize winner from 50 different people, we need to find the number of three permutations. This equals 50! / (50-3)! = 117,600 possible ways.

The order of objects in selections is important in permutations but not in combinations. In the scenario of choosing six players from a tennis team with 20 members, we want to find the number of six combinations. Using the formula C(n,r), this equals 20! / (6!(20-6)!) = 38,760.

In summary, permutations involve ordered arrangements while combinations involve unordered selections. The formulas for permutations and combinations are n! / (n-r)! for r-permutations and n! / ((n-r)!r!) for r-combinations.

## Combinatorics Reading• . Duration: 2 hours 2h

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/supplement/4Hqn9/combinatorics)

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences:

The provided text refers to extracts from Koshy's textbook on combinatorics. The textbook covers various topics, including basic counting principles, complex counting problems, and permutations and combinations. The reading will focus on six specific topics: counting principles, complex counting problems, the pigeonhole principle, generalized pigeonhole principle, permutations and combinations, strong induction, and well-ordering property. After completing the reading, students are encouraged to attempt exercises 1-5, 10, 34, 36 (pp.349-350), and 17-21 (pp.358-59). The textbook also provides solutions to odd-numbered exercises in a separate section. Students can check their answers by consulting this section. If they get an answer wrong, they are advised to review the question and try again. The video topics listed include "Combinatorics" (Duration: 10 minutes), "The basics of counting" (Duration: 14 minutes), "The pigeonhole principle" (Duration: 7 minutes), and "Permutations and combinations" (Duration: 9 minutes). Each topic has a practice assignment associated with it, which students can complete to reinforce their understanding. The total duration for the reading is 2 hours. Additionally, there are videos available on various combinatorics topics, including an introduction to the subject. Students can mark the assigned pages as completed and report any issues they encounter while working through the exercises or video materials. Overall, the text aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to combinatorics concepts using Koshy's textbook as the primary resource.

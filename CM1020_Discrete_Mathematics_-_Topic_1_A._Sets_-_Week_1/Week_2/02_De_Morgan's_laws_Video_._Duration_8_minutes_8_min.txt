Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Augustus De Morgan was a British mathematician who formulated De Morgan's laws, which describe the relationship between mathematical statements and their opposites.

De Morgan's laws are applicable to sets, propositions, and logic gates, and their structure is always the same.

The first law states that the complement of the union of two sets is equal to the intersection of their complements: A ∩ B' = (A' ∪ B')'.

The second law states that the complement of the intersection of two sets is equal to the union of their complements: A ∪ B' = (A' ∩ B').

De Morgan's laws can be proven using membership tables and Venn diagrams. The first law can be demonstrated by building a membership table showing that the columns corresponding to the complement of the union and the intersection of the complements are identical.

The second law can also be proven using a membership table, as the column corresponding to the complement of the intersection is equal to the column corresponding to the union of the complements.

Venn diagrams can be used to visualize De Morgan's laws. The diagram for A ∪ B shows all elements in A or B, while the diagram for A ∩ B' shows all elements not in both A and B.

By examining these Venn diagrams, it is clear that (A' ∪ B') = A ∩ B', demonstrating the first law.

Similarly, the diagram for A ∩ B shows all common elements between A and B, while the diagram for A' ∪ B' shows all elements not in both A and B.

This demonstrates that A ∪ B' = (A' ∩ B'), showing the second law.

De Morgan's laws have practical applications, as illustrated by an example involving subsets of a universal set.

In this example, the complement of A ∪ B is equal to the complement of A intersection the complement of B.

This demonstrates that De Morgan's laws are valid and applicable in real-world scenarios.

Overall, De Morgan's laws provide a fundamental understanding of set relationships and have numerous applications in mathematics and other fields.

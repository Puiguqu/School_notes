Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

The video transcript provides a set theory problem where A = [1, 2] and B = [2, 3]. To solve this, we need to find the powerset of A ∩ B, A ∪ B, and A × B. The intersection of two sets is given by elements that are in both sets, resulting in A ∩ B = [2]. The powerset of A ∩ B includes the empty set and {2}. The union of two sets is given by elements that are in either set, resulting in A ∪ B = [1, 2, 3]. The powerset of A ∪ B includes the empty set and all possible subsets of [1, 2, 3], totaling 7 subsets. The Cartesian product of two sets, A × B, is given by (x, y), where x is from A and y is from B, resulting in A × B = [(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)]. The powerset of A × B includes all possible subsets of the Cartesian product.

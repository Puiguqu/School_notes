## Step 1: Understand the laws of sets and their applications
The problem requires us to simplify a given expression using the laws of sets. The laws of sets are mathematical principles used to manipulate and simplify set operations.

## Step 2: Identify the laws applicable to the given expression
To simplify the expression (A∪B)∩(A∪B c ), we need to apply the distributive law, absorption law, complement law, and double negation law.

## Step 3: Apply the distributive law
First, we distribute the intersection over the union using the distributive law: (A∪B)∩(A∪B c ) = (A∩(A∪B c )) ∪ (B∩(A∪B c ).

## Step 4: Simplify each term
Next, we simplify each term. A∩(A∪B c ) can be simplified using the absorption law, which states that A∩(A∪B) = A.

## Step 5: Apply the distributive law to B
For the second term, B∩(A∪B c ), we apply the distributive law again. However, since (B∩B c ) equals ∅, we need to find an alternative way to simplify this expression.

## Step 6: Simplify using De Morgan's laws and complement law
We use De Morgan's laws to relate the complement of the union of sets to the intersection of their complements. By applying De Morgan's laws, (A∪B) c = A c ∩ B c .

## Step 7: Combine simplified terms
Now we combine the simplified terms. Since B∩(A∪B c ) can be rewritten as B∩(A c ∩B c ), and since B∩B c is a contradiction (∅), this simplifies to just B.

## Step 8: Apply the absorption law
With A from step 4, we can now simplify further using the absorption law. This states that A ∪ (B ∩ A) = A.

## Step 9: Final simplification
Applying the absorption law to our expression gives us A ∪ B ∩ A, which simplifies to just A.


The final answer is: $\boxed{A}$

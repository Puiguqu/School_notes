# Sets problem sheet Readingâ€¢ . Duration: 30 minutes 30 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/supplement/YyoV3/sets-problem-sheet)

Unfortunately, there is no text to summarize in this case. The provided text appears to be a notice or announcement related to a lesson on sets and does not contain any substantive content.

However, I can provide a summary of the overall structure and topics covered in the announcement:

The announcement recommends that students attempt to complete a worksheet containing problems relating to the topic of sets as a way to prepare for an upcoming exam. The worksheet will be made available with solutions in the next reading session. Additionally, videos and slides related to the topic are available for viewing during the lesson.

If you could provide the actual text from the "Reading Sets problem sheet" or other relevant materials, I would be happy to help summarize it for you.

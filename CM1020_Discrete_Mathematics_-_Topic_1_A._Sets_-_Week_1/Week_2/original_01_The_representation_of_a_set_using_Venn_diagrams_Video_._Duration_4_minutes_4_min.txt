Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key In this lesson, we will introduce the concept of Venn diagram and how Venn diagrams are used to represent sets. In this lesson, we'll cover the following, the universal set, the complement of a set, and how Venn diagram is used to represent a set. The universal set is a set containing everything. We refer to the universal set by the letter U. Venn diagrams are used to visualize the possible relation among a collection of sets. The area in red represents the universal set U. Now given a set A, which is a subset of the universal set U, the Venn diagram of A is represented here. The area in red represents the set A. Given a set A, the complement of A is a set containing all the elements in the universal set that are not in A. We refer to the compliment of A by A bar. So the complement of A is equal to the universal set minus A, which means all the elements of universal set takeaway from it all the elements of A. Here is an example. The universal set in this case contain the elements from one till 10 and a set A containing only the even number two to 10. The complement of A, in this case, will contain only 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9, which are the elements of the universal set U, which are not in A. The union of a set A and its corresponding complement is always equal to the universal set. In this Venn diagram, the area colored in red represents the compliment of A. We now present Venn diagram for the union of two sets. Given the following Venn diagram representing the sets A and B, joined in the most general way, the red area represents the union of A and B. Similarly, for the intersection of A and B, the red area represents the intersection of A and B. The red area in this diagram represent the set difference of A and B. Here, the area in red represents the symmetric difference of A and B. One way of showing that two sets are the same is to draw a Venn diagram for each of them and then simply compare the diagrams. For example, we can show that the symmetric difference of A and B is equal to the union of A and B minus the intersection of A and B. We can show this by comparing the area representing each set in Venn diagram. The top diagram here represents the symmetric difference of A and B, and the bottom diagram represents the union of A and B minus the intersection of a set A and B. The red area in both diagrams is the same. Therefore, the symmetric difference of the set A and the set B is just the union of A and B minus the intersection of A and B. In this lesson, we introduced the concept of using a Venn diagram to represent a set as well as the complement of a set. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 1.2 Set representation and manipulation Video: Video The representation of a set using Venn diagrams .

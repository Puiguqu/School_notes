Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key In this lecture, we will cover the following set identities. First one is commutativity, the second one is associativity, and the third one is distributivity. First, let's define commutativity. An operation in which the order of element does not affect the result is called commutative. For example, the addition of numbers is commutative, as 2+3 is the same as 3+2. Similarly, the multiplication of numbers is commutative. 2*3 is the same as 3*2. However, the subtraction of numbers is not commutative. 2-3 = -1, which is different to 3-2 = 1. The set union is a commutative operation, as A union B is the same as B union A. The set intersection is a commutative operation as A intersection B is equal to B intersection A. The symmetric difference is also a commutative operation, as, asymmetric difference B is equal to B symmetric difference of A. However, the set difference is not a commutative operation, as shown in the following example. Here we have two sets A and B. A contains the element 1 and 2, whereas B contains the elements 1 and 3. For A-B, we just remove the elements of B from A. In this case, we only need to remove one from the set A, this implies that A-B has only one element, which is two. Similarly, for B-A, we just remove all the elements in A from the set B. Then we get B-A containing only one element, which is three, which is different from the set A-B. Therefore, the set difference is not competitive as A-B is different from B-A. We have seen that commutativity concerns the order of certain mathematical operations. Associativity, on the other hand, concern grouping of elements in an operation. For example, the addition of numbers is associative. Let's take three numbers, A, B, and C. The result of the following addition, the sum of A and B+C is equal to A plus the sum of B and C. The grouping of element does not affect the result of the addition. Therefore, we say that the addition of numbers is associative. The grouping of element does not affect the result in the case of the union, the intersection or the symmetric difference of sets. Therefore, the set union is associative, the set intersection is associative, and finally, the symmetric difference of sets is also associative. However, the set difference is not an associative operation as shown in this example. Here we have three sets A, B and C. If we subtract B from A first, then subtract C, we get the empty set. However, if we subtract C from B first, then subtract the result from A, we get a set containing the element 2, which is different from the empty set. Hence, the set difference is not associative. Distributivity states that multiplying of sum by a number gives the same result as multiplying each number and then adding the products together. The distributive property is sometimes called the distributive law of multiplication and division. For example, three times the sum of two and five is the same as 3*2+3*5, therefore, we say that the multiplication is distributive over the addition. Given three sets A, B, and C, the union is distributive over the intersection. Similarly, the intersection is distributive over the union. This can be shown using membership tables as we will see in the next two slides. The membership table given here shows that the union of sets is distributive over the intersection of sets, as both columns highlighted in orange are the same. The first columns correspond to A union B intersection C, whereas the second column correspond to A union B intersection A union C. As you can see, both columns are the same, therefore, A union B intersection C is the same as A union B intersection A union C, and we say that the union is distributed over the intersection. Similarly, the membership table given here shows that the intersection of sets is distributed over the union of sets. As both columns highlighted in orange are the same. The first column is A intersection B union C, whereas the second column is A intersection B union A intersection C. As you can see, the value of both columns are the same, therefore, the union of B and C is the same as A intersection B union, A intersection C, and we say that the intersection is distributed over the union. In this table, you can see a number of useful set identities. The first one is related to commutativity. The union and the intersection are both commutative, the second one relates to associativity, both the union and the intersection are associative. The third one relates to distributivity. The union is distributive over the intersection. The intersection is distributive over the union. Fourth one is De Morgan's law. The complement of A union B is just the complement of A intersection the complement of B, whereas the complement of A intersection B, is just the complement of A union the complement of B. This is as just identity A union, the empty set is always A. A union, the universal set is always universal set because A is contained in the universal set. A intersection the empty set is equal to the empty set. A intersection, the universal set is equal to A. Here is related to the complement of a set. A set A union, its complement is always equal to the universal set. The complement of the universal set is empty set. Here, a set A intersection complement is always equal to the empty set. The complement of the empty set A is equal to the universal set. The complement of the complement of A is equal to A, so it doesn't change. If you apply the complement twice, you don't change anything. Here is called an absorption law. A union A intersection B is equal to A, A intersection A union B is equal to A. The last one relate to set difference, A-B is equal to A intersection, the complement of B. This set identities can be used to simplify set expressions, as we will see in the following example. This example will show you how set identities can be used to simplify set expressions. Suppose we want to show that the complement of A intersection B union complement of A is equal to just B intersection, the complement of A. First, we use De Morgan's law, then therefore, this is equal just to the complement of A intersection B, intersection the complement of the complement of B. The complement of the complement of B is just B. Here again, we use De Morgan's law. The complement of A intersection B is just the complement of A union the complement of B. Again, De Morgan's law allow us to do that. Here it just commutativity, I just move B back here, intersection, the complement of A union the complement of B. Here, distributive law will allow me to say that this is the same as B intersection the complement of A, union B intersection the complement of B. We've already know that B intersection the complement of B is an empty set. Therefore, this is equal just to B intersection the complement of a union, the empty set, which is just B intersection the complement of A. In this lecture, we looked at the following set identities: Commutativity, associativity, and distributivity. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 1.2 Set representation and manipulation Video: Video The representation of a set using Venn diagrams .

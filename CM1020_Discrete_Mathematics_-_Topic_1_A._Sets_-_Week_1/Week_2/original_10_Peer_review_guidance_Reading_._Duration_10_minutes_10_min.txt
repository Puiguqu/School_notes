In the following task, you will be asked to undertake a peer review. Peer review is a collaborative process where students, scholars or researchers evaluate each other's work to provide feedback and to learn from one another. In an academic setting, this involves carefully reading a peer's assignment to critique its content and arguments. What are peer review assignments? As you work through the Computer Science programme, peer reviews may be part of your required assignments. There are two parts to peer-graded assignments: You must submit your own assignment, which will be graded by your peers. In turn, you are required to grade a minimum number of your peers' submitted assignments. This must be completed in order to receive a grade for your own assignment. When grading your peer’s work, you will be provided a rubric which clearly describes the assignment components and the type of responses that correspond to each possible grade. Rubrics are used to ensure grading consistency; they also help learners understand the expectations of each assignment. Purpose: Why complete a peer review? The purpose of peer review is not just to critique but to offer constructive feedback that can help the author improve their work. The process of peer review is also extremely valuable as you engage with how someone else understands the same question that you addressed. This process is fundamental in developing critical thinking and fostering collaborative learning and academic integrity. Through peer review, you can learn from each other, gain new perspectives on your work, and develop the analytical and evaluative skills, which are essential for academic success and professional development. Ten benefits of doing a peer review: Enhances critical thinking and analytical skills Peer review challenges you to critically evaluate another's work, which in turn sharpens your analytical skills. By identifying strengths, weaknesses and gaps in someone else's writing, you develop a keen eye for detail, which is invaluable in your own work and academic pursuits. Improves writing and research skills Through the process of evaluating others' research, structure and writing style, you gain insights into effective writing and research techniques. This exposure can inspire improvements in your own work, helping you to adopt best practices and avoid common pitfalls. Offers new perspectives and ideas Reviewing a peer's work exposes you to different viewpoints and methodologies, which can broaden your understanding of a subject. This exposure can stimulate creativity and innovation, encouraging you to think about your own projects in new and exciting ways.

It encourages constructive feedback and dialogue, which can lead to the development of a supportive academic network. This community can be a source of motivation, inspiration and assistance throughout your academic journey and beyond. Prepares for future academic and professional endeavours The peer review process mirrors professional scholarly review processes found in academia and research-oriented careers. Participating in peer review prepares you for these experiences, helping you to understand the dynamics of constructive criticism, revision and intellectual discourse.

We will then talk about Pascal's identity and show how Pascal's triangle can be used to workout binomial coefficients. Binomial expression is an expression consisting of two terms connected by a plus or a minus. For example, the following expressions are all binomial expressions, x plus a is a binomial expression, minus y is a binomial expression, x to the power of two minus y to the power of two is also a binomial expression, minus 3y is also a binomial expression. As we increase the power of binomials, expanding them becomes more and more complicated. For example, x plus y to the power of 1 is just x plus y. x plus y to the power of 2 is equal to x to the power of 2 plus 2xy plus y to the power of 2. x plus y to the power of 3 is equal to x to the power of 3 plus 3x to the power of 2 times y plus 3xy to the power of two plus y to the power of 3. As you can imagine, it starts to get very difficult if we want to expand a higher power binomials such as x plus y to the power of 30, for example. That's where the binomial theorem becomes very useful. So what is the binomial theorem? The binomial theorem states that given two variables x and y and a non-negative integer n, then x plus y to the power of n is equal to the sum from k equal to 0 to k equal to n of n choose k times x to the power of k times y to the power of n minus k. Let's now look at the following example. Here we want to find the coefficient of x to the power of eight times y to the power of seven in the expansion of 3x minus y to the power of 15. We can view this expression as, 3x plus minus y bracket to the power of 15. The binomial theorem allows us to describe these expression as the sum from k equal to 0 to k equal 15 of term 15 choose k times 3x to the power of k times minus y to the power of 15 minus k. Therefore, the coefficient of x to the power of eight times y to the power of seven in this expansion is obtained when the value of k is equal to eight. This is equal to 15, choose eight times three to the power of eight times minus one to the power of seven which is equal to minus three to the power of eight times 15 factorial over eight factorial times seven factorial. Let's look at an application of the binomial theorem. Here we want to show that two to the power of n is equal to the sum from k equal to 0 to k equal to n of n choose k. This formula can follow directly by applying the binomial theorem with x is equal to 1 and y is equal to 1. The binomial theorem can be used to show that the number of subsets of a set with n elements is equal to two to the power of n. Given a set with n elements. There are subsets with zero elements, with one elements, with two elements, and so on to n elements. Therefore, the total number of subsets of a set with n elements is equal to the sum from k equal to 0 to n of n choose k, which is equal to 2 to the power of n. Pascal's identity is used for the rule of combinatorics that deal with combinations or binomial coefficients. It helps us to simplify complicated binomial coefficients. Pascal's identity states that given two integers n and k with n greater than or equal to k which is greater than or equal to one, then n choose k plus n choose k minus 1 is equal to n plus 1 choose k. Let's now try to prove this identity. Let T be a set with n plus one elements and S be a subset of T containing all the element of T apart from one element a. We know that the number of subsets of T containing k elements is just n plus one choose k. Each of this subset either contains the element a with another k minus one element or contains k elements from the set S which means doesn't contain a. Therefore, there are n choose k minus one subsets of k elements containing a and n choose k subsets of k elements of T that don't contain a. Therefore, n plus one choose k is equal to n choose k minus one plus n choose k. Pascal's identity is the basis for a geometric arrangement of the binomial coefficients in a triangle which we call Pascal's triangle. Pascal's triangle is a number triangle with numbers arranged in staggered rows such that the element a_n,r is the binomial coefficient of n choose r, as you can see here. Pascal's Identity shows that the result of adding two adjacent binomial coefficients in this triangle is the binomial coefficient in the next row between these two coefficients. You can see that is the case in the example highlighted here. In this lecture, we began by introducing the binomial theorem and discussed its applications then we talked about Pascal's identity and showed how Pascal's triangle can be used to workout binomial coefficients. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 10.2 Further techniques Video: Video Binomial coefficients and identities .

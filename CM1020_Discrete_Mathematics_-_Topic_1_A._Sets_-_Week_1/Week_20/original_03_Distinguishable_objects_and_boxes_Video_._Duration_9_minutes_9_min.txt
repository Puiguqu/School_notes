In this lecture, we will look at the number of ways in which objects can be placed into boxes, where the objects can be either distinguishable or indistinguishable. Counting problems can be phrased in terms of distributing k objects into n boxes under various conditions. The objects can be either distinguishable or indistinguishable. The boxes can be either distinguishable or indistinguishable. The distribution can take place either with exclusion or without exclusion. The term distinguishable, refers to object or boxes that are marked in some way that makes each one distinguishable from the other. The term indistinguishable, refers to objects all boxes that are identical, so there is no way to tell them apart. When placing indistinguishable objects into distinguishable boxes, it makes no difference which object is placed into which box. Finally, the term with exclusion means, no box can contain more than one object, and the phrase without exclusion means that a box may contain more than one object. One of the most common ways to phrase combinatorial problem is in terms of distributing balls into boxes. Let's begin by looking at placing distinguishable balls into distinguishable boxes with exclusion. In this case, we want to distribute k balls numbered from one to k into n boxes labeled from one to n, in such way that no box receives more than one object, or one ball in this case. This is equivalent to making unordered selection of k boxes from n available boxes, where the balls do the selecting for us, as follows; the ball labeled one chooses the first box, the ball labeled two chooses the second box and so on. Distributing k distinguishable balls into n distinguishable boxes, with exclusion is equivalent to forming a permutation of size k from a set of size n. Therefore, the number of different ways of placing k distinguishable balls, into n distinguishable boxes, is equal to the number of k permutations from a set of size n, which is just n factorial over n minus k factorial. Now let's look at different ways of placing distinguishable balls into distinguishable boxes without exclusion. In this case, we want to distribute k balls numbered from one to k into n boxes, numbered from one to n without restriction on the number of balls or object in each box. This is equivalent to making an ordered selection of k boxes from n boxes with repetition, where the balls do the selection for us, as follow; the ball label one, chooses the first box, the ball label two chooses the second box, and so on. Distributing k distinguishable balls into n distinguishable boxes, without exclusion is equivalent to forming a permutation of size k from a set of size n with repetition. Therefore, there are n to the power of k different ways in this case. Now let's look at different ways of placing indistinguishable balls into distinguishable boxes with exclusion. In this case, we want to distribute k balls, into n boxes, numbered from one to n, in such way that no box receives more than one ball. Distributing k indistinguishable balls, into 'n distinguishable boxes, with exclusion is equivalent to forming a combination of a size k from a set of a size n. Therefore, there are n factorial over k factorial, times n minus k factorial, different way of placing indistinguishable balls into distinguishable boxes with exclusion. Now let's look at different ways of placing indistinguishable balls into distinguishable boxes without exclusion. In this case, we want to distribute k balls into n boxes numbered from one to n without restriction, on the number of balls in each box. Distributing k indistinguishable balls into n distinguishable boxes without exclusion, is equivalent to forming a combination of size k from a set of size n with repetition. Therefore, there are n plus k minus one factorial over k factorial times n minus one factorial, different way of distributing k indistinguishable balls into n distinguishable boxes without exclusion. Consider the following question. How many ways are there of placing eight indistinguishable balls into six distinguishable boxes? Now let's try to solve this problem. The number of ways of placing eight indistinguishable balls into six distinguishable boxes equals to the number of eight combination from a set of six element when repetition is permitted. Therefore, the number of ways of placing eight indistinguishable balls into six distinguishable boxes is equal to 13 choose eight, which is equal to 1,287. In this lecture, we saw how we can model some counting problems by distributing objects into boxes. We looked at placing distinguishable objects, into distinguishable boxes with and without exclusion. We also looked at placing indistinguishable objects into distinguishable boxes again with and without exclusion. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 10.2 Further techniques Video: Video Binomial coefficients and identities .

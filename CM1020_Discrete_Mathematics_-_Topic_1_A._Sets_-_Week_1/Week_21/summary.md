## Final exam key concepts review Reading• . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/supplement/2isrl/final-exam-key-concepts-review)

This text appears to be a comprehensive overview of various mathematical concepts, including discrete mathematics, graph theory, Boolean algebra, and algorithms. Here's a breakdown of what each section covers:

1. **Discrete Mathematics**: This includes topics such as combinations, permutations, relations, partial orders, total orders, and more.
2. **Graph Theory**: Graphs are structures composed of vertices connected by edges, and this section covers various aspects, including Euler paths and cycles, Hamiltonian paths, and graph algorithms like Dijkstra's Algorithm.
3. **Boolean Algebra**: This is a branch of mathematics dealing with operations on logical values, including binary variables, constants, and logical operations. The fundamental operations are conjunction (∧), disjunction (∨), and complement (¬).
4. **Algorithms**: Algorithms are step-by-step procedures for performing computations. Discrete Mathematics primarily studies algorithms related to graphs, trees, and other data structures.

Some notable topics not explicitly mentioned in this text include:

* **Combinatorial Optimization**: This includes problems like the traveling salesman problem, knapsack problem, and more.
* **Graph Minimization Problems**: These are problems where the goal is to find an optimal solution among a set of feasible solutions. Examples include minimum spanning tree, shortest path algorithms, and minimum cut problems.
* **Set Theory**: This includes topics like power sets, cardinality, and relations.

If you're looking for resources on these topics, here are some suggestions:

* For Discrete Mathematics:
	+ "Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications" by Kenneth H. Rosen
	+ "Introduction to Combinatorics" by Mark Ross, John E. Taylor, and David J. Wright
* For Graph Theory:
	+ "Graph Theory" by Douglas B. West
	+ "Network Flow Problems: A Survey of Large-Scale Network Optimization"
* For Boolean Algebra:
	+ "Boolean Algebra and Its Applications" by R. D. Blackstock
	+ "Introduction to Boolean Algebras and Their Application in Digital Electronics"
* For Algorithms:
	+ "Introduction to Algorithms" by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein
	+ "Algorithms: A Practical Introduction" by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne

Keep in mind that these resources are just a starting point, and there are many more books, online courses, and tutorials available to help you explore each topic further.

Do you have any specific questions about discrete mathematics or graph theory? I'd be happy to try and assist you.

## Final exam study guide Reading• . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/supplement/Mgtp5/final-exam-study-guide)

Here is a summary of the text in 10 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Set Theory: The definition of sets includes elements, subsets, power sets, and cardinality. Set operations include union, intersection, difference, complement, set-builder notation, and set identities. In Predicate Logic, propositions are distinguished from statements, and quantifiers such as universal and existential quantification are used to interpret logical expressions. Functions and Relations involve understanding function types (injective, surjective, bijective), determining function one-to-one or onto, finding inverses, plotting functions on graphs, and interpreting relations.

Combinations and Permutations use principles of permutations and combinations to determine possible outcomes of events. Graph Theory involves Eulerian cycles/paths, Hamiltonian cycles/paths, graph properties, and degree sequences. Boolean Algebra involves designing and interpreting logical gates, simplifying expressions, and resolving problems using induction proofs and other methods.

Mathematical Proofs and Recursion involve understanding different proof types (induction, contrapositive, contradiction) and identifying base cases and general cases in recursively defined problems. Finally, Algorithms use techniques such as Dijkstra's Algorithm to solve problems efficiently, with practice exams and study guides available for review.

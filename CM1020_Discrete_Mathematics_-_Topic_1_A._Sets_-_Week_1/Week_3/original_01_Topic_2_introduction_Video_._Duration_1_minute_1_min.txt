For instance, a plant's growth depends on how much sunlight and rainfall it is exposed to. A runner's speed depends on the time it takes them to run a distance. Voltage depends on the resistance and the electric current. A function is a rule that relates to how one quantity depends on other quantities. It is a relation between a set of inputs and a set of outputs in which each input maps to exactly one output. The concept of a function is a central to computer programming. Most of what a programmer writes, consists of a function that are part of the work of the program. In this topic, we will introduce functions, as well as examining a number of function properties. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Video: Video Topic 2 introduction .

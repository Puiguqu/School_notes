The concept of a function is central to computer programming. Most of what a programmer writes consists of functions that do parts of the work of the program. In this lecture, we will cover the following: the definition of a function, the domain, co-domain, and range of a function, and the image and pre-image or antecedent of an element. We saw in the previous topic that a set is a collection of objects, numbers, letters etc. A function maps an element of a set to an element in another set. For example, this function takes an element of the set 1 and maps it to an element of the set 2. A function is a well-behaved relation. That is, given a starting point we know exactly where to go. Now, let's have a look at an example of how this works in practice. Let set 1 be the set containing the following strings; sea, land, and sky, and let the set 2 be the set containing positive integers from 1-6. This function maps or string to it's corresponding number of characters. It maps the string sea and sky to three as they both consists of three characters. On the other hand, land contains four character and hence it is mapped to four. A function f from a set A to set B is an assignment of exactly one element of B to each element of A. This can be written as f colon A arrow B which can be read as f maps A to B. For an input x in A, we get an output y in B. We write f of x is equal to y. Let's now look at some of the terminology used in functions. Given a function from a set A to set B where an element x of A is mapped to an element y of B. A is the set of all input and it is called the domain of f, we write this as D_f. B is the set containing all possible outputs and is called the co-domain of f, it is written as co-D_f. The set containing all the outputs is called the range of f, it is written as R_f. An element x of the set A is mapped to an element y of the set B. In this case, we write f of x is equal to y. Y is called the image of x whereas x is called the pre-image of y. Now, let's take a look at an example that illustrates the domain, the co-domain, and range of a function. Here we have a function which maps a string to it's corresponding number of characters, as defined from a set A to a set B. As you can see, the string on is mapped to two, the string sky and string sea are mapped to three, and the string land is mapped to four. The domain of f is just the set of all inputs and is equal to A. The co-domain of f is a set containing all possible outputs and it's equal to B. The range of f is the set of all images or outputs. In other words, the set of all elements of B which have pre-images in A. So in this case, the range of f contains only three elements: two, three, and four. In this example, the function f takes an input x in A and outputs plus 1 in B. For example, for an input 0, output is 1. For an input 1, the output is 3. So the domain of the function f is just A, the co-domain of the function f is just B, whereas the range of f is the set of images which is the set containing the elements 1,3,5,7,9 in this case. Now, let's look again at the previous example, the function that maps a string to it's corresponding number of characters. Two is the image of the string on. To show this, we write f of the string on is equal to 2. On is the pre-image of two, hence the pre-images of two is the set containing the string on. Sea and sky have the same image 3. To show this, we write f of sea is equal to 3 and f of sky is equal to 3. Sky and sea are both pre-images of three hence pre-images of three is the set containing two strings: sky and sea. So here is a summary of what we talked about so far. F is a function from A to B. A is the domain of f, B is the co-domain of f. Here's an element x of A and function f maps x to y, we write the image of x and we write f of x is equal to y. So y is the image of x and we write f of x is equal to y. X is the pre-image of y. As we said, the range of the function f is A subset of the set B as the range is the set of all outputs. So this set here which is a subset of B consists of all the elements of the range of f. Now, let's take a look at this example of a relation that is not a function. The relation here maps exam marks to their corresponding students. This relation is not a function for two reason: for a function, every input must have an image. But here, the input 65 has no image. Secondly, both 62 and 70 are mapped to more than one image, which is not true in the case of a function for which every input must have one unique output or image. However, this relation which maps students name to that corresponding exam marks is a function, as each student's name is mapped to one unique exam. Now, I'm going to ask you to attempt an exercise that summarizes some of what you have learned in this lecture. Here, the function f is defined from Z to Z, set of all integers. It maps each element of Z to its corresponding absolute value. You need to find the domain, the co-domain, and range of the function f, as well as the set of pre-images of the element 1. Now, pause the video and try to answer these questions. By definition both the domain and the co-domain of the function f are equal to Z in this case. The range of f is all integers greater than or equal to 0. The image of minus 1 is the absolute value of minus 1 which is 1, and the image of 1 which is the absolute value of 1 which is 1. Hence the set of pre-images of one is the set containing two elements minus 1 and 1. Let's have a go at another exercise. Here the function g is defined from a set of a real number to a set real number. A maps each element of x of R to x squared plus 1. You need to define the domain, the co-domain, and the range of the function g as well as the set of pre-images of five. Now, pause the video and have a try to answer these questions. By definition, both the domain and the co-domain of the function g are equal to R. For every element x of R, x square is greater than or equal to 0. Hence, x squared plus 1 is greater or equal to 1. Therefore, the range of the function g is the set of real numbers greater than or equal to 1. G of minus 2 in this case is minus 2 squared plus 1 which is equal to 5, g of 2 is 2 squared plus 1 which is also equal to 5. Hence the set of pre-images of five is the set containing two elements: minus two and two. In this lesson, we defined a function as a rule that assigns each element of a set to only one element of another set, we also explained via examples how to find the domain, the co-domain, and range of a function, finally, we looked at the images and pre-images of elements. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Video: Video Topic 2 introduction .

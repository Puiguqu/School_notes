Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key In this lecture, we will explore some special function and plot their corresponding graphs. This includes linear functions, quadratic functions, and exponential functions. A function f is called a linear function if it is of the form, f(x) = ax + b, where a and b are real numbers. This type of function is a straight line, which passes through the points of coordinates (0,b) and has a as its gradient. Here is a function f with f(x) = ax + b. If the gradient of the function f, a is a positive, then the function is an increasing function. That is, given two inputs, x1 and x2, if x1 is less or equal to x2, then f(x1) is less or equal to f(x2). Now, let's have a look at an example of an increasing linear function. Here is a function f with f(x) is equal 3 times x plus 2. In order to plot this function, we first make a table for the function. Then we complete the table using the function rule. To plot this function, it suffices to plot two points from the function table and join them with a straight line. Hence, the graph of this function is as follows. As you can see from the graph, the function f is an increasing function. A linear function with a negative gradient is a decreasing function. That is, given two inputs x1 and x2, if x1 is less or equal to x2, then f(x1) is greater than or equal to f(x2). Now, let's have a look at an example of a decreasing linear function. The following linear function f(x) is equal to minus 3 times x plus 2 has a negative gradient, which is equal to minus 3. The function table and a graph of this function are shown here. The graph clearly shows that this function f is a decreasing function. We now look at a different type of function called quadratic functions. A function of the form f(x) is equal to a times x square plus b times x plus c, where a, b, and c are real numbers, and a different from 0 is called a quadratic function. Here, we see an example of a quadratic function, f(x) is equal to x square. In this case, a is equal to 1, whereas b and c are equal to 0. The function table and the graph of this function are given. The graph of this function, clearly shows that it is decreasing for negative values of x, then starts to increase once x reaches the value 0. As you can see, the domain of the function f is the set of all real numbers, whereas the range of the function f is just the set of real positive numbers. Here is another example of a quadratic function, g(x) is equal to x squared plus 1. In this case, a and c are equal to 1, whereas b is equal to 0. Clearly, the function g is just the function f seen in the previous slide, plus 1. This can be seen in the graph of the function g, which is just a shift of the graph of the function f, up the y axis by 1. As you can see, the domain of the function g is the set of all real numbers, whereas the range of the function g is just the set of real numbers greater than or equal to 1. In this example, we show the plots of the function f(x) is equal to ax square, with different values of a. a is equal to 1/2, a is equal to 1/4, a is equal to minus 1/2, and a is equal to minus 1/4. The graph shows that the plot of ax squared and minus ax squared are symmetric with respect to the x-axis. An exponential function is of the form f(x) is equal b to the power of x, where b is greater than 0 and b is different from 1. The variable b is called the base of the function. For example, if the base is equal to 2, f(x) is equal 2 to the power of x. And hence, the value of f(2) is equal 2 to the power of 2, which is equal to 4. If the base is equal to a half, then f(x) equals a half to the power of x. Hence f(2) is a half to the power of 2, which is equal to a quarter. We now look at some laws of the exponential function. The first one is b to the power of x times b to the power of y, this is equal just to the b to the power of x + y. The second one is b to the power of x over b to the power of y, which is just b to the power of x- y. The third one is b to the power of x, the whole thing to the power of y, this is just equal to b to the power of x times y. The fourth one is a times b to the power of x, this is just a total power of x times b to the power of x. The next one is a over b to the power of x, this is just a to the power of x over b to the power of x. And finally, b to the power of minus x is just 1 over b to the power of x. If the base b is greater than 1, then the function is increasing and represents a growth as shown in this graph. This graph also shows that the point (0,1) is a common point. The domain and the range are also given. The domain is equal to the set of all real numbers, whereas the range is equal to the set of all the real positive numbers. As you can see, the x axis is a horizontal asymptote to the curve of the function. Now, let's take a look at an example of an exponential growth function. In this case, the base is equal to 2. We can clearly see that the curve of the function is increasing and passes through the point (0,1). The x-axis represents an asymptote to the curve of the function. If the base b is less than 1, then the function is decreasing and represents a decay as shown in this graph. This graph also shows that the point (0,1) is the common point. As you can see, the domain and the range in this case are the same as in the case of an exponential growth. Also, the x-axis is a horizontal asymptote to the curve of the function. Here, we see an example of an exponential decay with the base equal to half. We can clearly see that the curve of the function decreases and passes through the point (0,1). The x-axis represents an asymptote to the curve of the function. In this lecture, we covered linear increasing and decreasing functions, quadratic functions, and exponential growth and decay functions. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Video: Video Topic 2 introduction .

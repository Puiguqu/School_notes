In which case we described the function as an injective or one-to-one. The second function property is surjection. In which case we described the function as surjective or onto. Let's now have a closer look at the first function property which is injection. Let F be a function from a set A to a set B, f is said to be injective or one-to-one function if and only if any two different input will lead to two different outputs. This means that given any two different inputs a and b of the set A, then the image of a is different from the image of b. This is equivalent to saying but if two elements a and b have the same image then a and b must be equal to each other. To show that the function is not injective, we only need to find two different inputs with the same image. Let's have a look at an example of two functions, one of which is injective whereas the other is not. Here we can clearly see that the function f is injective or one-to-one function, as each element of A has its own unique image. However, the function G is not Injective or not one-to-one for 2 reasons. The first one, 2 and 4 are different, but they have the same image. The same is true for the inputs 1 and 3. Now let's have a look at an example of a linear function and show that it is injective. We Can show this using two ways. First Let's take two elements a and b of the domain R and assumed the image of a and the image of b are the same, then show that a is equal to b. Now by assuming that the image of a is equal to the image of b, this means that 2a+3=2b+3. Always we substitute a x by a, and the second one we substitute x by b. This means that 2a is equal to 2b. We just simplify the expression by getting rid of 3 from both sides of the equality. This means a is equal to b, therefore, the function is injective. We talked to elements a and b, we assume that they have the same image, and we just showed that those elements can't be different. They have to be the same. Or we can use the second proof, we take two elements a and b of the domain or and we assume that those two elements are different. a different from b, then show the image of a is must be different from the image of b. Well, we start from a different from b. This means that 2 times a is different from 2 times b. Then we can add three from both sides. This means that two times a+3 is different from two times b+3. This allows us to say that f(a) is different from f(b). Therefore, f is an injective function. Now let's have a look at an example of a quadratic function that is not an injection. I'm going to show you how to prove that a function f defined from R to R with f(x) is equal to x squared is not injective. We only need to find one counter example to show that this function is not injective or one-to-one. To do this, we need to find two different elements that have the same image. In this case, each positive number and its corresponding negative number have the same image, f(5) is equal to 5 square and f(-5) is equal to -5 square, they both equal to 25. In other words, two different elements have the same image. This can be clearly seen using the curve of the function, hence it is not an injective function. However, if we change the domain of the previous function from R to R plus the function becomes injective and this can be shown as follow. Similarly as the previous function, we can use two way to prove that this function is not injective. So to be injective if you take any two elements a and b, and if the image of a is equal to the image of b, then a must be equal to b. Okay, let's assume that f(a) is equal to f(b). This employees that a square is equal to b square. Clearly this employ that a must be equal to b us and be are all elements of R plus, means there are a positive real numbers that for the function is injective or we can use the other proof. Let's a and b our element of the domain which is R plus. And assume that we have two elements a and b which are different than prove that their image has to be different as well. We start from the assumption of two elements a and b are different. This means that a square and b square are different. Again, there are different as a and b or real positive numbers. This means that f(a) is different from f(b) and therefore the function f is an injective function. Now let's take a look at the second function property which is surjection. Let f be a function from the set A to a set B. f is said to be a surjective or an onto function, if and only if every element of the co-domain will be has at least one per image in the domain of f, A. This means that given any element y of B, there exists an element x of A such that y is the image of x. This is equivalent to say that the range and the co-domain of a surjective function are the same. Let's have a look at an example of two functions, one of which is surjective, whereas the other is not. We can clearly see here that the function f is surjective or onto as each element of B has at least one per image in A, or the co-domain and the range of this function are the same. However, the function g is not surjective or onto for two reasons, firstly the element of 2 in B has now pre-images in a. The same is also true for the element 3 in B. We can clearly see the domain of G is different from the range of G, which means that the function G is not surjective. Now let's have a look at an example of a linear function and prove that is surjective. To show that this function is surjective, we need to show that for any element y in the co-domain of the function f that exist an element x in the domain such that f(x)=y. In another way, y is the image of x. We start by the assumption f(x)=y. This implies that +3=y. This implies that =y -3. Therefore, x is equal to y-3, which is an element of R. Then for any element y we can find an element x which is just y -3 over 2, such the f(x)=y. Which means like if you take an element y in a co-domain, you can find an element x in the domain of the function such the y is just the image of x. Therefore, for every element y in the co-domain of the function f there exist an element x in the domain of the function such that y is the image of x, hence the function is surjective. Now let's have a look at an example of a quadratic function that is not surjective. Now, let's show that the function f defines from R to R with f(x) is equal to X square is not surjective. For a function to be subjective, every element of the co-domain has to have at least one pre-image in the domain. The co-domain of this function is equal to R. As you can see the co-domain here of this function is R. However, all the images are either 0 or positive as x square is equal to 0. If x is 0 and positive is if f is different from 0. Therefore, all the elements of the range of f are either 0 or a positive real number, which is different from the co-domain of the function f which is equal to R. The co-domain of this function is equal to R. So we can see here, f is defined from R to R, therefore, the co-domain is equal to R. However, as it's seen in the graph here, all negative numbers in a co-domain have no pre-images. Therefore we can say that this function is not a surjective function. Yeah, because its forces to find one element in the co-domain which has no per-image. Therefore, the function is not surjective. Or you can say that the range of a function is different from the co-domain of a function. That will lead us to say that the function is not a surjective function. As we come to the end of this lecture, let's recap what you have learned about injective and surjective functions with some examples. The first example, this function is injective but it's not surjective. It's injected because each element in the domain has a unique image. It's not surjective because the element 2 in the co-domain has no pre-image. In this example the function is surjective by it's not injective. It's subjective because every element in the co-domain has a pre-image, at least one pre-image. However, a and d have the same image. So a and d are different but they have the same image which is 2 which makes this function not injective. This function is injective and surjective. As you can see, each element in the domain has a unique image and each element in the CO domain has at least one pre-image. Therefore, this function is injective and surjective. So in this example the function is neither injected nor surjective. It's not injective for the fact that a and c have the same image. It's not surjective as four element of the co-omain has no pre-image. Finally this is not a valid function for one reason, the reason is, the the input a has two outputs which is not allowed in functions. For it to be a function, each input has to have one outpu, so it's not allowed to have more than one output for a single input in function. So this is not a valid function. So we can't talk about injective or surjective because it's not a function in the first place. In this lecture we used examples to explain two important properties of functions, injective or one-to-one functions, and surjective or onto functions. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Video: Video Topic 2 introduction .

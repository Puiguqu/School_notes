Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

A function is a rule that relates one quantity to another, where each input maps to exactly one output. Functions are a fundamental concept in computer programming and are used extensively in writing programs. A plant's growth, for example, depends on factors such as sunlight and rainfall, while a runner's speed depends on the time taken to run a distance. Voltage is also dependent on resistance and electric current.

In mathematics, functions are used to model relationships between variables. The concept of a function is central to computer programming and most programs consist of functions that work together to achieve a goal. To be considered a valid function, it must satisfy certain properties, including being one-to-one (injective) or onto (surjective).

Injective functions map each input to exactly one output, while surjective functions ensure every output has at least one corresponding input. Functions can also be categorized as even or odd based on their behavior under symmetry operations.

In this topic, we will introduce functions and examine various properties, including plotting functions, injective and surjective functions, and more. We will explore how functions are used in computer programming and review essential reading material. The goal of this topic is to provide a comprehensive understanding of functions and their applications in mathematics and computer science.

Overall, functions play a crucial role in modeling relationships between variables and are an essential tool for problem-solving in both mathematics and computer programming.

## The definition of a function Video• . Duration: 11 minutes 11 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/wAGof/the-definition-of-a-function)

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

A function is a relation between a set of inputs (called the domain) and a set of outputs (called the co-domain). The output for each input is unique. A function can be represented as f(x), where x is an element of the domain and f(x) is an element of the co-domain.

The range of a function is the subset of the co-domain that contains all possible outputs of the function. To find the range, we need to determine the set of values that the output takes for each input.

To find the pre-image of an element in the co-domain, we need to find the input that produces that output. In other words, we need to solve the equation f(x) = y for x.

A function can be injective (one-to-one), meaning that no two different inputs produce the same output. A function can also be surjective (onto), meaning that every element in the co-domain has a corresponding input in the domain.

For example, consider the function f: Z -> Z defined by f(x) = |x|. The domain of this function is all integers, and the range is all non-negative integers. To find the pre-image of 1, we need to solve |x| = 1 for x, which gives us x = -1 or x = 1.

In summary, a function is a relation between two sets that assigns each element of one set to exactly one element of another set. The range of a function is the subset of the co-domain that contains all possible outputs, and the pre-image of an element in the co-domain is the input that produces that output.

Here are some key points to take away from this lesson:

* Definition of a function
* Finding the domain, co-domain, and range of a function
* Pre-images of elements in the co-domain
* Injective and surjective functions

To practice what you have learned, try completing the exercises provided in the video.

## Plotting functions Video• . Duration: 9 minutes 9 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/LJ9wV/plotting-functions)

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

A function f is called linear if it is of the form f(x) = ax + b, where a and b are real numbers. The gradient of the function f, a, determines whether the function is increasing or decreasing. If a is positive, the function is increasing, and if a is negative, the function is decreasing.

A quadratic function is of the form f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c, where a, b, and c are real numbers and a ≠ 0. The graph of a quadratic function is a parabola that opens upwards or downwards depending on the value of a.

An exponential function is of the form f(x) = b^x, where b > 0 and b ≠ 1. The variable b is called the base of the function.

The laws of exponential functions include:

* b^x * b^y = b^(x+y)
* b^x / b^y = b^(x-y)
* (b^x) * y = b^((x)y)
* a * b^x = (a*b)^x
* a/b^x = a/(b^x)

If the base b is greater than 1, the function is increasing and represents growth. If the base b is less than 1, the function is decreasing and represents decay.

The domain of an exponential function is the set of all real numbers. The range of an exponential function depends on the value of the base and can be the set of all positive real numbers or other intervals.

## Injective and surjective functions Video• . Duration: 14 minutes 14 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/XyWA9/injective-and-surjective-functions)

This transcript appears to be a lecture on functions, specifically focusing on injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto) properties of functions. The speaker guides the audience through several key concepts and provides examples to illustrate these ideas.

Here are the main points covered in this lecture:

1. **Definition of Functions**: The lecturer emphasizes that for every input in a function, there is exactly one output. This is crucial for defining what constitutes a valid function.
2. **Injective (One-to-One) Functions**: Injective functions are those where each element in the domain maps to a unique element in the range. The speaker provides examples of injective functions and highlights their key characteristics, including that no two different elements in the domain map to the same element in the range.
3. **Surjective (Onto) Functions**: Surjective functions are those where every element in the co-domain is mapped by at least one element from the domain. The speaker discusses how surjectivity ensures that every possible output value is covered, making it useful for applications involving exhaustive coverage of all possibilities.

The lecture also includes several practical exercises and video segments to reinforce understanding through examples:

- **Video Topic 2 Introduction**: Introduces the topic of injective and surjective functions, setting the stage for further exploration.
- **Plotting Functions**: Demonstrates how to plot simple functions on a coordinate plane, aiding in visualizing their behavior.
- **Injective and Surjective Functions Video**: Explores both injective and surjective functions through detailed explanations and examples.
- **Practice Assignments**: Provides exercises for reinforcing understanding of the concepts covered in the lecture.

Finally, the transcript includes recommendations for further learning and practice:

- **Reading Material**: Lists recommended readings on injective and surjective functions to supplement the lecture material.
- **Peer-Assessment Activity**: Encourages audience participation by suggesting a peer-assessment activity that tests understanding of functions beyond mere theoretical knowledge.
- **Review Materials**: Offers review materials, including problem sheets and solutions, to help reinforce learning.

This comprehensive approach to teaching functional properties ensures that learners grasp these fundamental concepts in mathematics, which are essential for further study in various mathematical disciplines.

## Injective and surjective functions Reading• . Duration: 15 minutes 15 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/supplement/t9YrS/injective-and-surjective-functions)

## Step 1: Understanding Injective Functions
An injective function, also known as a one-to-one function, is a function where every element of the codomain is mapped to at most one element from the domain.

## Step 2: Understanding Surjective Functions
A surjective function, also known as an onto function, is a function where every element in the codomain is mapped by at least one element from the domain.

## Step 3: Understanding Bijective Functions
A bijective function is both injective and surjective. This means that every element in the codomain is mapped to exactly one element from the domain.

## Step 4: Analyzing Examples of Injective, Surjective, and Bijective Functions
We can analyze examples such as f(1)=a, f(2)=b, f(3)=c for injectivity, g(1)=a, g(2)=a, g(3)=b for non-injectivity, h(1)=a, h(2)=b, h(3)=c for surjectivity, and i(1)=a, i(2)=b, i(3)=c for bijectivity.

## Step 5: Drawing Conclusions
From the analysis of examples, we can conclude that injective functions map each element in the domain to at most one element in the codomain, surjective functions map each element in the codomain to at least one element in the domain, and bijective functions are both injective and surjective.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$

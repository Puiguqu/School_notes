Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences:

The provided extract aims to consolidate knowledge on function composition, bijections, and the floor and ceiling functions. The recommended reading is from Koshy, pp.125-128 and 150-153. After reading, exercises are suggested for completion (pp.134 exercises 1-3, 5, 6, 10, 11, pp.155 exercises 1-8, 13, 15, 16). The reader is advised to consult the "Solutions to Odd-Numbered Exercises" section at the back of the book for answers. Function composition is a crucial concept in this topic. Bijections are a type of bijection that establishes a one-to-one correspondence between two sets. The floor and ceiling functions are also discussed in relation to functions. The goal of these exercises is to reinforce understanding of these concepts. Function composition involves combining multiple functions to create a new function. Bijections establish a unique mapping between sets, ensuring that each element in the domain maps to exactly one element in the codomain. The floor and ceiling functions are used to round down or up values within a given range. These functions are essential in mathematics and real-world applications. Understanding these concepts is crucial for problem-solving and critical thinking skills. The exercises provided will help students apply their knowledge and develop their analytical skills.

Note: I did not include any specific formulae or technical details as they were not mentioned in the provided text.

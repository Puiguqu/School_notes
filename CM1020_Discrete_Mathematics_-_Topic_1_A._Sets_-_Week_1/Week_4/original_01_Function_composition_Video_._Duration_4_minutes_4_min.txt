Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key In this lecture, we will use examples to explain the function composition on how to work out the composition of two functions. We will also show that the composition of relation is not commutative. Let's begin by taking a look at function composition, living two functions F and G, the composition of F and G written as F, O G of X is just F of G of X. The function composition, F of G of X can be worked out in two stages. In the first stage, we input X to the function G and get G of X as output, in the second stage, we use the output of the function G as an input to the function F, and get F of G of X. Here is an example of two functions F and G, where the output of the function F is just double the input and the output of G a just the input squared to find out F of G of X. We first get the output of the function G which is just X square. Then use the output of G, which is X square as an input to the function F. As a result of this, we get F of G of X is equal to two times X squared. Now let's take a look at a visualization of function composition. Here we have three sets A, B, and C. A function G is defined from A to B and the function F is defined from B to C, take an element of A. So, we apply G to A and we get G of A is in B. We then apply F to G of A and we get F of G of A, which is an element of C. Therefore, by applying F of G on the element A, we get F of G of A. So here's an example of function composition. We've got F of X is equal to two X plus three, and we got G of X is equal to three X plus two. So G is from R to R, and F is also from R to R. So you can see that the three sets here are all equal to R, so if we take one as an element of R, and we apply G and A, so we'll get G of one, which is just three times one plus two, which is five. Then we apply F on five and we get F of G of one, which is just F of five, which is two times five plus three, which is 13. So we just can say that F of G of one is equal to 13. The function composition is not commutative. As F of G is different from G of F, this means that if we change the order of the functions F and G, then we get a different function. Now I'm going to demonstrate this through an example given the following functions F and G. When can clearly see that F of G of X is equal to two times X squared, whereas G of F of X is equal to four X squared. Therefore the composition of a function is not commutative. In this lecture we are introduced and explain how to work out the composition of two functions. We also show that the function composition relation is not commutative. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 2.2 More about functions Video: Video Function composition .

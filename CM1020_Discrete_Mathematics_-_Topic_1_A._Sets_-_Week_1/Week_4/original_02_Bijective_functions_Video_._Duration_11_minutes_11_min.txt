Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key In this lecture we will explore another function property, this property is bijection, in which case we describe a function as a bijective or invertible. We then explain how to find the inverse function, we will also explain the relationship between the graph of a function and that of its corresponding inverse function. The following function is clearly injective and surjective, as each element of the codomain has a unique pre-image, such a function is called a bijective or an invertible function. A function is set to be bijective or invertible if and only if it is both injective, an subjective, to show that the function is a bijection or is bijective, we only need to show that it is both injective and surjective. For example, the function f shown here is both injective and surjective, hence it is bijective or invertible function. However, the function g is not bijective function as it is not surjective because the element 2 has no pre-image. The function h is not a bijective function as it isn't injective because the element a and d have the same image. Now I'm going to give you an exercise that summarizes what you now know about bijection. We need to show that this function f is bijective or invertible, therefore we need to show that the function f is both injective and surjective. Pause the video now on half ago at proving this, now let's prove that f is injective. So let a and b be 2 elements of the domain, which is all we need to show that if a is different from be then f(a) is different from f(b). We start by a different from b, this implies 2a is different from 2b, this implies that 2a+3 is different from 2b+3, which implies f(a) is different for me from f(b) therefore f is injective. Now let's show the f is surjective, so to show this, we need to show that for each element y in the codomain of f, there exists an element x in a domain of f such that f(x) is equal to y. So we start by f(x) is equal to y, this implies that +3=y, so all what we have done is substitute f(x) by its expression. This implies that = y-3, which imply that x= y- 3 over 2, which is always an element of R, therefore, for every element, y in R there exists x, which is y- 3 over 2 such that y = f(x). Hence, the function f is surjective, we have shown that the function f is both injective and surjective, hence f is a bijective function. Now let's look at what we mean by an inverse function, let f be a function which maps elements of a set A to elements of a set B. If f is bijective or invertible, then the inverse function refer to as f-1 exists and is defined as follow. f-1 is a function from B to A, the inverse function maps element of the set B to element of the set A. Here is an example of an inverse function, here is a function f defined from a set A t Set B will only does is times the input by 2, so 0, 2 times 0, 0 for an input 1, 2 * 1 is 2, 2 * 2 is 4, 2 * 3 is 6. 2 * 4 is 8. So this function is injective and surjective. Therefore the inverse function exists. So the inverse function if F times the input by 2 then re inverse function will half for the input. So F- 1 of X is just X / 2, so for 0, F minus 1 of 0 is 0 / 2 which is 0. F- 1 of 2 is 2 / 2 which is 1, F minus 1 of 4 is 4 over 2 which is 2, F minus 1 of 6 is 6 / 2 which is 3, F- 1 of 8 which is 8 / 2 which is 4. So as we can see here, the domain of the function F is A and the codomain is B, whereas for F- 1 the domain is B. And the codomain is A, what really the inverse function does is it reverses the effect of the function F. Let's take a look at a visualization of an inverse function. Here we have an example of a function F which is just equal 2 * X F of X is 2 * X. This function is defined from R to R. So. The inverse function F- 1, if it exists, is defined from. R to R, so F is defined from here to here whereas F- 1 is defined from here to here. So F - 1 / X is just X / 2. F of X is 2 * X, whereas F- 1 the inverse function is X / 2. For example, you've got an element 4 here F of 4 is 2 * 4, which is 8. We can write that F- 1 of 8 is just 4. Now I'm going to give you an exercise that asks you to find the inverse function of a function. We have already seen the function F here at the beginning of this lesson, and we prove that it is a bijective function. Hence the inverse function F - 1 exists. We now need to show how we find the inverse function of the function F. We have already shown that the function F is injective and surjective. To find the inverse function we need to put F of X is equal to Y on. Try to find X in terms of Y. So F of X is equal to Y. Implies. The 2X. Plus 3 is equal to Y, which implies that 2X is equal to y- 3, which imply the X is equal to y- 3 over 2. therefore the inverse function in this case, is F- 1. Is defined from R to R as both domain and codomain of F, both are equal to R&X has gotten an image F- 1 of X, which is just X- 3 / 2. If a function F is invertible, then F of F - 1 of X is equal to F - 1 / F of X which equal to X, which is the identity function. Now I'm going to explain this in more detail. So here is a function that we have seen before. F is defined from R to R with F of X is equal 2 * X. As we have seen before, this function is invertible. An F- 1 is defined from R to R with F- 1 of X is equal to just X / 2. So F of F- 1 of X. Is equal F of F- 1 of X is equal F of X / 2 as we substitute F- 1 of X by just X / 2. So F of X / 2 is just 2 * X / 2 which is just X. Similarly F- 1 of F of X is just F- 1 of 2X all what we have done is substitute F of X by 2X and then apply F- 1. So we have 2 * X / 2 which is equal to X. So we've just shown in this example by F of F- 1 of X is equal to F- 1 / F of X is equal to X. Let's take a look at how inverse functions are plotted on a graph. The curves of a function F and that of its inverse function F- 1 are always symmetric with respect to the straight line, Y is equal to X. This is clearly shown in this graph, where the curve of the function F of X is equal to 2X in green. The symmetric with respect to the line Y is equal to X. To that of its corresponding inverse function, F - 1 in blue, which is X / 2 in this case. In this lesson, we explain what it means to say that a function is bijection. How to prove that function is bijective? On how to find the inverse function. We also explain the relation that links the curve of a function and that of its corresponding inverse function. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 2.2 More about functions Video: Video Function composition .

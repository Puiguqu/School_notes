Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key In this lecture we will revisit exponential function. We will also introduce logarithmic functions and explain their relation to exponential functions. As we have already seen in an earlier lecture an exponential function is of the form f of x equal b^x where b is strictly greater than zero and b is different from one. The variable b is called the base. For example, if the base is equal to 2, f of x is equal 2^x hence for x is equal to 3, f of x which is equal to f of 3, is 2^3 which is equal to 8. As we have seen before, the first graph here shows exponential growth, which the base is equal to two which is greater than one. Whereas the second graph shows exponential decay as the base is equal to half which is less than one. We now look at some properties of the exponential functions. F of x is equal b^x where b is strictly greater than zero and b is different from one. The domain is a set of all real numbers. The range is the set of all positive real numbers. The graph of an exponential function always passes through the point with coordinates 0, 1. If the base is greater than one then the function is increasing, this is called an exponential growth. However, if the base is strictly less than one then the function is decreasing, this is called an exponential decay. We now define another function called the logarithmic function. The logarithmic function with base b where b is strictly greater than zero, and b is different from one is defined as follows. We write log of x in the base b is equal to y if and only if x is equal to b^y. The exponential function is the by a bijection as it is injective and surjective, hence its inverse function exists. The logarithm function with base b is just the inverse function of the exponential function with base b. We now show how to convert from the logarithmic form to the exponential form and vice versa. As I have just said the logarithmic function with the base b is the inverse of the exponential function with the base b. As you can see the base is the same in both the logarithmic form and the exponential form. For example, 81 is equal to 3^4. This is equivalent to say the log of 81 in the base 3 is equal to 4. Similarly log of 16 in the base 2 is equal to 4 is equivalent to say that 16 is equal to 2^4. Let's now look at some laws of logarithmic functions. The logarithm of m times n is equal to the logarithm of m plus the logarithm of n. The logarithm of m over n is equal to the logarithm of m minus the logarithm of n. The logarithm of m^n is equal to n times the logarithm of m. The logarithm of one is always equal to zero. Whereas the logarithm of a base is always equal to one. Let's now look at how these laws of logarithmic functions are used in practice. Let's try to work out the logarithm of 81 in the base 3. The logarithm of 81 in base 3 is equal to the logarithm of 3^4 in the base 3 which is equal to 4 times logarithm of 3 in the base 3 which is equal to 4 times 1 as a logarithm of 3 in the base 3 is always equal to 1. Therefore the result of log of 81 in the base 3 is equal to 4. The logarithm of 100 in the base 10 is equal to logarithm of 10^2 in the base 10 as 100 is equal 10^2 which is equal to 2 times logarithm of 10 in the base 10 and logarithm of 10 in the base 10 is equal to 1, therefore the result is 2 times 1 which is equals to 2. Now let's try to find the logarithm of 1/81. This is equal to, logarithm of 1 over 3^4 in the base 3 which is equal to logarithm of 3 to the power of minus 4 in the base 3 which is equal to minus 4 times the logarithm of 3 in the base 3 and this is equal to 1. Then the result is equal to minus 4 times 1 which is equal to minus 4. Let's now try to work out the logarithm of 1 in the base 2. One is equal to 2^0 therefore the logarithm of 1 is equal to the logarithm of 2^0 which is equal to 0 times the logarithm of 2 in the base 2 and the logarithm of 2 in base 2 is equal to 1. Therefore the result is 0 times 1 which is equal to 0. Now let's try to plot a logarithmic function. Consider the following function f of x is equal to log of x in base 2. Now we will create a table of values of x and f of x and then sketch a graph of f. As you can see the function is increasing and it passes through the point of coordinates 1, 0. Let's now try to plot our logarithmic function with the base 2 and its inverse exponential function with the base 2. In this graph the blue curve represents the exponential function with base 2, and the green curve represents the logarithmic function with the base 2. As you can see these two curves are symmetric with respect to the red line y is equal to x. This is expected as the logarithmic function is just the inverse of the exponential function. This graph also shows the domain of the logarithmic function is the set of all positive real numbers. On the other hand its range is equal to the set of all real numbers. The logarithmic function intercept with the x-axis at point 1, 0. The graph also shows that the logarithmic function in this case is an increasing function as the base is greater than one. Now, let's look at an example in which the base is less than one. In this graph, the blue curve represents the exponential function with the base equal to half and the green curve represents the logarithmic function with the base equal to half. As you can see, these two curves are symmetric with respect to the red line y is equal to x. This is again is expected as the logarithmic function is just the inverse of the exponential function. Similarly, the domain of the logarithm in this case is equal to the set of all positive real numbers. On the other hand, each range is equal to the set of all real numbers. The logarithmic function intercepts with the x-axis at point 1, 0. The graph also shows that the logarithmic function is in this case a decreasing function as the base is strictly less than one. Now we will talk about a special logarithmic function called the natural logarithm. The natural logarithm function written as ln x, stands for natural logarithm of x is just the logarithmic function with the base equal to e where e has the value 2.71828. E is an irrational number, so it has a non-terminating decimal expression hence the natural logarithm of e is equal to 1. The graph of the natural logarithm of x given below shows that it is an increasing function as e is strictly greater than one. The graph also shows as it is expected that the natural logarithm of 1 is equal to 0 and the natural logarithm of e the base in this case is equal to 1. In this lecture we revisited exponential functions, introduce logarithmic functions, and discussed their relation to exponential functions. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 2.2 More about functions Video: Video Function composition .

Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key In this lecture we will cover two special functions which are used in computing. These functions are the floor functions and the ceiling function. The floor function is a function defined from R to Z. It takes as input a real number x, and gives us output a value which is the largest integer that is less than or equal to x. Denoted as floor of x, which is written using this type of square brackets. For example, given an integer n, if n is less than or equal to x, and x is strictly less than n plus 1, then the floor of x is equal to n. For example, 2.9 is between the integers 2 and 3. And 2.9 is strictly less than 3, hence the floor of 2.9 is equal to 2. And the floor of 3 is equal to 3, as 3 is the greatest integer less than or equal to 3. Similarly, if we have minus 2.5, which is a negative number which is between the integers minus 3 and minus 2, and minus 2.5 is strictly less than minus 2, hence, the floor of minus 2.5 is equal to minus 3. The floor of minus 3 is equal to minus 3, as minus 3 is the greatest integer less than or equal to minus 3. This graph shows the curve of the floor function. As you can see, the floor of any number x between 0 and 1, including 0, and excluding 1, is equal to 0. And the floor of any number x between 1 and 2, including 1, and excluding 2, is equal to 1. Similarly, the floor of any number x between minus 1 and 0, including minus 1, and excluding 0, is equal to minus 1. Now that we understand the meaning of the floor function, let's find the floor of the following numbers. The floor of any integer is equal to itself. Hence, the floor of 10 is equal to 10. 1.1 is between 1 and 2, and 1.1 is strictly less than 2. Hence, the floor of 1.1 is equal to 1. Similarly, 1.99 is between 1 and 2, and 1.99 is strictly less than 2. Hence, the floor of 1.99 is equal to 1. Now let's try a negative number. Minus 1.1 is between minus 2 and minus 1. And minus 1.1 is strictly less than minus 1. Hence, the floor of minus 1.1 is equal to minus 2. Similarly, 1.99 is between minus 2 and minus 1, and minus 1.99 is strictly less than minus 1. Hece, the floor of minus 1.99 is equal to minus 2. Now let's have a look at a different function, called the ceiling function. The ceiling function is a function defined from R to Z. It takes as input a real number x, and gives us output a value which is the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to x. Denoted as ceiling of x, which is written using this type of square brackets. For example, given an integer n, if n is strictly less than x, and x is less than or equal to n plus 1, then the ceiling of x is equal to n plus 1. For example, 2.9 is between the integers 2 and 3, and 2 is strictly less than 2.9. Hence, the ceiling of 2.9 is equal to 3. The ceiling of 3 is equal to 3, as 3 is the smallest integer greater than or equal to 3. Similarly, minus 2.5 is between the integers minus 3 and minus 2. And minus 3 is strictly less than minus 2.5. Hence, the ceiling of minus 2.5 is equal to minus 2. And the ceiling of minus 3 is equal to minus 3, as minus 3 is the smallest integer greater than or equal to minus 3. This graph shows the curve of the ceiling function. As you can see, the ceiling of any number x between minus 1 and 0, including 0, and excluding minus 1, is equal to 0. And the ceiling of any number x between 0 and 1, including 1, but excluding 0, is equal to 1. Similarly, the ceiling of any number x between minus 2 and minus 1, including minus 1, but excluding minus 2, is equal to minus 1. Now that we understand the meaning of the ceiling function, let's find the ceiling of the following numbers. The ceiling of any integer is equal to itself. Hence, the ceiling of 10 is equal to 10. 1.1 is between 1 and 2. And 1 is strictly less than 1.1. Hence, the ceiling of 1.1 is equal to 2. 1.99 is between 1 and 2, and 1 is strictly less than 1.99. Hence, the ceiling of 1.99 is equal to 2. Minus 1.1 is between minus 2 and minus 1. And minus 2 is strictly less than minus 1.1, hence the ceiling of minus 1.1 is equal to minus 1. Similarly, 1.99 is between minus 2 and minus 1, and minus 2 is strictly less than minus 1.99. Therefore, the ceiling of minus 1.99 is equal to minus 1. Now let's look an exercise using the floor function. Let n be an integer and x be a real number. We need to show that the floor of the expression x plus n is equal to the floor of x on its own plus n. You can now stop the video and have a go. Now let's prove this property. Let m be an integer, and assume that the floor of x is equal to m. By definition of the floor function we have m is less than or equal to x, and x is strictly less than m plus 1. And if we add n to both sides of this inequality, we have m plus n is less than or equal to x + n, which is strictly less than m plus n plus 1. This implies that the floor of the expression x plus n is equal to m plus n. This is by definition of the floor function. Finally, if we substitute m with the floor of x, we have the floor of the expression x plus n is equal to the floor of x on its own, plus the value n. This ends the proof. In this lecture we introduced two special functions, the floor functions, and the ceiling function. We then discussed some properties of these functions. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 2.2 More about functions Video: Video Function composition .

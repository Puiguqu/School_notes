You may contract your selection using shift + CTRL + arrow key. For screen readers that are incompatible with using arrow keys for shortcuts, you can replace them with the H J K L keys. Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key We will now do a couple of questions on your topic on functions. Question one, let A equal 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, B equals a, b, c, d and C equals w, x, y, z be three sets. Let f and g be two functions defined as follows. The function f maps set A to set B and is defined by the table there. For instance, if x is equal to one, f of x is equal to a. Function g maps set B to set C and is defined by the second table, where for instance, if x is equal to a, g of x is equal to w. You now must complete six questions: a, draw arrow diagrams to represent the functions f and g. List the domain, the co-domain, and the range of f and g. Find f of one, find the ancestor or pre-image of d, and find g of f of three. Show that f is not a one-to-one function, show that f is an onto function and finally, show that g is both one-to-one and onto. The first part is to draw arrow diagrams to represent the functions f and g. As we see, we have three blue circles. They represent the three sets A, B, and C. The first set of arrows represents function f, which maps set A comprising 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 to set B, which is a, b, c, d. For instance, we see that both one and three in set A are mapped by f to a in set B. Then f also maps two to b, it maps four to c and it maps both five and six to d. The second set of arrows represent function g. In this case, a is mapped to w, b is mapped to x, c is mapped to y, and d is mapped to z. The next question is to list the domain, the co-domain and the range of f and g. The domain of f, is just equal to the set of all the inputs. This is set A, which is equal to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The co-domain of f is equal to all its possible outputs. This is the set B, which is equal to a, b, c, d. The range of f is the set of all actual outputs. In this case, it is actually equal to the co-domain of f, also, which is a, b, c, d. Now what's the domain of g? This is the set of all inputs to function g, which is equal to the set B, which is equal to a, b, c, d. The co-domain of g is the set of all outputs. This is equal to c, and this is equal to w, x, y, z. The range of g is equal to the set of all actual outputs and again, we have in this case that the range of g is equal to w, x, y, z. But this isn't obviously true for all functions, just for this function. Now, let's find f of one. From the first table, we find that if x is equal to one, f of x is equal to a. So f of one is equal to a. Find the pre-image of d, that is the set of all elements in a that are mapped to d. We see from the first table that both five and six are mapped to d by f. So the pre-image of d is equal to the set 5, 6. Finally, let's find the composition g of f of three. From the first table, we see that f of three is equal to a. So the function f maps three to a. From the second table, we find that g of a is equal to w. So the function g maps a to w. So g of f of three is equal to g of a, which is equal to w. Now, let's show that f is not a one-to-one function. A one to one function would imply that if f of a is equal to f of b, then a is equal to b. However, we can see from the first table that f is not a one to one function as both f of five and f of six are equal to d. Two elements of a are mapped to the same element in set B. However, we can show that f is an onto function. The arrow diagram shows that every element in the co-domain has at least one pre-image. Hence the function f is and onto function. Finally, show that g is both one to one and onto. We can see from the arrow diagram that every element of the range of g has a unique pre-image. So g is a one to one function. The range of g is equal to the co-domain of g and so g is also an onto function. Hence, g is both one to one and onto. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 2.2 More about functions Video: Video Function composition .

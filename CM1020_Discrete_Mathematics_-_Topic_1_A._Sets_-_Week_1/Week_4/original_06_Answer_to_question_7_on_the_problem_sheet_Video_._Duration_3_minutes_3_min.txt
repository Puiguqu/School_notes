Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key we now come to the second exercise on functions given a function. F defined by F of X is equal to the floor of X, where f maps the set of real numbers to the set, vintages Plot The graph of the function f of X for X and the interval from minus 3 to 3. Use this graph to find the floor of pie the floor of minus 2.5 in the floor of minus one. Use the graph to show that F is not a 1 to 1 or injected function. Finally, is f onto or subjective. Justify your answer. So the first part of the question is to plot the graph of the function F FX for ex in the interval from minus 3 to 3. Remember that the floor function takes a real number and returns thean trigger the largest integer that is less than or equal to that number. This is shown in the graph there. Use this graph to find the floor of pie the floor of minus 2.5 on the floor of minus one. Now pie to two D. P is 3.14 so it's between the numbers three and four. So then the floor of pie, which is the largest integer that is less than or equal to pi, is equal to three. The floor of minus 2.5 is the largest integer that is less than or equal to minus 2.5, and this is minus three. This can be a little confusing because we're dealing with negative numbers. Finally, the floor of minus one, which is the largest indigent, less than or equal to minus one, is minus one. Use the graph to show that F is not a 1 to 1 or injected function. Now we see from the graph that each element of the range has more than one pre image. For instance, the floor of 2.5 is equal to the floor of 2.1, which is just equal to two. Therefore, the floor function is not a 1 to 1. Function finally, is f onto that is is it's subjective. Justify your answer for all n in the set, vintages. We can see that there exists at least one pre image X in the set of real numbers, such that the floor of X is equal to end. Therefore, every element of the CO domain has a pre image on the floor. Function is an on to function. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 2.2 More about functions Video: Video Function composition .

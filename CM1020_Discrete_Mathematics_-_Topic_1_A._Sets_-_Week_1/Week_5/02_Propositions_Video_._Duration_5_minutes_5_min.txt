Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

1. A proposition is a declarative sentence that can be either true or false but not both.
2. Propositions are the basic building blocks of logic and are used to construct reasoning and logical statements.
3. In mathematics, propositions are considered as the most fundamental elements of logic.
4. Examples of propositions include "London is the capital of United Kingdom" (true), "1 plus 1 equals 2" (true), and "2 is less than 3" (true).
5. Propositions can also be false, such as "Madrid is the capital of France".
6. A proposition can be considered true or false based on its content, regardless of how it is expressed in words.
7. Not all sentences are propositions; examples of non-propositions include "x plus 1 equals 2" (because x is unknown) and "what time is it?".
8. Propositions with variables, such as "p is a proposition", can be simplified using propositional variables like p, q, r, s.
9. Propositional variables are typically letters that represent propositions in mathematical notation.
10. The use of propositional variables simplifies notations and makes expressions more concise.
11. A true proposition asserts something that is indeed true, while a false proposition asserts something that is not true.
12. Propositions can be combined using logical operators to create compound propositions.
13. Compound propositions combine multiple propositions with logical operators such as conjunction (AND), disjunction (OR), and negation (NOT).
14. The truth value of a compound proposition depends on the truth values of its constituent propositions.
15. Understanding propositions is crucial in logic, mathematics, and other fields that rely on reasoning and argumentation.

Note: I condensed some details and omitted certain examples to fit within the 15-sentence limit while maintaining the essential information and technical details.

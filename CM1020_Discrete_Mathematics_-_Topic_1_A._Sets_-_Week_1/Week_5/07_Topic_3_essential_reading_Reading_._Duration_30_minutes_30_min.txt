Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

A comprehensive reading is recommended to consolidate knowledge on propositions, truth tables, and compound propositions. The reading covers the definition of a proposition, truth tables and truth sets, and compound propositions. Discrete Mathematics and its Applications by K.H. Rosen (2012) provides relevant pages for consolidation, specifically pp.1-6. Exercises from this book are also recommended, covering pp.12 exercises 1-4 and pp.13 exercises 5-9. Additionally, Koshy's work is suggested for further reading, with a focus on pages 2-9. Exercises from Koshy (2004) cover pp.17 exercises 3, 6, 9, 16, 19, 23, 25, and 31. Solutions to these exercises can be found in the book's "Solutions to Odd-Numbered Exercises" section. A total of 30 minutes are allocated for practice assignments on propositions, truth tables and truth sets, compound propositions, reading, and problem-solving. The recommended duration for each activity is as follows: propositions (30 min), truth tables and truth sets (30 min), compound propositions (30 min), reading (10 min), and problem-solving (10 min). A 2-minute video introduction to propositional logic is also available. There are two videos on propositions, one lasting 5 minutes and another covering compound propositions in 9 minutes. Two practice assignments are recommended for truth tables and truth sets, each lasting 30 minutes. The duration of the reading problem sheet and its solutions is 10 minutes each. A discussion prompt and video introduction to propositional logic are also provided.

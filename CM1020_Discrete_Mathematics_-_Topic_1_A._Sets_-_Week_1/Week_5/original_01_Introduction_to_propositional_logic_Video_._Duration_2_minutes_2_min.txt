I am an Associate Lecturer in Computer Science at Goldsmiths University of London. My research is in the field of Data Analytics. We will begin by defining propositional logic. Then, we will discuss the various properties of propositional logic, and finally, we will consider some possible applications of propositional logic. Propositional logic is a branch of logic that is interested in studying mathematical statements. It's the basis of all the reasoning and the rules that we use to construct mathematical theories. The original purpose of propositional logic dates back to Aristotle. It was originally used to model a reasoning. Propositional logic is effectively an algebra of propositions. In this algebra, the variables are unknown propositions instead of unknown real numbers. The operators used are: and, or, not, implies, and if and only if, rather than, plus, minus, multiply, and divide. Propositional logic can be used in computer circuit design. It can also be used in programming languages and systems, such as the language Prolog. Many systems for reasoning by computers, including theorem provers, program verifiers, and applications in the field of artificial intelligence, have been implemented in logic-based programming languages. These languages generally use predicate logic, more powerful form of logic that extends the capabilities of propositional logic. We will look at predicate logic in more detail in the next topic. In this short lecture, we briefly introduced propositional logic. We began by giving a definition of propositional logic, then we considered some possible applications of propositional logic. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Video: Video Introduction to propositional logic .

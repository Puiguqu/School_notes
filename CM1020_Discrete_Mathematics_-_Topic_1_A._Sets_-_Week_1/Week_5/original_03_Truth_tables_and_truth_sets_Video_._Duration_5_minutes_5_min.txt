Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key In this lecture, we will discuss the concepts of truth tables and truth sets. We will start by defining what truth table is. Then we will show how we can build a truth table, and look at an example of how it works. Finally, we will define a truth set, and look at some examples of the truth set of some compound propositions. In the previous lecture, we were able to assess the truth value of simple propositions. However, as we begin to build more complex propositions, we need a methodology for keeping track of this proposition's truth values. We can use truth tables for this purpose. A truth table is a tabular representation of all the possible combinations of its constituents propositional variables. For instance, let's consider the case of two propositional variables p and q. The truth table in this case includes four rows representing the whole range of possible combinations of p and q. Those combinations are false false, and false true, and true false, and finally, true true. Now, let us look at how we can go about constructing a truth table. Consider the case of n propositional variables for which we want to build a truth table. We begin by creating a table with 2_n rows, and n columns. Then we fill the n columns with all the possible combinations usually beginning with false values. Now let's see how this works using an example of three propositional variables; p, q, and r. The table, will contain eight rows. In the column representing the p truth values will alternate four false values, followed by four true values. In the column representing the q truth values will alternate two false values, followed by two true values. In the column representing the r truth values will alternate one false value followed by one true value. This way, we have build the set of all possibilities of the triplet p, q, and r. Let's move on to define a truth set. Let p be a proposition on a set S. The truth sets of p is the set of elements of S for which p is true. We usually use a capital letter to refer to truth set of a proposition. For instance, the truth set of a proposition p is noted as capital P. Let's take a look at how truth sets work in practice. Let S be the set of integers from 1-10, and let p and q be two propositions concerning an integer n in the set S, defined as follows: p is the proposition and is even, q is the proposition and is odd. The truth set of P written as capital P is the set containing 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10, and the truth set of q is the set capital Q, containing 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9. In this lesson, we introduced the concepts of truth tables and truth sets of proposition. We begun by defining a truth table, and looking at how to build the truth table of a proposition, and finally, we discussed the concepts of truth sets of proposition. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Video: Video Introduction to propositional logic .

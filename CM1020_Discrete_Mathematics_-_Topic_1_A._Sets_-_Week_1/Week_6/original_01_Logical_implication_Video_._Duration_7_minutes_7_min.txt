Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key In this lecture, we will talk about logical implication. We will begin by defining an implication or conditional statements, then we will build its truth table, and finally we will discuss the converse, inverse, and contrapositive of an implication. So let's start by defining implication. Let p and q be propositions. The conditional statement or implication p implies q is the proposition if p then q, where p is called the hypothesis, and q is called the conclusion or consequence. Now, let's take look at an example of implication. Let p and q be the following statements: p is ''John did well in discrete mathematics'' q is ''John will do well in the programming course'' The conditional statement p implies q can be written as follows: ''If John did well in discrete mathematics then John will do well in the programming course'' Now, we are going to have a look at the truth table for a conditional statement. The logical condition can be viewed as the reasoning from p to q. For instance, if our reasoning is correct, which is represented by true implication, then if the hypothesis is true, the conclusion is also true. But if the reasoning is incorrect, which is represented by false implication, then if the hypothesis is true, then the conclusion is false. The truth table also shows us that it's true to think that if the hypothesis is false, then any conclusion can be implied whether it's false or true. We can express conditional statements in multiple ways. For example, let p and q be the following statements, p is the proposition, ''It's sunny'', q is the proposition ''John goes to the park. '' The implication p implies q can be expressed in the following ways: If p then q, if p, q, p implies q, p only if q, q follows from p, p is sufficient for q, q unless not p, q is necessary for p. All of those expressions hold the same meaning which is, ''If it's sunny, then John goes to the park.'' Let's also note that the statement q is necessary for p might be counter-intuitive in English, because it suggests that John's going into the park is the requirement for sunny day. The best way to understand it, is to implicitly read it as, ''John's going to the park is a necessary consequence of a sunny day.'' Now, let's move on to examine the meaning of converse, inverse, and contrapositive. Let p and q be propositions, and A the conditional statement, p implies q. Starting with the statement p implies q, we can form some new conditional statements. We will examine three important statements: The proposition q implies p is the converse of A, proposition not q implies not p is the contrapositive of A, and the proposition not p implies not q is the inverse of A, later we will examine how these three propositions are related to the original one. Let's take look at an example that illustrates these three propositions: Let p and q be the following statements: p ''It's sunny'', q ''John goes to the park'', and A the statement p implies q, which means, ''If it's sunny, then John goes to the park.'' The converse of A is, ''If John goes to the park then it's sunny.'' The contrapositive of A is, ''If John doesn't go to the park, then it's not sunny'', and the inverse of A is ''If it's not sunny, then John doesn't go to the park.'' Let's take a look at another example. Let p and q be true propositions concerning a given integer n, p is n has one digit, q is n is less than 10. Let's begin by writing the following statements using symbolic logic expression. ''If the integer n has one digit, then it is less than 10.'' The statements can be written simply as p implies q. Now, let's write it's contrapositive using both symbolic logic, and English. In symbolic logic expression, this statement can be written as, not q implies not p. In English, it can be expressed as, ''If n is greater than or equal to 10, then n has more than one digit.'' In this lecture we have talked about another type of logical operation, logical implication. We begun by defining an implication or conditional statements, then we build and examined its truth table, and finally, we looked at the converse contrapositive and inverse of an implication. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 3.2 Applications Discussion Prompt: Propositions and computer logic .

Logical implication is a fundamental concept in propositional logic. The implication p→q (read as "if p, then q") is a compound statement that is false only when p is true and q is false; otherwise, it is true. Truth table The truth table for p→q is as follows: p T T F F q T F T F p→q T F T T Explanation – When p is true and q is true, the implication p→q is true. – When p is true and q is false, the implication p→q is false. – When p is false, the implication p→q is true regardless of the truth value of q. Examples Consider the following propositions: p “It is raining." q“It is wet." The implication p→q can be read as "If it is raining, then the ground is wet." This implication would be evaluated as: If it is indeed raining and the ground is wet, the statement p→q is true. If it is raining and the ground is not wet, the statement p→q is false. If it is not raining, the statement p→q is true regardless of whether the ground is wet or not. Lesson 3.2 Applications Discussion Prompt: Propositions and computer logic .

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Predicate logic is a type of logic that overcomes the limitations of propositional logic. It can express complex reasoning and formalize statements with unknown truth values. The two statements "All men are mortal" and "Socrates is a man" cannot be represented by propositional logic alone. However, they can be expressed using predicate logic to build more complex reasoning. For example, if we consider the statement "X squared is equal to 4," it is not a proposition but rather an equation whose truth value depends on X. This type of statement cannot be expressed using propositional logic alone. Predicate logic is able to handle these types of statements and provide a powerful tool for formalizing complex reasoning.

Predicate logic is defined by its use of predicates, which are functions that assign properties to entities. For example, the predicate "is mortal" can be used to assign a property to Socrates in the statement "Socrates is a man." The key properties of predicate logic include:

*   Quantification: the ability to express statements with unknown truth values
*   Nested quantifiers: the use of multiple quantifiers to describe complex relationships between entities
*   Predicates: functions that assign properties to entities

Predicate logic provides a powerful tool for formalizing complex reasoning and expressing statements with unknown truth values. It can be used to build more complex models of reality, including those involving abstract objects and mathematical concepts.

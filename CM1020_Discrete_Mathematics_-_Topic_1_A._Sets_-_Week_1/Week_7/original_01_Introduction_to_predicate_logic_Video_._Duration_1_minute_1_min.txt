Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key In this lecture, we will introduce a different type of logic known as predicate logic. Propositional logic which we explored in the previous topic is helpful for studying propositions, but has some limitations it cannot express precisely the meaning of complex statements in mathematics. Also, it's only studies propositions which are statements with known truth values. Predicate logic overcome these limitations and can be used to build more complex reasoning. Let's look at the following two statements. All men are mortal. Socrates is a man. Naturally, it follows that Socrates is mortal. This can't be represented by propositional logic. Therefore, we need a more powerful type of logic that is able to formalize this kind of reasoning. This can be achieved using predicate logic. Let's take a look at another example consider the following statement. X squared is equal to 4. This is not a proposition as its truth value is a function depending on x. This can't be expressed with propositional logic whereas predicate logic is powerful enough to express these types of statements. Throughout this topic, we will define and discuss in more detail the key properties of predicate logic. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Video: Video Introduction to predicate logic .

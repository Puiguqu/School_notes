Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving all key information, formulae, and technical details:

1. Rules of inference are fundamental logical principles that outline valid ways to derive conclusions from premises.
2. They serve as building blocks of logical reasoning, enabling construction of valid arguments and proofs.
3. Modus Ponens states that if P→Q and P are both true, then Q is true: P→Q P −−−− ∴Q.
4. Modus Tollens states that if P→Q and ¬Q are both true, then ¬P is true: P→Q ¬Q −−−− ∴¬P.
5. Hypothetical Syllogism states that if P→Q and Q→R are both true, then P→R is true: P→Q Q→R −−−− ∴P→R.
6. Disjunctive Syllogism states that if P∨Q and ¬P are both true, then Q is true: P∨Q ¬P −−−− ∴Q.
7. Conjunction states that if P and Q are both true, then P∧Q is true: P Q −−−− ∴P∧Q.
8. Simplification states that if P∧Q is true, then P is true: P∧Q −−−− ∴P.
9. Addition states that if P is true, then P∨Q is true: P −−−− ∴P∨Q.
10. Existential Instantiation states that if ∃xP(x) is true, then P(c) is true for some particular c: ∃xP(x) −−−− ∴P(c).
11. Universal Generalisation states that if P(c) is true for any arbitrary c, then ∀xP(x) is true: P(c) for any arbitrary c −−−−−−− −−−∴ ∀xP(x).
12. Existential Generalisation states that if P(c) is true for some particular c, then ∃xP(x)is true: P(c) for some particular c −−−−−−− −−−∴∃xP(x).
13. Rules of inference are used to prove statements in practice through examples.
14. Example 1 demonstrates the use of Modus Ponens to prove Q is true given P∨Q and ¬P.
15. Example 2 demonstrates the use of Universal Generalisation to prove R(a)∧S(a) is true, given ∀x(P(x)→R(x)) and ∀x(Q(x)→S(x)), with premises P(a) and Q(a).

Unfortunately, the text provided does not contain any specific information about mathematical concepts or formulas. It appears to be a list of resources for learning and practicing various topics in logic, including De Morgan's laws, rules of inference, and rules of inference with quantifiers.

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences:

There are several pages assigned to read from Rosen (2012) that cover De Morgan's laws, rules of inference, and rules of inference with quantifiers. The readings also include exercises for practice and review. In addition, exercises from Koshy and Levin are recommended for completion.

Koshy provides information on pp. 43-44. Levin provides additional resources on pp. 6, 202-203, and 205-209.

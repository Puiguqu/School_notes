Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key In this lecture, we will talk about rules of inference with quantifiers. We will begin by introducing the concepts of rules of inference with quantifiers, then we will discuss in more detail some of the widely used rules of inference with quantifiers. Finally, we will explain how to express complex statements using quantifiers. In the previous lecture, we introduced rules of inference for propositions. Now we will describe some important rules of inference for statements involving quantifiers. These rules of inference either remove or reintroduce quantifiers within a statement. The first rule of inference is called universal instantiation. This rule of inference is used to conclude that P of c is true where c is a particular member of the domain given the premise for all x P of x. For instance, if all computer science students study discrete mathematics then John who is a computer science student studies discrete mathematics. As we can see, this inference rule removes the universal quantifier. The second rule of inference is called universal generalization. This rule is used to conclude that for all x P of x is true by taking an arbitrary element C from the domain and showing that P of c is true. For example, let DS be the domain of all data science students. Let c be an arbitrary element in DS. If c studies machine learning we can conclude that for all x, that is an element of DS, x studies machine learning given that the premise P of c is true for any arbitrary elements c in the domain. As we can see, this inference rule introduces a universal quantifier. The existential instantiation rule of inference is used to conclude that there is an element c in the domain for which P of c is true. If we know that there is x P of x is true. We cannot select an arbitrary value of x here but rather acknowledge that it exists. Let's name it c and use it in our algorithms. For instance, let DS be the domain of all data science students given the premise there exists a student of Data Science who uses Python Pandas library. We can conclude that the students c exists and is using, Python Pandas library. As we can see this inference rule removes the existential quantifier. The existential generalization rule of inference is used to conclude that there exists x P of x is true when P of c is true for some elements c of the domain. For instance, let DS be the domain of all data science students given the premise that John who is a student of Data Science got an A in Machine Learning course. We can conclude that there exists someone in Data Science who got an A in machine learning. As we can see this inference rule introduces the existential quantifier. The universal modus ponens rule of inference can be seen as a combination of universal instantiation and modus ponens. It is used to conclude that if for all x in the domain, P of x implies Q of x and if P of a is true for some elements of the domain, we can conclude that Q of a is also true. For instance, let DS be the domain of all computer science students. Given the premise that every computer science student studying data science will study machine learning and given the premise that John is a computer science student studying data science, we can conclude that John will study machine learning. The universal modus tollens rule of inference can be seen as a combination of universal instantiation and modus tollens. It is used to conclude that if for all x in the domain, P of x implies Q of x and if Q of a is false for some element of the domain, we can conclude that P of a is also false. For instance, let CS be the domain of all computer science students. Given the premise that every computer science student studying data science will study machine learning and given the premise that John is not studying machine learning, we can conclude that John is not studying data science. Given a statement in natural language, we can formalize it using the following steps as appropriate. First, determine the universe of discourse of variables. Then reformulate the statements by making for all and there exists explicit. Reformulate the statement by introducing variables and defining predicates. Finally, reformulate the statement by introducing quantifiers and logical operations. Let's have a go at formalizing the statement S, there exists a real number between any two, not equal real numbers. The universe of discourse can be defined as the set of all real numbers. S can then be rewritten using variables and predicates as, for all real numbers x and y, there exists a z between x and y. Finally, we can reformulate S using quantifiers and logical operators as follows. For all x, for all y, if x is less than y, then there exists z where z is between x and y. In this second example let's express the statement as, every student has taken a course in machine learning. The expression will depend on the choice of the universe of discourse. In the first case, let the universe of discourse be, all students. Let M of x be the predicate, x has taken a course in machine learning. The statement S can be expressed as for all x, M of x. In the second case, let the universe of discourse be, all people and let S of x be the predicate, x is a student and M of x the same predicate as in Case 1. S can be expressed as, for all x, S of x implies M of x. Note that it is not correct to represent the statement as, x, S of x, and M of x. In this third example let's express the statement, some student has taken a course in machine learning. Again, the expression will depend on the choice of the universe of discourse. In the first case, let the universe of discourse be all students. Let M of x be the predicate x has taken a course in machine learning. The statement S can be expressed as there exists x, M of x. In the second case, let the universe of discourse be all people. Let S of x be the predicate x is a student and M of x the same predicate as in Case 1. S can be expressed as there exists x, S of x, and M of x. We note that it is not correct to represent the statement as, there exists x where S of x implies M of x. In this lecture, we looked at the rules of inference with quantifiers. We began by introducing the concept of rules of inference with quantifiers. Then we examined some of the widely used rules of inference with quantifiers in more detail. Finally, we explained how to express complex statements using quantifiers. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 4.2 Applications Video: Video De Morgan's laws for quantifiers .

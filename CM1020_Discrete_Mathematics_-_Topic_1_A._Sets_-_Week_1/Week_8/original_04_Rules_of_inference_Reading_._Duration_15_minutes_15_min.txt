Rules of inference are fundamental logical principles that outline the valid ways to derive conclusions from premises. They serve as the building blocks of logical reasoning, enabling the construction of valid arguments and proofs. Here is a summary of rules of inference we have seen in this topic. 1. Modus Ponens If P→Q and P are both true, then Q is true. P→Q P −−−− ∴Q 2. Modus Tollens If P→Q and ¬Q are both true, then ¬P is true. P→Q ¬Q −−−− ∴¬P 3. Hypothetical Syllogism If P→Q and Q→R are both true, then P→R is true. P→Q Q→R −−−− ∴P→R 4. Disjunctive Syllogism If P∨Q and ¬P are both true, then Q is true. P∨Q ¬P −−−− ∴Q 5. Conjunction If P and Q are both true, then P∧Q is true. P Q −−−− ∴P∧Q 6. Simplification If P∧Q is true, then P is true. P∧Q −−−− ∴P 7. Addition If P is true, then P∨Q is true. P −−−− ∴P∨Q 8. Existential Instantiation If ∃xP(x) is true, then P(c) is true for some particular c. ∃xP(x) −−−− ∴P(c) 9. Universal Generalisation If P(c) is true for any arbitrary c, then ∀xP(x) is true. P(c) for any arbitrary c −−−−−−− −−−− ∴∀xP(x) 10. Existential Generalisation If P(c) is true for some particular c, then ∃xP(x)is true. P(c) for some particular c −−−−−−− −−−− ∴∃xP(x) Let's try and see how rules of inference work in practice through the following two examples. Example 1 Given: 1. 2. P∨Q ¬P We need to to prove that $ Q $ is true. Solution: 1. 2. 3. P∨Q(Premise) ¬P(Premise) Q −−−−−−−−−−− ∴Q Example 2 Given: 1. 2. 3. 4. ∀x(P(x)→R(x)) ∀x(Q(x)→S(x)) P(a) Q(a) We need to prove: R(a)∧S(a) is true. Solution: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. ∀x(P(x)→R(x)) ∀x(Q(x)→S(x)) P(a)(Premise) Q(a)(Premise) P(a)→R(a) Q(a)→S(a) R(a) S(a) R(a)∧S(a) −−−−−−−−−−− ∴R(a)∧S(a) Lesson 4.2 Applications Video: Video De Morgan's laws for quantifiers .

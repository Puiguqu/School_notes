Boolean algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with logical operations. The six axioms of Boolean algebra, known as Huntington's postulates, are: closure, identity, commutativity, complements, distributivity, and uniqueness of complements. These axioms define the properties of Boolean operations such as AND (dot) and OR (plus). The Boolean operation satisfies the following laws: idempotent law (x + x = x and x.x = x), tautology (x + 1 is always true), contradiction (x * 0 is always false), involution (x complemented twice equals x), associative law (x + y + z = x + y + z), absorption law (x + xy = x and x.x + y = x), and uniqueness of complements. De Morgan's theorems state that the complement of a product is equal to the sum of the complements, and the complement of a sum is equal to the product of the complements. The principle of duality states that every theorem in Boolean algebra remains valid if we interchange all ANDs and ORs and interchange all zeros and ones. There are four ways to prove the equivalence of Boolean relations: perfect induction (showing identical truth tables), axiomatic proof (applying Huntington's postulates or other rules), duality principle, and contradiction. The absorption rule can be proved by writing a true table or using the rules earlier seen as x + xy = x and x.x + y = x. Boolean algebra has many applications in digital electronics and computer science, including circuit design and analysis. Understanding Boolean algebra is essential for designing and analyzing digital circuits, which are used in computers, communication systems, and other electronic devices.

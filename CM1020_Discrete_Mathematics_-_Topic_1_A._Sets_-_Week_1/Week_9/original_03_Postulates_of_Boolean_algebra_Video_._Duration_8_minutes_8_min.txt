Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key In this lesson, we will introduce the basic rules of Boolean algebra. We first discuss the six axioms of Huntington's postulates, we then introduce and discuss some basic theorems that can be deduced from these six axioms such as De Morgan's theorem and principle of duality. Finally, we will discuss ways of proving theorems. Huntington defined six axioms that must be satisfied by any Boolean algebra. These axioms known as Huntington's postulates are follows. Closure, the value of any Boolean operation is either zero or one. Identity, the value of x plus 0 and x.1 is always equal to the value of x. Commutativity. Plus and dot are both commutative. That is, x plus y equals y plus x and x.y equals y.x. Complements. The logical sum of x and it's corresponding complement is always equal to one where the logical products of x and its corresponding complement is always equal to zero. Distance elements, any Boolean algebra has to have two distinct values. Using the six axioms of Boolean algebra that we just looked at, we can deduce other rules that are useful for analyzing and designing circuits. Idempotent laws. For any logical variable x we have, x plus x equals x and x.x equals x. Tautology and contradiction. For any logical variable x, x plus 1 is a tautology as its value is always equal to one whereas, x.0 is a contradiction as its value is always equal to 0. Involution. For any logical variable x, the value of applying the complement twice on x is always equal to x. Associative laws. Given any three logical variables x, y, and z, we have x plus y plus z equals x plus y plus z, and x.y.z equals x.y.z. Absorption laws. Given any two logical variables x and y, we have x plus x.y equals x, and x.x plus y equals x. Uniqueness of complements. Given any two logical variables, x and y. If y plus x equals 1 and y.x equals 0, then x equals complements of y. Inversion law. The complement of zero is equal to one and the complement of one is equal to zero. Now, let's have a look at De Morgan's theorems. The first of De Morgan's theorems states that the compliments of a product of variables is equal to the sum of the compliments of the variables. The complements of x.y equals the complements of x plus the complements of y. By building the true table, we can see that the two expressions have identical truth values. The second of De Morgan's laws states that the compliments of a sum of variables is equal to the products of the complements of the variables. By building the truth tables, we can see that the two expressions have identical to root values. Now, let's use two tables to show the distributivity of plus over dots. By building the two tables, we can see that the two expressions in the final two columns have identical truth values. Therefore, we can say that plus is distributive over dots. If we begin with the Boolean relation, we can then build another equivalent Boolean relation by, first, changing every OR operator to an AND operator and changing every AND operator to an OR operator, and then changing all zeros to ones and all ones to zeros. For example, let's consider the following expression which follows from the distributive law that we saw earlier. A plus BC equals A plus B multiplied by A plus C. By changing plus two dots and dots two plus, we can build another relation using the duality principle. A multiplied by B plus C equals AB plus AC. Let's consider the following two Boolean equations. The dual equations of e1 and e2 are obtained by interchanging plus and dot and interchanging zero and one as follows. In general, there are four ways by which we can prove the equivalence of Boolean relations. Perfect induction, by showing that the two expressions have identical truth tables. Axiomatic proof, by applying Huntington's postulates or any of the rules or theories that we have seen so far. Duality principle, every theorem in Boolean algebra remains valid if we interchange all ANDs and ORs and interchange all zeros and ones. By contradiction, by assuming that the hypothesis is false and then showing that this leads to a false conclusion. Now, let's try to prove the absorption rule. The absorption rule can easily be proved by writing a true table as follows. It can also be proved directly using the rules that we saw earlier as follows and starting from x plus x.y equals x. If we apply the duality principle, we can also deduce that x.x plus y equals x. In this lecture, we looked at the basic rules of Boolean algebra. We began by introducing the six axioms of a Huntington's postulates then we looked at some basic theorems that can be deduced from these six axioms such as De Morgan's laws and the principle of duality. Finally, we considered different ways of proving the equivalence of different expressions. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Video: Video Midterm preparation .

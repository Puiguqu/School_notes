Boolean algebra is a mathematical structure that captures the essentials of logic operations and set operations. It is foundational to the design and analysis of digital circuits and computer algorithms. Here are the primary postulates, or axioms, of Boolean algebra: Fundamental postulates: Closure with respect to binary operations The value of any Boolean operation belong the set {0,1}. We say the set S={0,1} is closed under the operations of addition (OR, +). and multiplication (AND, .).This means that for all a,b∈S, a+b∈S and a.b∈S. Identity For all a∈S we have a+0=a and a.1=a. Complement: Every element a∈S has a complement a’∈S For every a∈S: a+a’=1 and a.a’=0. Commutativity: The operations of addition and multiplication are commutative. For all a,b∈S: a+b=b+a and a,b=b.a. Associativity: The operations of addition and multiplication are associative. For all a,b,c∈S: (a+b)+c=a+(b+c) and (a.b).c=a.(b.c) Distributivity: The operations of addition and multiplication are distributive over each other. For all a,b,c∈S: a.(b+c)=a.b+a.c and a+(b+c)=(a+b)+c Additional Postulates Absorption: For all a,b ∈ S: a+(a.b)=a and a.(a+b)b=a. Idempotent law: For all a \in$$ S: a+a=a and a.a=a De Morgan’s laws: For all a,b∈S: (a+b)’=a’.b’ and (a.b)’=a’+b’ The postulates of Boolean algebra provide a formal framework to manipulate and reason about logical expressions and digital circuits using addition (+) for OR and multiplication (⋅) for AND. These principles are foundational to computer science, digital logic design, and various fields involving binary decision processes. Video: Video Midterm preparation .

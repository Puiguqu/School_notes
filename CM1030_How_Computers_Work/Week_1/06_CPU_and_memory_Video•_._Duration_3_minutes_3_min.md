Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

A notional machine is a simplified model used to understand specific applications or software. It can be useful for beginners, as it provides a basic understanding of how computers work. The most important component of a computer is the central processing unit (CPU), which performs calculations and runs instructions that make up code. The CPU is the core of the computer, responsible for executing instructions. Another vital component is random access memory (RAM), where data is stored while being processed by the CPU. Data is sent from RAM to the CPU, processed, and then written back to RAM. This interaction between the CPU and RAM is a fundamental aspect of how computers work. When editing a document in a word processor, most of the data remains in RAM, with only specific parts loaded into the CPU for processing. The CPU performs tasks such as adding or deleting characters, which are then written back to the document in memory. Other devices like screens, keyboards, hard disks, sound cards, and speakers also play crucial roles in a computer's functioning. When starting a new song on an audio player, data is loaded from the hard disk into RAM, processed by the CPU (if necessary), and sent to the sound card for playback. Modern computers often feature direct memory access, which bypasses the CPU and directly copies data from memory to the sound card, freeing up the CPU for other tasks. This simplification allows us to understand complex processes in a more manageable way. Notional machines are useful because they provide a basic understanding of how real computers work, despite being simplified models.

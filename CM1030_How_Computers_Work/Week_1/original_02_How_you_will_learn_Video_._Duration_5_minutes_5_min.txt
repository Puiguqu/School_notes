Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key This course is about teaching some of the fundamental knowledge you'll need as a computer scientist. It concerns the basics of how modern computer systems work. In some ways that means there's a lot of facts to learn. This course is also about being able to put that knowledge into practice. The most obvious way you'll learn is through videos like this one. Some of the videos will teach the core concepts, but I generally try to also include videos that illustrate the concepts with examples. Whether that means me explaining the example or an interview with an expert. As well as the videos you'll have access to a textbook with readings that will deepen your knowledge. The textbook readings are core parts of the course. See you'll miss important aspects if you just watch the videos without reading the book. But just passively watching and reading are not enough. Everything we know about the science of the brain tells us that we don't learn well passively. We need to practice what we learn. For knowledge, that practice can mean testing yourself. Do you know how a particular network protocol works for example? In this course you can practice by doing quizzes. There were a lot of quizzes in this course, some of them count towards your final mark, but most of them are practice quizzes which are there to help you learn. These practice quizzes are a core part of the learning in the course and they're just as important if not more so than the videos. Make sure you do all of them. If you do you'll be well prepared to succeed in this course. How computers work isn't just about facts and factual knowledge, it's about applying that knowledge in practice. Some of the quiz questions will ask you to apply your knowledge to new areas, but the main way you'll practice applying knowledge is through discussions and peer review exercises. They will both ask you to explain how computer systems work in terms of the concepts you're learning. That computer system could be an application, a file format, or a website. In discussions, you'll work with other students to understand particular computer systems that you have chosen. Peer reviews are exercises where you watch and answer the question and you get feedback from other students. They're a really good way to get some early feedback on your work, but you don't just learn by receiving feedback, you learn by giving feedback By seeing other students work and judging what is good and bad about it, you're learning one of the most important skills you can learn in your degree, how to evaluate your work and the work of others. When you go out and work in the real world, you generally don't have people marking your work. It will really be down to you to recognize how good your work is and how you can make it better. So it's really important even early in your degree to start learning how to evaluate your work. This is the scale that pair review activities will teach you. When you mark other student's work, you'll use exactly the same mark scheme that we'll use when marking your work. So you have a chance to get to know what we're looking for in your work and how we judge it. Ideally, by the time you get your mark, you should be able to protect your mark very well. But I should warn you, in our experience, students tend to mark more generously than tutors. So you might get marks that are whole grade boundary higher from your peers than you would from us. So, even if you're getting good marks, you should still think about what you could be doing better. When looking at the rubric, you should remember that general grading scheme on this degree. The pass mark is 40 percent, marks between 50 and 70 count as T2 or T1 grades which are good grades that my students will get. If you successfully answer the questions as we expect you to, you should be getting grades in the 60 to 70 percent range, which is a T1. Grades over 70 percent correspond to a first-class degree, and they're required to go beyond what's taught in class. For Marks in the 70s, this might mean doing some independent research. For Marks in the 90s, this means going far beyond what we'd expect at the start of an undergraduate degree. Marks above 90 percent are very rare. So, when you're marking peer review work, remember that you should expect most grades to be in the mid-range, and very high grades to be rare. When you get your marks, don't worry if you don't get very high grades, mid-range grades still mean that you're doing very well. This course has two main assessments: a coursework at the middle of the course, and the final exam. The coursework is worth 50 percent of your mark, and includes the tests that you do every week, and the exam is the remaining 50 percent. The course will prepare you for your assessment, there should be no surprises or tricks. In particular, the types of questions you'll be asked in the coursework in the exam will be the same type of questions you'll be doing in your practice activities. There will be multiple choice questions that are similar to the quizzes and long answer questions that are similar for peer review exercises. So, if you do all the exercises every week, you should be well prepared for the exam and coursework. Remember that the quizzes, peer reviews, and discussions are the core part of the learning not optional extras. If you do them, you will be ready to do well at the exam and coursework. But if you do not do them, you are unlikely to have learned everything you need. So, you're ready to start learning how computers work. I hope you enjoy and learn a lot from all the activities I've prepared for you. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 1.0 Introduction Video: Video What is computer science and how can it help us? .

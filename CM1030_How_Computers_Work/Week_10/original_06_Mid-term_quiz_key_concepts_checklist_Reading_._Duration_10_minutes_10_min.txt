Overview This study guide outlines the essential skills, concepts, and knowledge required to successfully complete the 'How Computers Work' mid-term exam. The exam assesses a range of topics, from basic computer operations to more advanced concepts like encryption, dynamic libraries and memory management. Key concepts and skills Encryption Understand what encryption is and its purpose. Recognise that encryption prevents unauthorised access to private files by converting data into a coded format. Dynamic libraries Know what a dynamic library is and how it differs from other components like executables, resources and user files. Understand that dynamic libraries contain code used by applications but are not part of the main executable. Memory addresses Define a memory address and understand its purpose in identifying a specific cell in memory. Peripheral devices and system bus Know which hardware component connects peripheral devices (e.g., keyboards, mice) to the system bus. Understand the role of device controllers in this context. Domain names and IP addresses Identify what a domain name is and differentiate it from an IP address, email address, and hexadecimal numbers. Understand the role of domain names in the context of web addresses. Utilities Define what a utility is in the context of computer software. Recognise that utilities are small software programs designed for specific tasks like disk formatting. MEMLOAD instruction Comprehend what the MEMLOAD instruction does in terms of data transfer between main memory and registers. Computer security Understand why certain types of malware might fail due to restrictions on background processes, privileged instructions and administrator access. File size comparisons Compare the file size of images to text, understanding the approximate number of words an uncompressed image can represent. Data compression techniques Understand the concept of run-length encoding and identify types of images that can be easily compressed using this method.

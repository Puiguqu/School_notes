Unfortunately, the provided text does not contain any technical details or key information about a specific topic. It appears to be a transcript of a lecture or video discussing peer review activities in a course, specifically exam preparation.

However, I can provide a summary of the main points:

* The course will feature both peer review activities and multiple-choice questions.
* Peer review activities are an important part of the learning process for the course and will also appear on the exam.
* The exam will test knowledge of the course material, including factual questions.
* Practicing these types of questions is recommended to prepare for the exam.
* The peer review exercise this week aims to help students practice answering exam-style questions.
* Students should try to answer the questions without looking at notes or other resources to test their recall.
* Reviewing the answers after attempting them can help ensure accuracy.

There are no specific formulas, technical details, or key findings in this text. If you could provide more context or information about the topic being discussed, I would be happy to try and assist further.

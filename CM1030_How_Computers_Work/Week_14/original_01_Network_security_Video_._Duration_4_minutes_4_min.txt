Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key We mentioned earlier on in this course that networks weighs a lot of security issues that need to be dealt with. One of the most important is that packets are sent across many unknown and possibly malicious computers that couldn't intercept them. One solution to this is to use a network protocol like HTTPS. HTTPS is an encrypted version of the HTTP protocol. Since it is an application layer protocol, the application layer packet is encrypted using the types of encryption algorithm we looked at in topic two. This encrypted packet is wrapped in a transport network and link layer packets and sent over the network. When it reaches a router, that router can extract and use the unencrypted network packets but cannot see inside the encrypted HTTPS packet that it contains. Only when the packet reaches its final destination is the HTTPS packets sent to the browser which has the correct decryption key to read the contents of the packet. Network security isn't all about defending your packets from the network. In fact, network administrators spend a lot of time defending their networks from external attacks, computers that attempt to disable the whole network or computers on it. One possible attack that an external machine can do is a hack. Trying to get access to another machine without being allowed to do so. This can normally be avoided using authentication, making sure all users login with a secure password. But there are also attacks that can disable a network without gaining access to any machines. A common example is distributed denial of service attack. This involves a lot of computers simultaneously sending huge amounts of network packets to a specific machine or to lots of machines on the network. They send so many packets that the network or computers completely overloaded and cannot handle it's normal business. Distributed denial service is often performed using botnets, a network of computers that have been infected by a virus which makes them perform the attack. Distributed denial of service is difficult attack to defend against because it's done using valid network packets rather than a hack which can be stopped using authentication or virus code that can be scanned for. The attack looks like normal network traffic, so it can be hard to spot. The most common approach is to use a firewall which is a filter that prevents certain types of packets from coming in and out of a machine or a network. That might mean only allowing certain approved protocols or rejecting packets from IP addresses that can be known to be malicious called blacklisting or even whitelisting which means only allowing packets that come from a list of approved good IP addresses. Unfortunately, firewalls can often accidentally block legitimate traffic which can annoy users. Firewalls are often implemented together with proxy servers. A proxy server is a computer that acts as an intermediary between a client and a server or between a client and computers on a network. All traffic must go through the proxy server which then forwards packets to the appropriate computers. That means that no external computers can directly interact with computers in a network and all traffic can be filtered with the firewall. If configured correctly, proxy servers and firewalls are good defenses against a wide range of security threats. But there were many other valuable security techniques that you can find out about in the reading later in this lesson. New security threats are being invented every day so network administrators need to be constantly vigilant and keep their defenses up to date, which is something that you will also need to take account of in your career as a computer scientist. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 14.1 Network security Discussion Prompt: How can malware compromise a network? .

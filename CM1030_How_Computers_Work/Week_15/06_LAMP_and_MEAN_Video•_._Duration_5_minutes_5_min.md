There is no text to summarize. The provided input appears to be a course structure or lesson outline for an online course, listing topics, video durations, reading times, practice assignments, and discussion prompts. 

However, if you provide the actual text related to the topic "The World Wide Web" ( Lesson 15.2 ), I can help summarize it in 6 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, technical details, and important concepts.

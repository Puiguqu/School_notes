Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key Up to now, we've assumed that the server is a single computer. But as we saw when we talked about networks, multiple computers can be networked to perform a single function. This combination of computers is called a cluster. Most modern web servers are implemented as clusters, which means that there are several computers working together to serve a single websites, and the various functions you've learned about are shared between them. Different computers might have different functions, one for the routing and one for the database, or multiple computers might share the same task. In most cases, it will be both. But it's even more complex amount. A single computer doesn't necessarily host just been website. You can have a single big server that hosts many websites. This is normally done by something called virtual servers. These are servers that are implemented in software, so that several virtual servers can run on a single computer. Virtual servers are implemented in one of two ways. The first is a virtual machine. What that means is that one computer implements the machine language of another computer in software, so that each virtual machine seems like its own independent computer with its own operating system and application software, but it's actually implemented in software in another computer. If the physical and virtual machines have the same machine language, this can be made more efficient than it sounds. The other approach is to use something called a container, which is like a virtual machine except that all of the containers share the same operating system kernel, but otherwise act like different computers with different application software. In this case, that's the web server software. Containers are now very popular because they can be more efficient than virtual machines. Most websites are now implemented on Cloud services like Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud. These Cloud servers use both clusters and virtual servers. They consists of huge clusters of computers, and each website has one or more virtual servers implemented not in a single computer but on a cluster. The web is a very important part of our lives now, and because it is used so much, it's really important that it's implemented efficiently. That's why we need such complex architectures for web servers. This lecture's only been able to scratch the surface of how modern websites work. You'll learn a lot more later in your degree, but I hope that it will help you better understand the sites you use every day. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 15.0 Introduction Lesson 15.1 The internet Lesson 15.2 The web Video: Video Web servers .

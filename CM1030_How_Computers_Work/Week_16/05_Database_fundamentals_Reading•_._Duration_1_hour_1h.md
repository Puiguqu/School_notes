[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-how-computers-work/supplement/becb4/database-fundamentals)

There is no text provided for me to summarize. The text appears to be a description of a learning resource, including a reading assignment and practice quiz on database systems from the book "Computer Science: An Overview" by Brookshear and Brylow. If you could provide the actual text, I would be happy to assist you in summarizing it in 14 sentences.

That doesn't necessarily mean things that we will call intelligence in humans. We normally think that someone would need to be very intelligent to play chess to grand master level. But a computer beat the world chess champion Garry Kasparov in the 1990s. On the other hand, tasks that any healthy human could do effortlessly are still incredibly difficult challenges for AI. picking up a glass of water without spilling it or having a conversation about how your day was. In fact, having an ordinary conversation is one of the classic AI challenges enshrined in the Turing test invented by Alan Turing. Turing was not only one of the original inventors of the computer and responsible for breaking the Nazi codes in World War II, he also invented the basic ideas of AI. He asked himself, how would it be possible to decide if a computer is intelligent or not? His idea was based on a popular party game of the time. A woman and a man leave the room, and the players can send questions to each of them on pieces of paper. They have to guess based only on the written answers which is the man and which is the woman. Why not play this game, but instead of a man and a woman, you have to guess between a human and a computer. Modern versions of a test involves chatting to a computer or a human via text message interface and trying to guess which is which. No computer has managed to film most people over a long period of time, but there are systems that fill people in short conversations. Although the Turing test is popular, there were flaws. First, a successful chat box as they're called, often use simple tricks to fool people rather than showing true intelligence. Also there are many challenging areas of AI that aren't covered in the test, like recognizing faces, manipulating physical objects or even driving cars. In fact, AI has split into a wide range of sub fields that address particular challenges like computer vision, computers that can see and understand. Natural language processing, computers that understand human language. Robotics and even computational creativity, computers that can make creative works of art. Many of these sub fields have resulted in computer systems that can do some incredibly useful things, robots that can run our factories. The Google engine which is based on sophisticated natural language processing. And computers that could even diagnose diseases from looking at X-ray scans. We're likely to see a lot of major advances in this type of task specific AI in the near future, but many AI researchers regard this as narrow AI. That it is good as individual tasks but does not have the kind of general task independent intelligence that humans have. This artificial general intelligence is still a long way from being achievable. So how does AI work? There have been many different techniques used over the years, most with only limited success. Often they would work on simple lab problems, but fail to scale up to the complexities of the real world. Early systems were based on logical rules. For example, expert systems were a type of AI system that try to do things that expert humans can do, for example, diagnosing a disease. In this case, there might be a rule saying that if a patient has a pain in the lower abdomen they have appendicitis. One of the big problem is that these rules are very rarely certain, there are many possible reasons for lower abdomen pain. Gradually, researchers developed ways of dealing with this uncertainty, like the mathematics of probability. And expert systems have reasonable success in several domains, but how would you create an expert system for recognizing a face? What are the rules? We humans can do it, but we don't know how we do it. Building expert systems relied on experts knowing the rules they use to make decisions. But very often they're subconscious, we don't quite know how we do things. This is one of the many reasons that most researchers started using a different approach called machine learning. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 17.0 Introduction Lesson 17.1 Artificial intelligence Video: Video Artificial intelligence .

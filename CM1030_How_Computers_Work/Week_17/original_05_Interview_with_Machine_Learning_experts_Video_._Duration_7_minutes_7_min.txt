Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key How are you? We've been learning a lot about machine learning and you've got the basic principles. But today, I'd like to broaden out a bit of your learning by inviting a panel of experts from Goldsmiths, each of whom does some unique purchased machine learning. So let's start by introducing yourselves. Could you each tell our learners who you are and a little bit about what you do? Sure. I will start. I'm Rebecca Fiebrink. I am a reader here at Goldsmiths, and a lot of my research and teaching at Goldsmiths center is around creative uses of technology, and especially creative uses of machine learning. My name is Larisa Soldatova. I am also a reader in Goldsmiths. I've been involved to machine learning projects for two decades. I also lead the online data science program here in Goldsmiths. My name is Jamie Ward. I'm a lecturer here at Goldsmiths. I research at wearable computing, particularly human activity recognition using sensors on those wearable computers. We use machine learning to try and figure out what it is people are doing or who they are engaging with and so forth. Okay, great thank you. We've been learning about how machine learning works, how it's based on data, and the different types of machine learning problems. You can have classification problems, regression problems. Could you tell us each of you, a little bit about machine learning problem that you've been involved in? What kind of data you were using? What you were trying to do and whether it was the classification, regression or something else? I work with biomedical applications and many of them include the drug design. So your data are about the chemical compounds and if they show some activity or not. The pharmaceutical companies are using millions of compounds. They screen it in parallels, those are very expensive. Simply because we don't have this millions to spend on chemicals, we have to be clever. So they use quite interesting machine learning technique called Active Machine Learning, when system can infer what the chemicals will bring maximum information to train your model. So it tells you, this 100, and then you go and buy only the set instead of millions. It works quite well. So the machine learning algorithms is actually telling you what [inaudible] to gather? Yes. It tells you not only to gather, but it was also directing us what to buy to save money. Yes. I'll go next. For about 10 years, I've been working with musicians and artists who are really interested in using supervised learning, so both classification and regression to build things like new musical instruments. An example might be to move around using sensors worn on the body or I've got an example of one of the sensors that might be used. This as a leap motion, which gets information about where your hand is in space and then you can build a classifier to classify whether somebody is doing one action or another. If you want to build a music system from that, your classifier could trigger the playback of one sound sample when you're doing one thing and another sound sample when you're doing another thing. There are all sorts of different sensors that you could use. You could also get data from microphones or from cameras or from other data sources and of course use that to control sound synthesis, use it to control live visuals, or lighting in a performance, or even use it to understand something about, say how a dancer is moving or how a musician is playing their instrument. So what's the benefits of just using the traditional knobs and buttons interface? There are a lot of benefits. The most obvious benefit to somebody who has begun to study machine learning, I think is that machine learning can just make it easier to deal with data that might be complicated or we're in situations where you might have a lot of data. For instance, with something like leap motion. If I'm even just taking the XYZ position of each of my fingertips over this device, if I want to use that to control maybe 10 parameters of a visualization, or animation, or sound, suddenly I have a really complicated programming problem to do and machine learning makes it quite easy to instead of me sitting down and writing that code, I can give a bunch of training data, expressing how I would like that relationship to look, give that data to learning algorithm which then builds me a model. Of course, sometimes I have really complex datasets coming from especially video or audio or other sensors, where it's just impossible for someone even an expert programmer who really knows a lot about signal processing, it's impossible for them to build an accurate model at all without machine learning, and machine learning allows us to do things we just couldn't do before. Okay. Great, thanks. Jamie? Well, my work with the human activity recognition tries to solve a lot of different problems. So we try to pick them out one at a time. For example, one of the areas I was interested in looking at was, what information does the movement of your eyes giveaway? So how you look. So rather than figuring out what you're looking at, figure out what it is you're doing depending on how your eyes move. So if you're reading a book or you're reading some texts, your eyes will jump around in a very particular pattern and we could use little sensors to detect that. You could use cameras, but I'm interested in something that you wear on your body. I've got a gadget to show as well. There are these spectacles that pick up the electrical signals. There are commercial spectacles that pick up the electrical signals that are produced as your eye moves, and we can take those signals and analyze them using machine learning algorithms to figure out how your eyes are moving. Has it made a big jump to the left or to the right or vice versa? So that would be a classification problem. Can you classify in large and small saccades of the eye movement? Then we can feed that into another classifier to try and figure out, is the person reading, or are they having a conversation with someone, or are they watching a video? That's one of the areas that I've been working on, wearable sensing and machine learning. What I found really interesting about all of this is that, a lot of this subtle human behavior, we do it subconsciously. We're not really aware of what we're doing it and that means it will be incredibly hard to try and program a computer program to do this. Is that one of the reasons you're using machine learning? Yeah, absolutely. One of the other things is the oldest non-variable behavior that we give off like you see little movements and things that we're not always conscious of. It would take a computer programmer and a behavioral psychologist years to watch what happens and codify these movements and interactions. But with sensing and with machine learning, we can do all that just using the data itself so that machine learning makes that process an awful lot easier. We can make models of human interaction, human behavior, without having to code them directly. We can learn them. Great. It was really great to hear all your different projects because it shows how diverse machine learning can be, how many different types of data but also how many different kinds of problems it can solve. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 17.0 Introduction Lesson 17.1 Artificial intelligence Lesson 17.2 Machine learning Video: Video Machine learning .

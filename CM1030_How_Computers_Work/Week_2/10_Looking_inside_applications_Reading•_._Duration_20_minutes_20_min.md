Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences:

On a Mac, applications appear to be single files due to the operating system's design, but they are actually folders containing multiple files. To view the contents of an application, navigate to the Applications folder and right-click (or hold down Ctrl and click) on the application icon. Selecting 'Show Package Contents' will reveal all the files that make up the application. Windows is less secretive and allows users to view application folders without special action.

Applications are typically stored in the 'C:\Program Files' directory. This directory contains a folder for each installed application, which includes its executable file, resource files, and libraries (represented by .dll files). To examine the components of an application, look at the files within each application's folder. The files should include the executable (.exe) file, resources files, and libraries.

The Mac requires users to take steps to view the contents of an application, while Windows makes this information more accessible. Understanding how applications are structured can be helpful for debugging and troubleshooting issues. The concept of modularity is relevant here, as applications are composed of multiple components that work together.

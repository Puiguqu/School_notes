Machine learning is about using example data to train a computer to do a task. That means to do a machine learning project, you need to collect data, and train a model. You need to think about what problem you want to solve in machine learning, and what data you'd collect to help solve that problem. You need to make sure your data accurately reflects the real world, and it's enough for the algorithm to learn a working model. Any computing project you do is unlikely to work first time, so you'll need to test it and improve your model by collecting more data or finding the problem. Collecting data, training, and testing are all important parts of the craft of machine learning, something you can only learn by doing it in practice. So, let's get started. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 20.1 Your data science project Practice Assignment: Preparing for your machine learning project .

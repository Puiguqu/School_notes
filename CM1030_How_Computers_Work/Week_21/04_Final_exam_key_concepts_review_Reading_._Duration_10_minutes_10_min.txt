Here is the revised version of your question:

I need help with understanding key concepts in computer science, particularly those related to networks, operating systems, machine learning, and software engineering.

Can you provide me with information on:

1. URL components: What are they, and how do they work?
2. Deadlock in operating systems: How is it defined, and what are the causes and resolution methods?
3. Machine learning classification: Can you explain this concept in detail, including data collection, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation?
4. Software engineering concepts: What are system utilities, memory management, kernel, process scheduling, security threats, and semaphores?

Additionally, can you provide examples of practical applications and real-world scenarios for each of these topics? I would also appreciate any additional resources or references that can help me further understand these concepts.

Please feel free to ask if you need any clarification on the questions.

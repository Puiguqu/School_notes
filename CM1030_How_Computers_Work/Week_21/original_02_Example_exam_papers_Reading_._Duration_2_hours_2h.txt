Here are two examples of previous exam papers for you to practice on. They are in the same format and have the same type of questions you will sit. The first paper is based on an exam sat by students on campus at Goldsmiths, University of London and the second one was sat by University of London Worldwide students in September 2019. You can use them to practice taking the exam yourself. I would recommend taking it under timed conditions (2 hours) so see how you do. There are no answers on the papers. If you are unsure of the correct answer, I want you to go back to that section of the course and check for yourself, that is a key part of the learning that you will be able to do with this exam paper.

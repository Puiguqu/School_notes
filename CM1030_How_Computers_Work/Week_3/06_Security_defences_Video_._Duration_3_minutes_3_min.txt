Protecting against security threats requires understanding various types of threats. Viruses and malicious software are combated using antivirus software that scans for known viruses. Firewalls can prevent unauthorized access to computers, while access control restricts who can access a computer or server by requiring login credentials such as usernames and passwords.

Access controls enable different levels of access to ensure privacy and security. For example, a learner may be able to view videos and take quizzes but not edit grades. System administrators and software developers have the ability to make changes to the system, while teachers can only edit course materials and see grades.

Passwords are crucial for access control, but they can be easily guessed by hackers using automated programs. To mitigate this risk, websites often require users to choose unusual passwords with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters and numbers. However, good passwords can be hard to remember, leading people to use easily guessable variations.

To address this issue, two-factor authentication has become increasingly popular, requiring both a password and a code sent via mobile phone to access a site. This approach is more secure than relying solely on passwords. Understanding computer security is essential to avoid taking unnecessary risks online.

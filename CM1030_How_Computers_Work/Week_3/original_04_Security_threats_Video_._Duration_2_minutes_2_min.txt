The Internet has allowed us to communicate with and work with people all over the world. These are fantastic opportunities, but there are people who approach this technology with malicious intent. As a result, there are many possible threats to our online security that can impact our privacy, our personal data, and even our bank accounts. Many of these threats come from malicious software. A virus is a piece of software that copies itself from one computer to another without your knowledge, and is normally aimed at damaging your computer in some way. This could mean that it slows it down, or interferes in other ways with the working of your operating system, or it could perform specifically harmful actions like stealing your data, or hacking other machines on your network. One example of this is spyware, which records what you do on a computer and sends the information to a third party. That can include recording what you type on your keyboard as a way of getting your password. Malicious software can also take the form of a Trojan horse which appears to be legitimate software, but performs harmful actions in secret. Malicious software is just one type of security threat. Another is that criminals can try and hack computer systems. That means getting access to a system that they would not normally have access to, so they can steal data. Hackers normally do this to web servers or other Internet servers that can contain lots of data rather than hacking anyone's individual computer. One way hackers do this is through a phishing attack. This is where people are fooled into giving away important data like passwords or bank details. This normally happens through a plausible looking email or website that looks like it's from your bank or similar site, but is actually controlled by criminals. All of these are risks that mean you have to be very careful about your security online. In the next few videos, I'll talk about measures that you can take to guard against security threats. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 3.0 Introduction Lesson 3.1: Networks Lesson 3.2: Security Video: Video Security threats .

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

1. The concept of websites is often misunderstood as if they all originate from a single website, but this is not always true.
2. Websites can use embedded functionality and data from third-party sources, such as YouTube or advertising services.
3. Online payments are typically handled through embedding with specialized services like PayPal.
4. An Application Programming Interface (API) is a version of the website designed for computer programs, allowing other servers to access data and create new websites.
5. APIs enable different versions of the same application, available on both websites and mobile apps.
6. Major online applications are often accessed through multiple channels, including websites and mobile apps, with different API versions for each platform.
7. Developers use APIs to provide data to their applications, which can be used to create new experiences on different platforms.
8. Twitter's popularity is partly due to third-party developers creating mobile apps using its API, which were available before the company created its own app.
9. The complexity of a website has increased with the addition of embedded information and APIs, making it harder to determine the sources of data used.
10. Websites now incorporate information from multiple sources, including third-party services and APIs.
11. Understanding how websites combine data from different sources can help identify the origins of information used on a website.
12. Embedding allows websites to reuse functionality and data from other servers, reducing development time and costs.
13. APIs provide a standardized way for applications to access data and communicate with each other.
14. The use of APIs has enabled the creation of multiple versions of the same application, catering to different platforms and user needs.
15. Developers must consider API design and implementation when creating web applications that need to interact with multiple sources and platforms.

You may contract your selection using shift + CTRL + arrow key. For screen readers that are incompatible with using arrow keys for shortcuts, you can replace them with the H J K L keys. Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key Over this course so far, you have learned a lot of computer science ideas. Now, let us put them together to understand the complex bit of software, a modern website. Before we go into detail, I should talk about two terms that were often confused. The Internet and the World Wide Web. The Internet describes the underlying network that connects computers together across the world. The World Wide Web is a way of communicating and sharing information that uses the Internet. It consists of web pages that are viewed through a web browser like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge. Almost anything you would view through a web browser is part of the World Wide Web. The Internet is a network that connects computers together. The web, consists of pages connected by links. A webpage is a single document on the web which is loaded into your browser at a given time. A website is a collection of pages. For example, all the webpages for Goldsmiths. The web is the most popular use of the Internet, but there are many other uses of the Internet. Email is not distributed via the web. Although you can access your email through a webpage, the emails themselves are sent through a different protocol. Another popular use of the Internet is video and audio conferencing, which happens via applications like Skype, not via the web. We have talked about webpages, but a modern website is a lot more than a collection of pages. They are interactive, make use of data from many sources, and are constantly updating based on how people are interacting with the site. Examples include webmail applications like Gmail, social networks like Twitter, and even online courses like this one. Because modern websites are so complex, they are examples of all the computer science concepts we've seen so far. So, knowing these concepts will help you understand websites. The next few videos will guide you through the process of applying that learning. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 4.1 Web applications Video: Video Websites .

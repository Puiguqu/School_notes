Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key We've learned a lot of computer science concepts in this course, state, modularity, networks, and security. Let's see how they can be applied to creating a notional machine of a website. The most obviously applicable of these ideas to the web is networks. The web works over the Internet, so it's a technology that is fundamentally about communicating over networks. The web is not so much about individual people communicating with each other, but much more about people getting information from organizations. You might communicate with others on a site like Facebook, but you're doing it on Facebook's web page. What that means technically is that while we might access a web page from a web browser on a phone or laptop, the web pages themselves are on an organization's web server. When you get a web page for an organisation, the data is transferred between a server and a client. A client is a word we use for essentially a computer that a person is working on. A server is a computer that holds information including web pages, that are used by many people via different clients. The term "clients" is used both for the computer itself and also for the software used to access the server, in other words, your web browser. As we've seen before, communication over the Internet happens by sending messages called packets from one computer to another. These packets obey a protocol that allows them to communicate. So how does this work with websites? any communication over the Internet, web applications use the Internet Protocol or IP. But they also use another protocol on top of IP called HTTP, short for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. In fact, a more technical definition of the worldwide web is that it's anything that uses HTTP. To access a website, your browser sends an HTTP request, this is a packet that ask for a web page. An HTTP request consists mostly of a URL like this one. The first part is HTTP, which means that it's using the HTTP protocol. The next part is the domain name. You can think of this as the name of the website. The next part tells us serve exactly what page of a website you want. Some URLs also have a final part called the query string. This is used because, in fact, websites did not consist only of preexisting pages that you download. While this was true in the early days of the web, it stopped being through a long time ago. A lot of the time web pages are created especially for you based on your requirements. The query allows you to specify those requirements. One good example of the use of a query is a web search. When you perform a search, you enter particular words which are your search terms. These terms become parts of your query and allow the search engine to create a page of results that are specifically designed for your needs. Once the web server gets your query, it will send back the web pages, a web page is generally too big for single packet, so it will be split up into several packets. In particular, some elements like pictures will be sent separately from the text. That's why if you've got a slow connection, you often get the text of your page before the images load. So, a modern website is a good example of a networked application. The first part of your national machine of the web, is it works by transferring packets across the Internet, between clients and servers. The client sends HTTP requests and the servers send back web pages. Now, let's look at how some other computer science ideas apply to the web. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 4.1 Web applications Video: Video Websites .

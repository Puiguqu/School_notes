You may contract your selection using shift + CTRL + arrow key. For screen readers that are incompatible with using arrow keys for shortcuts, you can replace them with the H J K L keys. Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key Websites can use data from many different places on the internet to bring you their web pages. But that also means that the data you provide to websites can go to many different places. A good notional machine of a website will help you understand what happens to your data and make sure that it's secure. Websites need your data to provide you with certain services. Online shopping sites need to know your address so they can deliver physical products to you. And social networks would be pretty useless without them being able to show your name. Some sites provide very advanced personalisation. Google can provide you search results that are likely to be the ones that you really want as opposed to generic results that apply to everyone. Amazon can provide you targeted recommendations for products that you might actually like, unlike generic in-store promotions. But this kind of personalisation relies on them collecting data about you without you necessarily being aware of it. In the example of the online shop, they track what you've searched for, looked at and bought before in order to change the way they interact with you. Because modern websites can include content from many places through embedding and APIs, this means that there are lots of services that can track you without you knowing about it. This is particularly controversial with advertising. An advertising service can track your behaviour across many sites that it's used by. The adverts you see on websites are not just images. They're little embedded programs that can track what you're doing on the webpage they're embedded in. That's why looking at something on one site can result in you getting targeted ads for the same product in a completely unrelated site. I'm not saying that all data collection is bad. The web wouldn't work without it. And many websites fund themselves through advertising, so they wouldn't be able to do what they do without it. But it's worth trying to be more aware of all the ways data is collected about you, at least so you can do something about it in cases where you don't want your data collected. For example, you could use private mode in your browser. Knowing more about how websites work will help you do that. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 4.1 Web applications Video: Video Websites .

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) is a standard for representing texts that includes all English alphabet letters, numbers, and special characters in seven bits. However, this standard does not accommodate languages like French or German, which have accents, and excludes the majority of the world's population. A new standard called Unicode can represent almost any writing system and is extensible to include other writing systems. Many computer systems still use ASCII, but it is being replaced by Unicode. Text and numbers are a common combination in computer data, such as web pages, spreadsheets, and corporate databases. Images and sounds can also be represented as complex data. Pixels, or picture elements, make up images, with millions of pixels in modern pictures. Brightness is typically represented by eight bits, creating shades between black and white. Colors are created using three numbers (red, green, and blue) and a fourth number for transparency (alpha). The alpha channel allows for transparent images, where an alpha value of 0 means complete transparency. Videos are created by having sequences of images, which can be built from simple bits. Audio is represented as a series of microscopic changes in air pressure recorded as numbers, typically over 44,000 times per second. Sound files are made up of individual samples, and videos can include millions of numbers, making them large data files that can fill up memory chips and hard disks. Understanding how data is represented is crucial for computer performance, especially when working with complex data like images and audio. As a computer scientist, it's essential to understand data representation and design new representations to optimize data storage and processing.

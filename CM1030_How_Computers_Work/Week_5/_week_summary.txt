## Data storage
Video•
. Duration: 7 minutes

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

The main memory of a computer stores information that is currently being used, whereas mass storage holds data permanently. Main memory uses microchips called Random Access Memory (RAM) to store information, while mass storage is achieved through various technologies such as hard disks, optical drives, and flash storage. Microchips handle bits, which can represent true or false values. The simplest operation on a bit is flipping it, making it its opposite. More complex operations combine two bits, such as AND, which produces an output of one if both inputs are one, but zero otherwise. A flip-flop circuit can store information by receiving a one on its top input, resulting in a one output that remains even when the input stops. This circuit is the basis of main memory chips. Mass storage devices vary widely, including hard disks, optical drives, and flash storage. SSDs (solid-state drives) are slower than RAM but much faster than traditional hard disks. Optical drives are slow to write to, making them suitable for permanent archiving rather than frequently changing documents. The tradeoff between storage capacity, power usage, and speed is significant in computer design. Modern computers often employ multiple types of storage, such as SSDs and hard disks, to balance these competing factors. Cloud storage offers massive hard disk space and guaranteed data retention, but at the cost of slower access times. Additionally, some main memory systems include a cache, which stores frequently accessed data for rapid retrieval.

## Why does my computer slow down if I open a big file?

. Duration: 2 minutes

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

The main memory is much faster than hard disks, which can slow down the loading of large files into an application. When a large file is loaded, it can freeze the application due to the slower speed of hard disks compared to main memory. However, this is not the only reason for slowing down after loading a large file; even if the file's loaded, the operating system may still be slowed down by other applications or processes using up all available main memory. When main memory becomes full, virtual memory is used to save some of the data to hard disk storage in an area called virtual memory. Virtual memory tries to minimize the amount of data stored in it that would otherwise be needed immediately. However, hard disks and virtual memory are much slower than real memory, which can slow down applications when using files stored in virtual memory. Upgrading memory is generally cheaper and easier than upgrading processors, making it a more cost-effective solution for slowing down issues caused by insufficient main memory. The operating system uses algorithms to decide what data should be stored in virtual memory, prioritizing the most critical or frequently used data over others. When an application runs out of main memory, it can switch between different applications and processes to find available space before loading a new file into memory. However, if the load is too large, the operating system may not have enough time to process the switch before loading the new file into virtual memory. If this happens repeatedly, it can cause an application or entire system to freeze due to the slow speed of hard disks and virtual memory. This slowdown can be mistaken for a processor problem but is often caused by insufficient main memory. The amount of data that needs to be stored in virtual memory depends on various factors such as the size of the file being loaded, how much RAM is available, and other processes competing for resources.

## Bytes and numbers

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Bits are simple representations that can be used for various types of data. To represent more complex data, bits must be combined together. In modern computers, memory is addressed in larger chunks, such as bytes, which are eight bits. Bytes are the standard measure of memory and are often too small to access directly on a computer. The smallest element that can be accessed is typically 64 bits or 8 bytes. This may seem inefficient, but accessing data in 64-bit chunks speeds up the computer.

A byte can represent 256 different patterns of ones and zeros called bit patterns, each representing something different, such as letters, numbers, or colors. Numbers are useful because they can be used to represent other types of data. In the decimal system, each place value is multiplied by a power of 10, while in binary, each place value is multiplied by a power of 2. Binary notation can be used to represent decimal numbers as a pattern of bits.

A single byte can only represent up to 255 numbers, but most computers use 32-bit or 64-bit representations, which can handle much larger numbers, including positive and negative values, as well as fractions. Numbers are the fundamental building block of everything on a computer and will be used as the basis for understanding other data representations.

The decimal system is based on powers of 10, while binary is based on powers of 2, but both use place value to represent numbers. This concept can also be applied to other types of data, such as letters, images, and sounds. Understanding how bits, bytes, and numbers work together is essential for grasping computer science concepts.

## Other types of data

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) is a standard for representing texts that includes all English alphabet letters, numbers, and special characters in seven bits. However, this standard does not accommodate languages like French or German, which have accents, and excludes the majority of the world's population. A new standard called Unicode can represent almost any writing system and is extensible to include other writing systems. Many computer systems still use ASCII, but it is being replaced by Unicode. Text and numbers are a common combination in computer data, such as web pages, spreadsheets, and corporate databases. Images and sounds can also be represented as complex data. Pixels, or picture elements, make up images, with millions of pixels in modern pictures. Brightness is typically represented by eight bits, creating shades between black and white. Colors are created using three numbers (red, green, and blue) and a fourth number for transparency (alpha). The alpha channel allows for transparent images, where an alpha value of 0 means complete transparency. Videos are created by having sequences of images, which can be built from simple bits. Audio is represented as a series of microscopic changes in air pressure recorded as numbers, typically over 44,000 times per second. Sound files are made up of individual samples, and videos can include millions of numbers, making them large data files that can fill up memory chips and hard disks. Understanding how data is represented is crucial for computer performance, especially when working with complex data like images and audio. As a computer scientist, it's essential to understand data representation and design new representations to optimize data storage and processing.

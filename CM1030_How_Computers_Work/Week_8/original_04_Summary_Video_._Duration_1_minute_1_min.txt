Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key Well done. You've now got to the core of what makes up the computer, the CPU and memory. These are the most basic aspects of computer hardware. You've also learned how they interact with peripheral devices to make all the sight, sound, and interactions we associate with computers and smartphones. You've even learned about machine language, the basic language that CPUs can execute and how the complex software we use must all be converted down into a small number of basic instructions. What you've learned in this topic is the lowest level of abstraction that you normally need to think about as a computer scientist. Using CPUs, memory, machine language, and peripherals, we can create highly complex software and even global computer systems that can communicate over the Internet. In the rest of this course, you will learn about some of these. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 8.1 Communicating with devices Lesson 8.2 Summary Peer-graded Assignment: How does code work? .

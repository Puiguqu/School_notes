Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences:

The graphical user interface (GUI) is a crucial part of an operating system, but there's more to it than what you can see. An operating system has a kernel that provides fundamental functionality such as access to hardware, networking, and files. The kernel is the core of the operating system, and it supports both applications and utilities. Utilities are small applications bundled with the operating system, such as calculators, calendars, and time settings. These utilities provide standard functions that are not part of the operating system itself.

The GUI of an operating system provides menus, docks, and windows for individual applications. The window manager is a part of the operating system that supplies space on the screen for applications. The operating system can also supply basic user interface elements such as buttons and text entry boxes. These GUI libraries are often provided by the operating system or third-party vendors.

The kernel is responsible for providing access to hardware, networking, and files. It manages memory allocation and file systems. An operating system supports both individual applications and utilities, which rely on the kernel for functionality. Programming skills are essential for computer scientists, as it involves writing code that makes software work.

Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key In this video, I'm going to talk about an operating system that lots of people have never heard of, but almost all of us use almost every day. That is an operating system called Unix. I'm pretty confident that almost all of you will be using Unix or at least an operating system based on Unix almost everyday of your lives, and I'm going to explain why. Unix originated in the 1970s. It was developed at the AT&T Corporation as the operating system for their computers, and it became extremely popular. The main reason for that was that it was written in a high level language called C, which meant that it was easy to make it work on different computer architectures. Up till then, operating systems have been written in machine language and could only run on the original computer they were designed for. So in the 70s and 80s, the Unix operating system was used in lots and lots of professional settings, and was pretty much the standard for lots of computer scientists. But then, AT&T tried to lock it down and stop users altering it and changing the code. Since most of those users were programmers, a lot of them didn't like that. They liked to be able to change the code. In particular, somebody called Richard Stallman decided to create his own version of Unix that would be open and free to access so that anyone could change it. That was the origin of what's called the "free software movement" and a variant called the "open-source-software Movement." Now, Richard Stallman implemented a lot of what makes up Unix, but he mostly worked on the utilities. He created free versions of almost all the utilities that came at stand with Unix. In those days, there weren't graphical applications, they were textual. But there were utilities very much like the ones I described in an earlier video. What was missing was the kernel, and it was someone in Finland called Linus Torvalds who implemented a free software kernel for Unix which he called "Linux," naming it after himself. Since then, Linux has become incredibly popular and is almost the standard version of Unix now. His kernel together with Stallman's utilities and a bunch of other software has become standard in a lot of computer uses, particularly web servers. So, although not many people have Linux on their own computer, a lot of people will use websites whose servers used Linux as the operating system for the web server. So, every time you use a website, you're probably using Linux. Having said that, there were relatively easy to use version of Linux that is designed for normal computers. For example, the Ubuntu version of Linux developed in South Africa is very popular. A lot of computer scientists like to use Ubuntu for their desktop or laptop computer. But it isn't just web servers and computer scientists who use it. You probably run Unix on your mobile phone. Linux was not the only version of Unix that emerged and became free. At Berkeley in the University of California, they develop their own free version of Unix called BSD. BSD had a more permissive license. Linux, because of it's copyright license, cannot be integrated with commercial software, but BSD can. So, what happened was that Steve Jobs, one of the founders of Apple, decided to use BSD as the basis of an operating system called "NeXTSTEP," that he was developing for his new company, NeXT. BSD was the kernel of that operating system and would provide the graphical user interface. Eventually, when Jobs rejoined Apple, that operating system became OS X, which is the current version of the Mac operating system. So, if you have a Mac, even though the graphical user interface is entirely Apple's, the kernel is a Unix-like kernel called BSD. That also means that if you have an iPhone, you're also running BSD, because the iPhone operating system was developed from the Mac operating system and all the Apple operating systems use BSD as their kernel. Similarly, Android uses the Linux kernel. So, if you use an Android phone, then you are using Linux every day even though you might not know it. All of these systems I've talked about have very different graphical user interfaces. They look and behave extremely differently. So, you wouldn't know that there was any similarity between their operating systems, but actually, at their heart, their kernels are very, very similar and are all based on the original design of Unix. So, in fact, the only times that you don't use the Unix nowadays are when you're using a computer or phone based on Windows. Microsoft is the exception. It has developed his own kernel, it's own user interface, and Windows is completely independent of Unix, although they also learned quite a lot from the design of the Unix operating system. So, Unix was really the fundamental inspiration for all modern operating systems, and therefore is immensely important. It's definitely something you should find out about, and maybe as you continue your work as a computer scientist, you might also want to think about starting to use Unix instead of the operating system you currently use, or making more use of the Unix features of your current operating system. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 9.0 Introduction Lesson 9.1: What is an operating system?

## VIDEO TRANSCRIPT ## You may navigate through the transcript using tab. To save a note for a section of text press CTRL + S. To expand your selection you may use CTRL + arrow key. You may contract your selection using shift + CTRL + arrow key. For screen readers that are incompatible with using arrow keys for shortcuts, you can replace them with the H J K L keys. Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key Are you a Windows person or a Mac person?...

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences:

The graphical user interface (GUI) is a crucial part of an operating system, but there's more to it than what you can see. An operating system has a kernel that provides fundamental functionality such as access to hardware, networking, and files. The kernel is the core of the operating system, and it supports both applications and utilities. Utilities are small applications bundled with the operating system, such as calculators, calendars, and time settings. These utilities provide standard functions that are not part of the operating system itself.

The GUI of an operating system provides menus, docks, and windows for individual applications. The window manager is a part of the operating system that supplies space on the screen for applications. The operating system can also supply basic user interface elements such as buttons and text entry boxes. These GUI libraries are often provided by the operating system or third-party vendors.

The kernel is responsible for providing access to hardware, networking, and files. It manages memory allocation and file systems. An operating system supports both individual applications and utilities, which rely on the kernel for functionality. Programming skills are essential for computer scientists, as it involves writing code that makes software work.

## UNIX Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-how-computers-work/lecture/AJ8f1/unix)

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Unix was developed in the 1970s at AT&T Corporation as an operating system for their computers. It became extremely popular due to its high-level language syntax (C) allowing it to run on different computer architectures. Unix was initially used in professional settings and was the standard for many computer scientists. However, AT&T attempted to restrict users from modifying the code, leading Richard Stallman to create his own version of Unix that would be open-source and free to access. This led to the "free software movement" and the "open-source-software Movement." Stallman primarily worked on utilities, creating free versions of most standard Unix utilities.

Linus Torvalds implemented a free software kernel for Unix called Linux, naming it after himself. The Linux kernel became incredibly popular and is now almost the standard version of Unix. The Linux kernel is used in various systems, including web servers, mobile phones, and operating systems like Android. Linux-based systems use a permissive license, allowing commercial integration with other software.

In contrast, BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution) has a more permissive license, making it compatible with commercial software. Steve Jobs used BSD as the basis for his NeXTSTEP operating system, which later became OS X when he rejoined Apple. The Mac operating system still uses a Unix-like kernel called BSD, and iPhone devices also run on BSD. Android phones use the Linux kernel.

Unix is considered a fundamental inspiration for modern operating systems, including Windows. However, Microsoft developed its own kernel, user interface, and Windows is independent of Unix. Unix's legacy can be seen in various systems, and learning about it is essential for computer scientists.

## File systems and memory management Video• . Duration: 6 minutes 6 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-how-computers-work/lecture/7MdG2/file-systems-and-memory-management)

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

The operating system kernel provides fundamental services to applications, including managing device drivers. Device drivers allow applications to interact with hardware, such as printers, while providing a standard interface for all applications. The kernel manages drivers and interacts with them to communicate with the underlying hardware. One important function of the kernel is to provide an interface for mass storage devices, such as hard disks, and manage files and folders.

The file manager is responsible for storing and managing metadata associated with files, including dates and owners. Folders, also known as directories, contain files and can be nested to create a hierarchical structure. The kernel provides a standard interface for applications to access the file system, allowing them to organize and retrieve files efficiently. Another important function of the kernel is to manage memory allocation and deallocation for applications.

The kernel allocates memory addresses to applications when they start up, ensuring that each application has its own area of memory. The kernel also prevents one application from accessing the memory of another, preventing conflicts and potential security vulnerabilities. When memory becomes full, the kernel can move data from main memory to hard disk storage using a process called paging.

Paging involves copying chunks of memory, known as pages, to disk storage when they are not in use. This frees up space for other applications and allows the kernel to provide virtual memory, which is essentially disc space that acts like memory. The kernel's memory management function provides basic services that applications need over time, such as loading files and accessing memory.

## Chat App Video• . Duration: 4 minutes 4 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-how-computers-work/lecture/4dxdO/chat-app)

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

An operating system (OS) provides a platform for applications to run on mobile devices such as phones. On a phone, the OS provides screen space for the app, GUI widgets like title bars and buttons, and keyboard support through software keyboards. The OS also manages memory allocation for apps, even when only one app is visible at a time. Mobile OSes are more ruthless about memory use and background apps due to power consumption concerns. Apps can be suspended or terminated if they consume too much power. Chat apps, like WeChat, WhatsApp, and others, require the OS to provide screen space, GUI widgets, keyboard support, and network connectivity. When typing on a software keyboard, touch input is received by the touch screen driver and fed to the virtual keyboard software, which sends the message to the app. The app calls the GUI library to draw the text on screen, while also sending messages to the network drivers for internet connectivity. Most chat apps save sent photos to permanent storage, such as SSDs, in a file system organized by folders. File systems organize files and directories, with chat apps often having their own folder for stored images and chats. Some chat apps backup data to cloud storage for easy access on multiple devices. This involves interaction between the file system, network drivers, and other OS services. The OS provides various functions such as application loading, memory management, and GUI support for apps like chat apps. Understanding how these OS functions work is essential for developing efficient and user-friendly mobile applications. By analyzing the relationships between an operating system, its components, and mobile apps, developers can create better experiences for users.

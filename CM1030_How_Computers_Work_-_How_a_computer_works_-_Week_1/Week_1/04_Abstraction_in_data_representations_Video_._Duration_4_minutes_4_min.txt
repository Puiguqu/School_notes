The concept of abstraction in computer science refers to a simplified representation of software or technology that focuses on essential details while ignoring complexity. Abstraction helps us understand computers by providing a way to think about complex systems in simpler terms. In the context of video, it can be represented as electrical charges, magnetization, tiny pulses of light, or electromagnetic waves. However, regardless of the physical representation, the essence of the video remains the same. To simplify this concept, we can represent things as numbers, which is a fundamental abstraction used in computer science. A computer picture is composed of a grid of pixels, each with a color that can be represented by three numbers (red, green, and blue). This allows us to build abstractions such as pixels and colors, which are easier to understand than the raw data. By simplifying further, we can represent the video as a sequence of pictures, making it more accessible for different applications. The layers of abstraction provide a hierarchical structure, with each layer being simpler and more abstract than the one beneath it. This structure allows us to build complex systems from simpler ones, making them easier to understand and use. Abstraction is crucial in computer science, as everything learned will often be more complex than how it's described. The simple abstract version will be easier to understand and more useful for most applications. In this course, we will explore various abstractions and their applications in computer science.

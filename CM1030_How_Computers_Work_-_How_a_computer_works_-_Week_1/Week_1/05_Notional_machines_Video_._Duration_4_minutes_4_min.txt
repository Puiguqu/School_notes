Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

The concept of abstraction is crucial in computer science as it allows for simplification of complex systems. Abstraction can be represented in various ways, including art and representation of video on a computer. Computers are not just for storing data, but also for performing actions, making abstraction a necessary tool to understand these actions.

In the context of software, abstraction refers to the representation of complex actions as simple machines, known as notional machines. A notional machine is a simplified version of a software's functionality that captures its essence without considering the complexity of the underlying code. The video player is an example of a software that can be represented using a notional machine.

A video player involves transmitting and receiving data over the internet, decoding compressed video, processing it, and displaying it on screen. However, when using a video player, we don't need to consider these details; instead, we think of it as a simple abstraction. The video itself can be represented as a sequence of pictures laid out along a timeline.

A playhead is used to identify the current position in the video, and moving forward along the timeline automatically plays the next image. This concept forms the basis of a notional machine for a video player. Notional machines are useful for controlling software by ignoring its complexity and capturing its essence.

The rest of the course will explore creating notional machines for various types of software and learning building blocks to apply to these machines.

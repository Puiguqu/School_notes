I teach computing at Goldsmiths, which is part of the University of London. This course is about computer science. The simplest definition of computer science is that it's a science of computers. Some people would argue with that definition saying that we need something a bit more sophisticated. But for the purpose of this course, I think it's actually a very good definition. Science is about understanding things. Just as biology helps us understand living things better, and social sciences help us understand society, computer science can help us understand computers better. But you might also just be interested in understanding computers because you use them in your daily life, as so many of us do. I know for certain that you're using your computer right now to watch this video. Even if you're using a phone or a tablet instead of a laptop, these devices are still in essence computers. While they look different and have different user interfaces, deep down inside, they all work the same. This course will help you understand computers better. But it isn't a how-to manual for a particular piece of software. There are plenty of those. Instead, it will introduce you to some of the ideas that computer scientists use on a daily basis to think about and understand computers. But it's not an entirely theoretical course either. We'll be applying these ideas to exactly the kinds of practical problems that computer users come up against every day. It's just that these ideas don't just apply to the problems of software we'll talk about in this course. They can apply to almost anything you do with a computer. So, I'm really looking forward to guiding through your first steps in computer science. Let's get started. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 1.0 Introduction Video: Video What is computer science and how can it help us? .

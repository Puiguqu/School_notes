That was a lie. You won't understand how a computer works because nobody understands how a computer works. In this lecture, I'm going to talk about why you can't understand how a computer works and what you can understand. So let's start with a web page like the one you're watching this video on. A web page, certainly a modern web page with media is a very complex bit of software. It works within a browser like Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari or Microsoft Edge. These modern browsers have very complex bits of software. But a browser is just an application that one's on top of an operating system, like Microsoft Windows, Mac OS, or Linux. These are among the most complex pieces of software we have at the moment. Operating systems run on computers, which themselves are complicated combinations of different hardware. But the essence of them is that there are a bunch of mathematical operations that happen on the CPU, the central processing unit or the main microchip that runs your computer. Within that microchip, all these operations are actually due to crazy quantum stuff that is happening in the semiconductors that these chips are made of. So how can we understand a web page, which we started with, in terms of all this crazy quantum stuff? We can't. It's just far too complex. The quantum stuff is hard to understand in itself, but the number of quantum operations that make up a web page is astounding. Computer speed is generally measured in gigahertz. One gigahertz is about a billion mathematical operations per second. Memory is measured in gigabytes, billions of numbers that can be stored in computer memory. How can one person keep track of all these billions of operation, these billions of numbers? We can't. Nobody is capable of holding that much stuff in their head. That's why we have computers to do it. That's why no one can really fully understand how a computer works. So what can we do? Do we have to just give up and assume they're like magic? No, but we need our first computer science concept: abstraction. What is abstraction? Well, you might know about abstract art. This is a highly realistic painting by Johannes Vermeer. It's trying as hard as possible to represent the world this particular building as it really is. It's an amazing technical achievement, but it's definitely not abstract. This is another painting by Piet Mondrian. Now this is very much what we think about as abstract art. It doesn't represent anything at all. We look at it for the beauty of the shapes, not any representation of the world. But although it's clearly abstract, it's not really what I mean by abstraction either. This is more like it. This is a painting by Amedeo Modigliani. It's definitely a picture of a woman. I think most people would recognize that. But it isn't trying to represent her in full realistic detail as she really is. What it's trying to do is take some key features of her appearance and represent them in a simpler form. What that does is actually emphasize some elements of our personality more than would happen if the image was trying to be really realistic. What we have here is what I call an abstraction of a person. So abstract pictures draw attention to key features of what they're representing without confusing us or distracting us with a lot of detail. That's why they use a lot in engineering drawings. You might not want to realistic picture of the whole engine when you're learning about how it works. It's too confusing. There's too much stuff going on. It can be hard to understand. Instead often a simplified diagram does exactly what you want. You can really pick out the important features of what's going on in the mechanism. In computer science terms, Vermeer is giving you the full billion numbers, everything that is there. Humans are very good at understanding images, so the picture is fine. But if we were talking about a billion numbers on a computer chip instead of an image, it would be way too much for us to understand. On the other hand, Modigliani with his abstraction is simplifying it down some key features so that we can understand what's going on in the picture without having to deal with those whole billion numbers worth of detail, and that's what abstraction in computer science tries to do. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 1.0 Introduction Lesson 1.1 Abstraction Video: Video Abstraction .

The following resource provides a review of the key concepts, skills and knowledge you will need to successfully pass the mid-term exam. Encryption Encryption converts data into a coded format to prevent unauthorised access. This ensures that only those with the correct decryption key can read the information, protecting sensitive data from hackers. Dynamic libraries Dynamic libraries are collections of code that applications use at runtime but are not included in the main executable file. This allows for modular programming and efficient memory usage, as the same library can be used by multiple programs simultaneously. Memory addresses A memory address is a unique identifier for a specific location in a computer's memory. It allows the CPU to access and manipulate data stored at that location efficiently. Peripheral devices and system bus Peripheral devices like keyboards and mice connect to the system bus via device controllers. These controllers manage the communication between the peripheral and the CPU, enabling input and output operations. Domain names and IP addresses A domain name is a human-readable address used to access websites (e.g., www.london.ac.uk ). It maps to an IP address, which is a numerical label assigned to each device on a network (e.g., 158.223.43.141). Domain names are easier for humans to remember and use. Utilities Utilities are small, specialised software programs designed to perform specific tasks like disk formatting, file management and system diagnostics. These tools help maintain and optimise the computer's performance. MEMLOAD instruction The MEMLOAD instruction is used in computing to load data from main memory into a register. This is a crucial operation for data manipulation and processing within the CPU. Computer security Malware often fails due to system security measures. Background processes, privileged instructions and administrator access are tightly controlled by the operating system to prevent unauthorised actions, making it difficult for viruses to operate unnoticed. File size comparisons An uncompressed image of 896x1024 pixels can be compared to text in terms of file size. For example, if each pixel is represented by a byte, the image would be roughly equivalent to 917,504 bytes or approximately a million words in ASCII text. Data compression techniques Run-length encoding is a simple compression technique that is most effective on images with large areas of uniform colour, such as cartoons. It reduces file size by encoding consecutive identical values as a single value and count. By mastering these concepts and skills, you will be well-prepared to successfully complete the 'How Computers Work' mid-term exam.

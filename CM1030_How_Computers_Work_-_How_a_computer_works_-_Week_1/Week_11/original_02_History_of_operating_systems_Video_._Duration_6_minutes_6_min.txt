Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key I've got a pretty powerful computer on my wrist. But computers weren't always this small or even this powerful. This is the first ever fully operational computer. It's called EDSAC, and it was built at the University of Cambridge. And this person designed EDSAC, his name is Maurice Wilkes. I highlight that because Maurice Wilkes actually taught me. When I was at university, he was already retired. But he came in to give a few guest lectures and share his experience of a history of computing. So this shows, in a way, how recent computing is as a discipline. You are being taught by somebody who was taught by the person who built the first ever computer. Now, to be fair, when I say it's the first ever computer, several people would argue with that. There were lots of people trying to build computers around the same time. And this Is ACE, a computer that was built at the University of Manchester in Northern England. ACE was actually working first, but it was just a prototype. EDSAC was the first to be fully working and in use. ACE was built by Alan Turing. Alan Turing was a real genius. He laid the mathematical foundations of computing, and also developed the first ideas in artificial intelligence. As we can see, he was responsible for building one of the first ever computers. And he was also a war hero because he was one of th most important people in decrypting the Nazi German codes during the Second World War. But Alan Turing wasn't the only other person working on computers. John Von Neumann, J Presper Eckert, and John Mauchly in the US actually laid the technical foundations and came up with the first plans for computer. And this work was used by both Wilkes and Turing as the basis of their machines. So lots of people were trying to invent computer at the same time, and it was a bit of a race. Now, these early computers didn't have an operating system at all. The closest they got to an operating system was sign up sheet outside the door. You had to sign up to say, I'm going to use this computer from 10 o'clock to 11 o'clock, and you just went and did all the computations you could in the time that was available to you. That often literally meant setting switches on the control panel. You didn't have a keyboard, you didn't have a screen or anything like that. The next big innovation was this. This is a punched card, which was used to enter programs into computers. It's an example of a bit of a program, and I think at the top you can just about see what the program was doing. Z(1) = Y + W (1), whatever that means. Now, you can see that there were numbers printed on the card, and these little red marks are holes in that card. To program a punch card, you would make holes in the card at the positions of the numbers you wanted to select. Those numbers represent machine instructions, just as we saw in the lesson on machine language. Programmers would feed these cards into a special reader, and the computer would interpret those machine instructions and run the program. So the whole program had to run fast enough that you could instantly see the results of your calculation. Now, what kind of amazing, massive computer would you need to enable you to do something and get the results instantly? Sorry, one sec. Okay, so now I've got an interactive computer on my wrist. But in those days, the 1970s, interactive computers were big powerful things. They sat in air-conditioned rooms and they were too expensive for every single person to have one on their desk. The thing with a screen and keyboard isn't actually a computer, it's a terminal. All terminals did was input and output, and they were linked to the main computer. Several people would be working on the same computer at the same time using these terminals. And this is what is a called a multi-processing or timesharing computer. Nowadays, most of us have our own computers. We have our own phones, some of us even have computers in our watches. So it's less common for people to share their primary computer in this way. But it doesn't mean that timesharing isn't relevant anymore. On one level, we still do timeshare with websites. So you're streaming this video at the same time as many other people are streaming videos from the same server. You are essentially timesharing the web server which is holding all the video data. Another reason why timesharing is still necessary is that you might have one computer just for you. But you'll be running many applications at the same time, and those applications have to share the same CPU. We'll come back to how that's possible. But in even more recent computers, we've gone slightly further because a modern computer doesn't have just one CPU. Many modern computers are multi-core, which means they have several CPUs. And what that means is that we can run several applications on different CPUs. But typically we have many more applications than we have CPUs. We still have to allocate applications to CPUs in a way that makes most efficient use of those CPUs. So for example, we might have two applications on the first CPU, if they don't need much processing power. The next two can share another CPU. But maybe the last one is really processor intensive, so it has to have a CPU to itself. The task of allocating applications to CPUs so as to most efficiently use computing resources is called load balancing. And that becomes very important in the modern world of multi-core processing. So you can see that a lot of the development of computers, and in particular operating systems, is about how to manage computer programs, right up to modern applications. And how to manage the fact that you're likely to have lots of programs running on the same computer. And that's the thing we're going to look at for the rest of this topic. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 11.0 Introduction Lesson 11.1 History of operating systems Video: Video History of operating systems .

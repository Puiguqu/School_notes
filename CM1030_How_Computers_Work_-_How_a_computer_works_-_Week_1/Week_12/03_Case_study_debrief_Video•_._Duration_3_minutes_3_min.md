Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

The operating system manages memory allocation to applications, which may need to request additional memory if they load large data. Applications also interact with the file system, using device drivers for graphics, keyboard, mouse, and touchscreen functionality. Processes are essential for concurrent application usage, as the operating system switches between them.

To minimize interruptions, some applications, like a video player, process data directly in memory, while others, such as a note-taking app, load large files into memory at once. The video player may need to access network drivers if streaming from the internet, whereas the note-taking app relies heavily on keyboard drivers. 

The operating system uses processes differently, with the video player constantly performing tasks and requiring frequent interruptions for other applications. In contrast, the note-taking app spends most of its time waiting for user input, only executing when interrupted by the keyboard.

Despite not sharing resources directly, applications may share files or data through separate processes. For example, a note-taking app might sync with a cloud server in a separate process, using the same file.

The design of an application significantly affects how it interacts with the operating system and its performance. The applications discussed in this video likely differ from real-world examples but demonstrate similar principles for interacting with the OS.

Overall, understanding how different applications interact with the operating system is crucial for optimal performance and efficiency.

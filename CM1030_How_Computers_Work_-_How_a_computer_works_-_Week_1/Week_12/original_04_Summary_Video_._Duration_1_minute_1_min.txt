Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key You can be proud of yourself because you've started to get to grips with one of the most challenging topics in computer science. How multiple processors can run at the same time and interact with each other. You've seen how, from the very beginnings of computing, the functions of the operating system have really been about how to manage different computer programs that want to run on the same machine. At the beginning, this was in what's called the batch way, one program after another. But over time that turned into interactive processing where many different applications could be running simultaneously on a computer as they do now. You've seen how multiple processors can all share a single CPU by slicing up the time available and taking turns to run their program on it. You've heard how processors might have to wait for different resources. And can allow other processors to work while they're waiting, making multiprocessing surprisingly efficient. And you've also learned about some of the pitfalls of running multi processors. In particular, how they compete for resources and run into serious problems like deadlock. The ability to run multiple processors is one of the most fundamental functions of a modern operating system and also a really powerful part of competing. As you study more to become a computer scientist, you may well start liking programs that are able to run several processors in parallel which is a very difficult, but very important skill. But for now, you've learned enough to better understand what is happening in your computer, and the problems that can arise from having a lot of applications running. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 12.1 Inter-process Communication Lesson 12.2 Summary Peer-graded Assignment: Applications and operating systems .

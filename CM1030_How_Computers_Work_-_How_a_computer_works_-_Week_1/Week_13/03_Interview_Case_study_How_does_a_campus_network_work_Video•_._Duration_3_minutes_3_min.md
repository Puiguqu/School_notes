Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

The Goldsmiths campus has a single physical network that connects all desktop computers via Ethernet cables to switches, which are then connected to multiple switches around the campus, ultimately connecting to servers. However, the network is separated into separate Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) using virtual local area networks (VLANs). Each port within a switch can be configured to connect to a different VLAN, allowing separation of services and configuration of the network into segmented areas. Students can connect wirelessly with their own computers by logging in with their Goldsmiths username and password, accessing the Wi-Fi network, which is made up of wireless access points connected to the physical network through separate VLANs. The Goldsmiths network uses Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) for IP address assignment to computers that connect to the physical network. DHCP assigns an IP address within a set range from a DHCP server in response to a computer's request. Some machines may have static IP addresses, which remain unchanged and are useful for servers with fixed addresses. The Goldsmiths network connects to the Internet through the Joint Academic Network (JANET), a network connecting UK education institutions and research institutions. JANET provides internet access by connecting the Goldsmiths network to the wider Internet. The campus network is managed as a single, large physical network but functions within separate VLANs for different services and configurations. The use of VLANs allows for efficient management of the network and separation of services. The Goldsmiths network supports wireless connectivity with students' computers using their usernames and passwords to authenticate access to the Wi-Fi network. Understanding how networks work is crucial, especially in university or corporate settings where networking plays a vital role. Network architectures, including video networks and interview case studies, provide insights into different aspects of network functioning. Network protocols, like DHCP, are essential for managing and configuring the physical network, including IP address assignment to computers connecting to it. 

Note that I've kept the original structure and sentence structure as much as possible while condensing the information into a shorter summary. Let me know if you have any further requests!

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

1. Protocols are essential for network communication as they provide rules for computers to follow over networks.
2. Protocols prevent problems that can occur during network communications, such as messages being mixed up or transmitted at the same time.
3. Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) is a protocol implemented in the Ethernet standard to resolve collisions and ensure efficient transmission.
4. Messages are divided into packets, each containing message data and additional information, known as the packet header.
5. Protocols define the information contained within the packet header.
6. When sending a packet over the internet, it must use both the protocols of the physical network being used and the internet protocol (IP) protocol.
7. The IP packet is then encapsulated in another packet for the physical network being used, such as Wi-Fi or Ethernet.
8. Routers remove the IP packet from the physical network packet and re-encapsulate it with a new packet to be sent over the next network.
9. Data is typically transmitted using multiple layers of packets inside other packets, each based on a different protocol.
10. The innermost layer is normally the application layer, which includes protocols such as HTTP for web pages and POP/SMTP for email.
11. The transport layer handles communication between the start point and destination of a message, without worrying about content or networks.
12. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are two examples of transport layer protocols.
13. The network layer handles transmission across multiple networks, including routers, and is almost always implemented using IP protocol.
14. The link layer protocol handles transmission over a single physical network, such as Ethernet or Wi-Fi.
15. Network ports, which are numbers attached to packets, determine where the packet should be sent, allowing software to decide which application to use it with.

Note: I did not include some minor details and examples in this summary for brevity. Let me know if you need anything else!

Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key As we've seen in previous topics, a network is a collection of computers that are connected together so they can communicate. We've seen that there are different types of network based on how the computers are physically connected together. For example, Ethernet is a type of wired network where computers are connected with physical wires whereas in WiFi, computers are connected wirelessly using electromagnetic waves. But there are several other types of network depending not in the physical connections but how those connections are arranged. One way of classifying networks is by how large an area they cover. When you think of a network, you might think first of computers connected together in a single office or house. This kind of network is called, an LAN or LAN which stands for Local Area Network because it connects computers that are close together or local to one another. On the other hand, networks like the Internet can connect computers across the world, allowing me in London to communicate with people in Islamabad or Lagos. This kind of network is called a WAN or WAN which stands for Wide Area Network, because it connects computers over a much bigger or wider area than a LAN. But networks aren't just getting bigger, they're also getting smaller. While in the past people would typically have had just one computer that sat on their desk in their office, now, many people carries several digital devices with them at all times. For example, a mobile phone, a laptop, wireless headphones, and a smartwatch. These devices are often connected together in a many wireless network which is called a PAN or Personal Area Network. Another reason why computers are connected together, is so that they can work together. If you need a lot of computing power, for example, running very big scientific calculations or hosting a web server used by millions of people, it is often easier to use many computers together rather than buying one massively powerful computer. These computers are networked together and do their work in parallel, but they act to the outside world as if they were single computer. This type of combined computer is called a cluster. So, if someone tries to access a web server which is implemented as a cluster, they have no idea whether it's a single computer or many. Clusters have the benefit that they can combine the power of all the computers, but they are also more reliable than using just one machine. Because if one computer fails, the others can carry on without it. Networks can also be classified in terms of how the computers are connected together. For example, early networks often had one central computer that all the other computers connected to but they weren't connected to each other directly. This type of network is called a star. Star networks are still used for WiFi where all devices connect to a wireless access point, but they're less popular for other networks because they're very reliant on the main computer and the whole network fails if that fails. An alternative arrangement is to have all computers connected to a single long wire which is called a bus. The computers in the network are all independently connected to the bus and can communicate with all other computers on the bus without relying on the central computer. Ethernet, the most popular wide network architecture is a bus network. The bus is conceptually a long wire but in fact, it might be quite small. In most cases, the bus will actually be a hub which is a connective box like this one. Small Local Area Networks are connected to other networks to form wider area networks. They're connected by little computers that forward packets from one network to the other. They have different names depending on how sophisticated they are. Switches connect networks of the same type and typically forward packets unchanged. Routers on the other hand, connect different types of networks like Ethernet and WiFi and have to translate packets between different protocols. Routers form the basis of the Internet. Another possible classification for networks, is how the computers communicate with each other. The most common model is client-server communication in which individual computers called clients, all communicate with a central computer called a server. As we saw much earlier in this course, this is also how the web works. People download websites from the web server using their own devices which are called clients. Even if you're talking to friends on a social media platform like Facebook, you're actually communicating directly with the Facebook servers not your friends devices. Client-server looks very similar to a star network but they're actually doing very different things. A star network is about how computers are physically connected together. The wires or electromagnetic waves that allow them to communicate. Clients and servers are typically not directly connected to each other. They are connected in complex ways over the Internet. So, client-server communication isn't about physical connections but about virtual connections using network protocols. The alternative to client-server communication is peer to peer. This is where individual people's computers communicate directly with each other. This can seem a bit complicated but each type of network serves its own purpose. As you start to work with networks, you will understand the different needs of different situations. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 13.0 Introduction Lesson 13.1 Network architectures Video: Video Networks .

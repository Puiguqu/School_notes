Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key I'd like to welcome back Joe Hall, who is a system administrator here in the Department of Computing at Goldsmiths. Joe, can you tell us a little bit about the network we have here on the Goldsmiths campus? So all those desktop computers, like we have in this room, all connect via Ethernet cable to physical network ports. And then those network ports are connected back to switches, which then are connected to lots of switches around the campus. And then they're connected to the servers that are on campus, and so it sort of spreads out like that. >> So is it one big network or is it lots of little networks? >> It's one big physical network, there's no separation in terms of the physical structure. But what we actually have is separate VLANs, which are virtual local area networks, so within that one big network. Even within a single switch, each port within that switch can be configured to connect to a different virtual network. And this allows us to separate out things on the network into different functions. So for example, all the lab computers are on a separate VLAN, so all of the staff computers. They're all on separate VLAN, and then there are all these printers, they are on their own separate VLAN. And this allows just the separation of the services, and then you can configure those VLANs to talk to each other. Or not talk to each other in certain, so it allows a lot of configuration of the network into separate segmented areas. >> Okay, thank you, and can students connect wirelessly with their own computers, how does that work? >> Sure, we have a wireless network across the entire college, and students can log in. They have to authenticate that wireless network with their Goldsmiths's username and password. And when they log in to that network, yeah, then they have access to the Wi-Fi. And then that wireless network is made up of wireless access points which are all over campus. And those wireless access points connect back to the same physical network, but again they'll be separated out onto a separate VLAN. >> So one thing we've been learning about in this course, is IP addresses. How do computers get IP addresses on the Goldsmiths network? >> So in general we use DHCP, which is Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol. And what that means is a computer that connects the physical network. Will look for a DHCP server as part of the kind of built-in how Ethernet works on a machine. And then it will ask that DHCP server for an IP address, and then that server will respond to an IP address within a set range. So in the main, that's how we configure the computers to connect to the network. There are some examples whereby a machine will have a static IP address, one that never changes. And that's useful for things like servers which have to have a fixed address. >> Okay, thanks a lot, and how does the Goldsmiths network connect with the Internet as a whole? >> So we have a sort of ISP like everybody else, called JANET. And JANET is a network that connects all the education institutions and research institutions in the country, in the UK, together. >> And so we connect to that network and then we connect to the Internet through JANET. >> Okay well, thanks a lot Joe, that's been very helpful for our students. To understand better how a university or a general corporate network works. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 13.0 Introduction Lesson 13.1 Network architectures Video: Video Networks .

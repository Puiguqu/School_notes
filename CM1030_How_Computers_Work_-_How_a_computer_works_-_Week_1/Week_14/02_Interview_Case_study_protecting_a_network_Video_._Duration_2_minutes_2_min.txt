Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

The university network at Goldsmiths faces three main threats: unauthorized access by individuals inside or outside the network, as well as insider threats from employees or students accessing sites and the Internet. To mitigate these threats, the network employs a firewall to block harmful traffic. Firewalls can be used to prevent brute-force attacks, where attackers try to guess usernames and passwords to access servers. Automated systems are in place to identify and block IP addresses of individuals attempting such attacks.

Additionally, authentication is required for all machines connected to the network, which prevents unauthorized access by requiring a valid Goldsmiths username and password. Students learning about network security at Goldsmiths need to understand how the organization protects its networks from various threats.

The transcript also mentions that insider threats can compromise the network through authorized access, making it essential to implement robust authentication mechanisms. The university's firewall is designed to prevent unauthorized access, including brute-force attacks and other malicious activities. By understanding these security measures, students can better appreciate the importance of protecting their own networks in various contexts.

Overall, Goldsmiths has implemented a multi-layered approach to network security, which includes firewalls, authentication mechanisms, and automated systems to detect and block suspicious activity.

John, we've been learning about possible threats to networks in general. Can you tell us about the potential threats the university network like Goldsmiths faces. Especially, is kind of three main threats, those are people having access inside the network, to services, and people from outside the network trying to get into the network, and then also from people who work or study here at Goldsmiths accessing sites and the Internet, and then giving threats an avenue to get into the network direction. So, what kind of defenses does Goldsmiths put in place to stop that kind of threat? So, we will have a firewall in place, so if you are on the network on campus and you're accessing Internet, then firewall will block certain traffic that can be deemed harmful. Would you want to give it any particular examples of a threat that's, that happens at Goldsmiths? So, occasionally we'll have people try to brute force servers, which basically means, they try and guess the username and password to access the server. So, we have systems in place that identify if somebody's trying that technique from a certain location, and then we'll block their IP address for example. There's some automated systems in place to prevent that kind of attack. You also mentioned that there was threats from the inside people who are on the network, how do you protect against that? So, any machine that's on our network requires authentication. So, you need to login to that machine with a known username and password, that would have to be Goldsmiths username and password. So, with your lab machine-like in here or connecting to the wireless network, you have to authenticate to get onto the machine or onto the network. That prevents anybody who is trying to access the network, they won't be able to get beyond that step if they don't have the right authentication credentials. Okay. Well, great. Thanks for John. I think it's really valuable for students to understand a bit more about how you run and protect a network in an organization like Goldsmiths. Thanks a lot. You're welcome. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 14.1 Network security Discussion Prompt: How can malware compromise a network? .

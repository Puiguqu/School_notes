Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key This week's peer review activity is a bit different from previous peer reviews. In previous peer reviews you've applied your knowledge to understanding how particular applications, websites, or file formats work. This is a really important part of the learning for this course. And these kinds of questions form the basis of your coursework and will feature in your exam. But, the exam will also feature other types of questions. A lot of them will be multiple choice questions of the sort you've been doing throughout the course. But there will also be some long answer questions that are more factual than the peer review activities. They will test whether you know the basics of the course material. I believe that the course should prepare you for the exam. So you should practice doing these types of questions as well. This week's peer review exercise will let you practice those questions. If you want them to be a real practice for the exam, try to answer them without looking at your notes, the book, or the videos. Test if you really remember the material. You could always go back to the book afterwards to check that you've got the answer right. So have a go at the questions and get yourself ready for the exam. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 14.1 Network security Lesson 14.2 Summary Video: Video Introduction to peer review .

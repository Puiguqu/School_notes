Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key You now know about the different layers of protocols that make Internet communication possible. The link network and transport layers are all about getting packets from one end to another. The application layer on the other hand, is more about the content of the communication. What data is sent and how that data is used by your applications? The most obvious Internet application is maybe the World Wide Web using the HTTP protocol. But there are many different applications that use the Internet and they use a lots of different protocols. Let's have a look at some of those protocols. One of the most commonly used Internet applications is email, which uses different protocols from the web. When we use email, we think about it as a peer-to-peer protocol. We're sending messages directly to our friends. But in fact, email is a client server application. When you send an email, it first goes to your email server, which then sends it to your friends' email server and your friend downloads it from there. You can see the email server in an email address. The first part of an email address before the at sign is your identifier and name you have chosen. But the second part after the at sign is the domain name of your email server. Email involves a lot of different protocols. When email servers send email to each other, they use a protocol called Simple Mail Transfer Protocol or SMTP for short. This is a protocol for communication between servers. It's also used to send email from your computer to the server, but the email software on your computer or phones uses different protocols to fetch email from the server. There are two main protocols that clients used to fetch email from a server. POP and POP3 are designed for downloading email to your computer and storing it there, whereas IMAP stores email on the server, but lets you access it on your phone or computer. Microsoft also has its own proprietary set of protocols called Exchange. Nowadays, we often use webmail, which is email access to a web page, not an application on your computer. In this case, the protocol will be HTTP, the protocol of the web. This will let you view emails in a web page rather other than downloading the email itself. What about a truly peer-to-peer protocol? One Internet application where data is often sent in a peer-to-peer way is voice over IP, also called Internet telephony. This is where you have something like a telephone conversation by sending the sound of your voices over the Internet rather than traditional phone lines. Skype is perhaps the most famous voice over IP service. But a lot of what we think is ordinary phone conversations use voice over IP now. Early mobile phone protocols, you separate voice communication from Internet data, but the latest 4G protocol is just an Internet data protocol. Your phone conversations are sent using the Internet protocol. There are a lot of different voice over IP protocols. Each application has its own. But a lot of them appear to pair in the sense that voice data is sent from one client to another without using a server. But even peer-to-peer voice over IP still needs a server to connect people. When making an Internet phone call, your phone or computer will send a request to the voice over IP server for a connection with your friend. The server will then contact your friend's computer or phone to put the two of you into contact. Only when the contact has been established that does peer-to-peer communication begin. The World Wide Web is a classic client server protocol. The World Wide Web is about servers sending web pages to clients, your computer or phone. It uses the HTTP protocol or more commonly now the secure version HTTPS. That involves a client sending a request for a web page using an HTTP request to the server, which creates the page and sends it back. I shown an HTTP request using an easy to read web address like this one. It's called the Universal Resource Locator or URL. But as you learned earlier in the course, the Internet protocols do not understand URLs. They use numerical addresses like this one, which is called an IP address. The URL contains a lot of different bits of information that are used to fetch web pages, but this middle part is the address of a web server, which your computer needs in order to contact the server. This readable form of the address is called a domain name. It's easy to understand for us, but not for network protocols. So, it needs to be converted into an IP address. This conversion is done by yet another protocol called Domain Name System or DNS. A DNS server is a server that knows how to convert domain names into IP addresses. To find out the IP address of the domain you want to use, your client sends a request to the DNS server, which sends back an IP address, which your computer can use an HTTP request to the server. DNS is vital to almost all Internet communication. So, most applications will use DNS first to get hold of an IP address before starting the main communication, whether it's an email, voice over IP or HTTP. It's a very simple protocol involving a single request and reply. That means it doesn't need to use the full reliable channels setup by TCP. It only involves two messages and if your clients doesn't get a reply, it knows that something is wrong. That's why it's an example of an application protocol that uses UDP in the transport layer. So, you have now seen some of the many application layer protocols used in Internet communication, and there are many, many more. For the rest of this topic, we will focus on one of these, HTTP and the World Wide Web. As it's perhaps the most commonly used application layer protocol of all. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 15.0 Introduction Lesson 15.1 The internet Practice Assignment: How does email work? .

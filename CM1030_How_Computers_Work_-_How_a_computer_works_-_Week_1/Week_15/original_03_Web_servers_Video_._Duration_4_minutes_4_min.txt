## VIDEO TRANSCRIPT ## You may navigate through the transcript using tab. To save a note for a section of text press CTRL + S. To expand your selection you may use CTRL + arrow key. You may contract your selection using shift + CTRL + arrow key. For screen readers that are incompatible with using arrow keys for shortcuts, you can replace them with the H J K L keys. Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key You've already seen that the web and the HTTP protocol are about sending information between clients and servers. Clients send requests to servers and servers send web pages back, using a file format called HTML, the file formats of the web. But how do clients and servers actually work? How are web pages is created? In the early days of the web, things were quite simple. A URL might look like this. This URL refers to an actual file in a file system. The part of the URL after the domain name contains the folder that contains the HTML file. The last part of the URL is the name of the file itself. The server looks up the file and sends it to the client. Some websites still work this way but most are more complex. Earlier in this course, you learned how most web pages are created just for you at the time of your request, by combining a template with data from a database. For example, the page you're watching this video on, isn't stored on the server. It's created based on the information about this course and your progress through it. I'll come back to what happens if you're watching on an app. It isn't too different. The template will provide the basic layout and formatting of the page, like the header bar and menus. This will be the same for all lessons and courses. The detailed information relevant to a particular course and video would mostly be in the database. For example, the title of the video. But not everything is stored in a database. Databases are typically designed to store numbers and small amounts of data. They're no good for storing large amounts of data like a video. For this reason, a lot of the data like images, audio and video are typically stored as separate files called assets. So, on the page you're watching the video will be an asset and only the name of the asset file will be stored in the database. Let's look at an example of a database driven website. This part of the URL still refers to a file. But it isn't an HTML file that's sent to a client. It's a script, a small computer program that creates an HTML file. In this case, it's written in the popular web programming language PHP. This final part of the URL is what we call the arguments to the script. They control aspects of how the script works. In this case, the script is a generic lesson script that can generate any lesson page and the argument tells it to generate less than one. The PHP file contains instructions to fetch data from a database and combine them with an HTML template. In the case of PHP, the template is stored in the same file as a script. The PHP script combines these together to create an HTML file that's sent to the client. But even this is a lot simpler than how a lot of modern websites work. You might see URLs look like this. Notice that there isn't a file name with a file extension in this URL. This is because it doesn't refer to an actual file at all. A lot of modern websites don't use the file system at all. Instead of using the URL to find a file, they use a piece of software called a routing engine to interpret the URL and work out what web page to generate. All elements of the URL after the domain name essentially become arguments to a single routing scripts. The word routing is the same one used for sending traffic over the internet. The concept is related but a bit different. Routing in the Internet is about working out which route to take from one computer to another. Routing on a web server is working out which bit of the server program to use to generate a web page. The router will work out based on the URL, which data from a database and which template to use to generate the web page. The data and template will be combined by a templating engine, which is often separate from the router and they're used to create the web page. The web page is sent back to your client and you get to see it in your browser. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 15.0 Introduction Lesson 15.1 The internet Lesson 15.2 The web Video: Video Web servers .

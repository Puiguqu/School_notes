I'd like to welcome back Dr. Matthew Yee-King who the last time you met in his course was talking about his work in music, but he's also a very good web programmer. So I'd like to ask him a little bit about the trends in current web programming. Now Matthew, we've been talking a little bit about databases in this course and the relation of database model which is the standard model of databases that have been used for many many years. But recently a lot of the cutting edge web programming has used a slightly different approach called NoSQL. Can you tell us a little bit about what NoSQL databases are? Yes. So if we start with what SQL databases are, there very much have this tabular structure much like a spreadsheet where you've got tables of rows and columns. NoSQL allows you to escape from that model and have all wonderful different types of data structures in your database. So for example, you might want to store a hierarchical structure where you have things inside other things rather than the flat structure where you've always got lists of things. So that's one model. Another model is actually storing graph structures where you've got things connected to other things in different types of structures. Those possibilities are what NoSQL opens up to us. Okay. Can you tell us a little bit about a common example of a NoSQL database and how that stores data? Yes. So a database I work with quite regularly is the MongoDB, and that is what we call a document storage database. That's very much looking at storing structured documents typically in JSON format. So unlike an SQL database where as I said a flat rows and columns structure, it's a hierarchical structure where for example, let's say you had a data model to represent a book in a bookstore, you could have the title of the book, and you could have the date when the book was published which is how you do it in SQL, but then also you could have a whole substructure which would tell you a little about the author of the book and maybe even another substructure which tells you about all the people that have bought the book, or the reviews for the book and that can all be stored in a single item in the database. So how is Mongo and NoSQL databases being used in practice, who's using them? Well, one of the more common forms of database that's used in modern web development. People still use SQL databases because they're very efficient and certainly on storage and filtering and such. But yeah, they are very widely used and they store a model of the data which is closer to the model that is actually getting used in the application layer. So what are the big advantages of a NoSQL database over an SQL database? So the advantages are that you can store much more varied forms of data. So you're not restricted by this flat columns and rows model. You can as I mentioned earlier, you can have structured documents, you can have graphs and so on. Also, I guess they're very much, certainly a lot of people use them to just throw stuff in and it's like dustbin of data. So you just chuck in whatever structure you want and they don't impose necessarily a schema on your data. So you don't have to define what kind of data you want to store before you store it unlike an SQL database. Okay. So are there any disadvantages? Are there any reasons for sticking with SQL? Yes. So SQL because it has this very fixed structure and well-defined structure, it means that it can be more efficient to use. So searching through tables which are flat is quite efficient whereas if you have any arbitrary structure of document in there when you're accessing that data, you can't assume that it has any particular structure. So there's a different approach to working with these models where you work more with filters that you apply to documents which again are in themselves can be hierarchical structures. So it demands a whole different model of searching and indexing as well. So yeah, it's a more complicated if you like to sort data that you're working with. So you have to have more complicated ways of searching and finding what you need in there. You mentioned that you've used it in your work, could you tell us some examples of projects you've used NoSQL databases for? Yes. So I've built a multiple choice questioning survey engine recently for gathering some student feedback, and that engine I was able to store the complete description of a survey in there. So all the questions and all the available answers all in one document that was much easier to work with than having that information spread across several tables, and every time I wanted to run the survey having to pull all the information together and construct it into the model I needed. I could just store the model that I needed directly in the database and that made it much easier to work with that data. Okay. Well great. Thanks a lot, Matthew. It's good to hear about NoSQL databases. I think relational database models are still really important and SQL is still key to databases but it's also a very good to note about more recent cutting edge approaches that are also being very extensively used in industry. So thank you, Matthew. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 16.1 Databases Discussion Prompt: Data about this course .

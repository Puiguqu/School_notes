Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Artificial intelligence (AI) aims to create machines that can replicate human intelligence to perform tasks humans can do but have historically been difficult for machines. The Turing test, invented by Alan Turing, is a measure of AI's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human. However, the test has flaws, as many systems use simple tricks to fool people rather than showing true intelligence. AI has split into various subfields, including computer vision, natural language processing, robotics, and computational creativity.

These subfields have led to significant advancements in tasks such as image recognition, language understanding, and robot manipulation. However, most of these achievements are considered "narrow" or task-specific AI, lacking the general intelligence humans possess. Achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI), which is the ability to perform any intellectual task, remains an open problem.

AI systems have employed various techniques, including logical rules and expert systems, but often struggle with uncertainty and complexity. Machine learning, a different approach, has become widely used, relying on algorithms that enable machines to learn from data and improve their performance over time. Despite this, creating expert systems for tasks like face recognition remains challenging due to the lack of clear rules and understanding of human cognition.

The field of AI continues to evolve, with ongoing research and development aimed at improving its capabilities and addressing its limitations. As AI advances, it is likely to have a significant impact on various industries and aspects of life.

There is no text provided for me to summarize. The text appears to be a table of contents or a list of materials from a computer science textbook, specifically Chapter 11 Artificial Intelligence and Section 11.5 on artificial neural networks. It includes various videos, reading materials, practice assignments, and discussion prompts.

If you could provide the actual text, I would be happy to summarize it for you in 15 sentences, focusing on the most important concepts and findings, as well as key information, formulae, and technical details.

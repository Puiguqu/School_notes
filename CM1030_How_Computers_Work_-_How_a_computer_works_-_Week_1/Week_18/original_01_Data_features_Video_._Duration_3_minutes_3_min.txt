Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key How does a computer see an image? We saw that a machine-learning model takes an input and gives an output. We've talked about the input being an image, but we've also seen that the input is always just a bunch of numbers. That's powerful because it means that we can apply machine learning to anything that we can represent as numbers. But it doesn't mean that we have to find a good way of representing things as numbers, including representing images as numbers. We've also seen how we normally represent images on a computer. An image is a grid of pixels, and each pixel is represented as numbers that represent colors. So, that could be a good input to machine learning but there are problems with it. Small changes to an image that we wouldn't even recognize as a real change can have a big impact on pixel values. A small change in lighting can have big effects that we don't recognize because we're used to seeing objects under different lighting conditions. Also, shifting the whole image even a couple of pixels to the right, can completely change the value of a particular pixel, even though the image looks the same to us. This means that low pixel values can be a bad representation of an image for machine learning. We need a better way of representing images as numbers. In machine learning we use the nine features for the numbers we use to represent things. Pixels are an example of a feature for images. They are what we call a low-level or raw data feature that represent the image as it is, but individual pixels don't carry much meaningful information. If instead of using images of cats and dogs, we took measurements of things like nose length, weight and first color. These will be higher level more meaningful features which might work better for machine learning. The features we choose can have a big effect on learning. It'll be possible to learn something using certain features but it might be impossible to learn the same thing using other features. If all we have is fur color, it'll be very hard to learn the difference between cats and dogs. Most domains have many different possible features. For example, a sound signal is a low-level feature for both music and human language. But both have high level meaningful features like musical lights or written words. Machine learning is likely to work better with these high level features. But there are also many situations where we'd like to work directly with a raw data like images. Luckily, it's possible to automatically calculate some features that are more meaningful than pixels from the raw pixel data. For example, edges between patches of color are often a good feature, and they can be calculated using the kind of filter that you might be familiar with from a photo editing software like Photoshop. Some applications have even more specialized features. Many face recognition systems have special code to recognize the eyes or the edges of the mouth. So, an important part of the process of machine learning is feature extraction. Extracting more meaningful features from the raw data. This generally means writing some custom code to calculate these features, but as we'll see, it's now increasingly possible to learn the features themselves. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 18.1 Data features Discussion Prompt: Data features .

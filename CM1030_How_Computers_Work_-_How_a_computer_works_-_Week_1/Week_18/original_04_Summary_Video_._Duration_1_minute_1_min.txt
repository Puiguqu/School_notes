Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key Well done. You've done your first machine learning. You've learned the basics of what machine learning is, how machines can learn the tasks from example data. You've seen a little about how it's possible for a relatively simple computer algorithm to learn complex tasks from data. We've also learned a bit about the kinds of tasks that machine learning algorithms can do, mapping inputs to outputs, but most importantly, you've actually tried machine learning yourself. You've trained the model by giving it examples. It's one thing to hear about machine learning and the amazing things it can do, but it's really hard to understand that without trying it for yourself. By doing it yourself, you should have got a sense of how it works, and just as importantly, the ways in which it doesn't work. Machine learning is a really exciting technology that's revolutionizing how computers work and what they can do. You've taken your first steps in being part of that revolution, and taking your part in the future of computer science. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 18.1 Data features Lesson 18.2 Summary Discussion Prompt: A machine learning application .

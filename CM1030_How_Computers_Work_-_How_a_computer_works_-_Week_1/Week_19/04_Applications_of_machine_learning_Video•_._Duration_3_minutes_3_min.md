Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Machine learning has achieved significant success in real-world applications beyond laboratory settings. One notable example is image recognition technology used in smartphones, such as Apple's Photos app, which relies on face recognition to search for photos. The Google Engine also heavily relies on machine learning to provide good results. Additionally, machine learning has enabled automatic translation software, with early datasets like the Canadian Parliament proceedings being used to train translation models.

Speech recognition technology, such as Amazon Alexa and Apple Siri, is another impressive application of machine learning. This technology uses large amounts of recorded voice data to understand user queries and provide accurate responses. Online shopping also utilizes machine learning for product recommendations, leveraging hundreds of millions of customers' data to make personalized suggestions.

A key characteristic of modern machine learning is the amount of data used; companies with vast amounts of data, such as Amazon, Facebook, and Google, can utilize it most effectively. The growth of internet data is likely to fuel new breakthroughs in machine learning applications. Some potential areas include automatic medical diagnosis from radiology scans and computers that can write news articles.

Self-driving cars also rely on machine learning, particularly image recognition technology to detect objects such as other cars, bicycles, pedestrians, and road signs. This application of machine learning is based on the same techniques used in previous courses. The development of self-driving cars has advanced significantly, with a full trial taking place near London recently.

Overall, machine learning has become an essential tool for various applications, from image recognition to speech recognition, and its potential continues to grow as more data becomes available.

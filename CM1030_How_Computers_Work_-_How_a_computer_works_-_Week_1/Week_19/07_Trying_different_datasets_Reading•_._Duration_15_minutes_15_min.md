Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving all key information, formulae, and technical details:

The next exercise will involve practicing machine learning with example datasets. To do this, you need to train and test by loading images from a file instead of a video. You can switch from video to file by clicking the upload button to load files for a particular class. Once loaded, you can click "Load an image to classify" to load a new test image to classify.

Each zip file contains folders "Train" with training data and "Test" with testing data. Each folder has sub-folders for each class. To train and test, you need to load the training data into the training set and then classify each image in the testing set.

The goal is to see how many images can be correctly classified and understand why some work better than others. You will likely find that some examples are more difficult to classify than others. Analyzing these results can help you identify areas for improvement and suggest ways to improve the results.

Unfortunately, there is no further information provided in the text about specific datasets, training methods, or classification algorithms. However, it is clear that the exercise involves practical experience with machine learning and image classification.

## VIDEO TRANSCRIPT ## You may navigate through the transcript using tab. To save a note for a section of text press CTRL + S. To expand your selection you may use CTRL + arrow key. You may contract your selection using shift + CTRL + arrow key. For screen readers that are incompatible with using arrow keys for shortcuts, you can replace them with the H J K L keys. Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key The reason a lot of people are now excited about machine learning, is that it's having massive success outside of the lab in real world applications that we use all the time. In this course, we've looked mostly at image recognition, a technology that is starting to be used to search for images. The iPhones photos app allows you to search for your photos for particular people, a technology that relies on face recognition using machine learning. You can actually help train the system yourself by labeling photos with the correct names. But machine learning isn't just about images. It can be applied to many other types of data. One of the most successful uses of machine learning concerns language, both written text and speech. The Google Engine relies very heavily on machine learning on the text of webpages to give you good results. Machine learning has also enabled the current generation of automatic translation software, which is now very good because it's been trained on data sets of the same text translated into two or more languages. The proceedings of the Canadian Parliament, which were available in both English and French, are an early example of a dataset that was used to train translation software. One of the most impressive uses a machine learning on language has been speech recognition, of the sort that you can see an automatic assistance like Amazon Alexa or Apple Siri. The fact that the computer can understand your question and come up with the correct answer, is pretty astounding and it's all down to machine learning on large amounts of recorded voice data. You're also likely to encounter machine learning if you do online shopping. The product recommendation that sites like Amazon give you are chosen using machine learning. If Amazon's recommendation seem uncannily accurate, it's because it's learned from it's hundreds of millions of customers. That's one of the characteristics of modern machine learning. You've learned in this course, that machine learning works better the more data you have. So, the companies that can use it most effectively, are those with the most data, like Amazon with its millions of customers, Facebook with its billions of users, and Google with essentially the entire internet. The vast amounts of data we're producing on the internet are likely to fuel new amazing breakthroughs that apply machine learning to new areas. Some of the ones that seem possible in the next few years include Automatic Medical Diagnosis from radiology scans, and computers that can write news articles, something that's already being done for sports and financial news. Self-driving cars are another machine learning innovation. Something that would have seemed like science fiction even a few years ago, but they had a full trial near us in London a few months before filming this video. One of the hardest things about self-driving cars, is recognizing what's on the ride around the car, whether it's other cars, bicycles, pedestrians or road signs. This means that a large part of self-driving car technology concerns image recognition. Even though it seems like amazingly advanced technology, it's based on the same types of machine learning techniques that you've been using throughout this course. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 19.0 Introduction Lesson 19.1 Testing Lesson 19.2 Societal Impact of Machine Learning Video: Video Applications of machine learning .

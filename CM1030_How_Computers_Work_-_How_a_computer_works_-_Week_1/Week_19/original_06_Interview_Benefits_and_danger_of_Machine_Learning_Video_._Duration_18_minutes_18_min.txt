I'd like to ask our panel of experts, how can machine learning improve our lives? What are the big benefits that machine learning can bring us? Rebecca. Well, I've spent a lot of the last 10 years as a researcher building tools for other people to apply machine learning to problems that might benefit them, and so this is something that I think about a lot. Certainly, the range of applications where machine learning is useful is huge. I tend to focus mainly on applications that have to do with accessibility, building systems for people with disabilities and/or systems for creativity, enabling new types of music or art or interaction. In those domains, machine learning bring some really tangible exciting benefits. So first of all, there's a lot of data that people in those domains may want to take advantage of that is just really hard or impossible to do without machine learning. So if you have data with many features, for instance, if you're dealing with audio or video or certain sensors, it can just be cumbersome or impossible to make sense of that data even if you're an expert programmer. So machine learning allows people to build models of that data, and then use those models to either say something useful about what's happening in the world around them or to drive computer systems that respond to the world in certain ways. So this could mean making new musical instruments that respond to people's gestures, it could mean making responsive art installations that look at what people are doing in a room and move robotic sculptures in response. It can mean making new kinds of video games that respond to maybe how somebody's moving with controllers, or even how the social interaction unfolds between different characters in a game. So all these things are exciting, but might just be hard without machine learning. But there are other benefits as well, particularly in the space of creativity and design. So for one thing, building things with machine learning is often much more accessible to more people than programming. So if you can come up with some examples of a thing that a person might do, and labels that describe that action or computer responses that you might want to be triggered by that action, if you can come up with that dataset and use an appropriate machine learning tool to build a model of that relationship, then certainly you don't have to be a programmer. So this enables people who aren't programmers to actually build quite sophisticated systems themselves. Sometimes this means designers in an organization can build prototypes rather than relying on a tech team. Also, it means that kids can build things for themselves and for others. So that's exciting. Then the third thing that I'll add is that, machine learning gives us an alternative way to express embodied interactions or expressive interactions to a computer. So it can be really hard for us to even as people speaking our native language, describe how a dancer is moving or describe how we play an instrument, or how we ride a bicycle, but it's quite natural for us to demonstrate that. So by using machine learning, we can make it much more effective for people to build computer systems that understand something about how humans are acting as people with bodies that do all sorts of complicated things in the world. That's great. I mean, I think machine learning has this reputation of being this very technical subject just for engineers, but actually you're right. What we're trying to do with this course as well is to show that it can be a technology that everybody can use with their own embodied physical skills. Larisa what about you, what do you see this benefits? I see as the main benefit of machine learning in supporting humans to process this huge amount of information we are facing. So we no longer can read all articles that are published, we no longer can analyze the sensor datas that are coming, that is why there are so many applications where you rely on the computers to process it. So there is no denial that computers are better in many things. So they can do things in parallel, in multi-dimensional, there's thousands of huge features. So humans just cannot do it. It's already multi-billion industry. The [inaudible] said that it will be only expanding. What we are witnesses now, it's very profound. So the nature of our jobs is changing, the nature just how we're interacting with the world is changing. Yes, it is exciting and it's great opportunity to know more about it, but also we can direct which way it goes. So that would be my answer. Okay. Jamie. Well, I guess two answers to that that reflect on both of what you have said there, both of you. From a slightly smaller scale, my own research and wearable computing, I mean, a small goal there is to be able to build computers that help us do daily things, every day daily things, and that can be an accessibility aid. If you are physically unable to do some of these things or you need some assistance with that, the computer can help you. With it being able to understand your movements, your actions, this embodied connection, if a computer is able to sense understand that and I see understand is able to recognize that, use machine learning to then analyze it and then act on that to help us, I think there's a whole range of applications there that are very, very interesting. One of the areas I work in is with autism, where social behavior between say all these autistic children is thought to have certain issues, certain difficulties. What we found using wearable sensing was there were social behaviors happening that non-autistic people couldn't see. But the autistic people themself, were able to engage with. We were able to find that using machine learning and sensing, but not noise as casual observers. So there's a lot of very interesting useful areas in that topic that drive me. But on a grander scale, a major scale, I mean, there isn't an area of life where machine learning doesn't have a profound influence and impact, for the positive and the negative. Just to pick one example, I think that diagnosis of serious illness. For example in cancer diagnosis, has just taken a massive leap forward. When you're able to train an algorithm to spot cancerous cells so much quicker, so much more efficient, so much easier than a physician having to look at lots and lots of scans. So I think there are so many areas where there's really genuine positive impact of machine learning. Thanks, Jamie. You also mentioned some of the negative. Yes. I mean, there's a lot of anxiety about machine learning and AI at the moment. What do you think of the potential dangers of this technology? As much as the benefits, there are negatives and probably more, and we have to be aware of them. I think as engineers and computer scientists, we really need to be aware of them because there are things we can influence and have a say in. One of the big things in any discipline is assumptions. If you make assumptions about things, you're destined to failure. But we need to make assumptions, otherwise we'll never progress. With machine learning, there's a lot of assumptions. We've even made some of them today. I make them all the time where we're like, "Oh, we don't know how to choose which features or which algorithms we're going to use. We'll just throw lots of machine learning at it, learn from the data, and that it'll find the best solution." But those are big assumption. Because the minute you take the human out of the loop and just leave it all to the machine learning and have no human in there, no brain in there, then we start opening ourselves up to all sorts of biases in the data, and lots of manipulation of the data that can then influence the algorithms. You can certainly look into these instances where advanced machine learning algorithms have started expressing racist decisions based on taking data from the Internet, which in itself was racist. But for me, the biggest issue at the moment with machine learning which we really need to think about, it comes back to this idea of efficiency and energy usage.There's a trend in machine learning to solve every problem using deep learning. Let's get some deep learning or not. solution, massive neural networks, and have lots and lots of computing power to solve the problem. Sometimes that's solution could be just a simple linear regression, and we have just spent lots and lots of energy trying to solve that problem. No, that seems fine for a bunch of computer scientists in a lab. But if it's got half the world using machine learning algorithms, then we start to have significant impact on our energy infrastructure. A recent study showed that some natural language processing algorithms, just to train the model they used as much energy as several transatlantic flights. Before too, already, for example, certain computing technologies already use more energy than some countries. So we are on the verge of machine learning becoming one of the biggest users of vital natural resources on the planet, and we really need to do something about that. So that's quite a critical thing I think, which as engineers and scientists we need to think about. Thank you. Larisa, your thoughts on the dangers. I think like this in a technology, it's all about how you use it. Electricity, huge benefits. But if you don't use it properly, you can kill yourself. So this is the same. You have to use this powerful technology responsible. Unfortunately, people who are working, developing these technologies, they are focused too much on technology per se. I can see how it can happen. It happened to me. It's so beautiful, so logical, so organized, so powerful, and you think that someone else will take care how it is used, or ethical aspects. Unfortunately, legislation, regulation, people who's supposed to do it or they don't understand fully what these components, they're not specialist, or it's so lagged behind. So yes. The power unleashed and it's sometimes wild. We need to think about it. One of hot topics for discussion that's how they targets that people didn't volunteer to the needs is data. Data can reflect some racist point of view so how to stop it, how to control it. So there are many dangers. Another hot topic is will all see machine learning algorithms take jobs. It's very important to analyze how it will change the structure of job market. Our everyday life, our social interactions. But I think what's happening now is extremes. So wonderful it will solve all problems or it's awful it will kills us all. The reality is somewhere in between and we all can make a difference. So yes we are saying technologies are good and bad and we can make all the difference. Rebecca, where was duality we where would. I think I agree with everything that Jamie and Elisa raised. I think I'm not going to repeat their points, but I have a few thoughts to add. So another one of the challenges that I think about a lot what I'm trying to help. People who are in need use Machine Learning effectively whether they're students or whether they're professionals in some domain, it can be really hard to connect these decision-making algorithms for instance to the human contexts in which they're meant to be used. So in the human-computer interaction community, sometimes the term for this as you know is human-centered Machine Learning we you and I worked on a a journal issue around this theme. I think there are people in domains from the arts to medicine trying to grapple with these questions about algorithm is being used to do something like medical diagnosis for instance, but it can be very hard to understand why it's making certain predictions. The solutions to that aren't clear. There's even some research suggesting that well if you take a decision-making algorithm and you constructed so that it gives an explanation to the end users so the user has some rationale for why that decision was made. People can be more likely to trust a bad decision because they don't question the rationale of that decision in the same way. So there's a whole bunch of questions there about how we really designed these systems from the beginning to fit into human processes in ways that give us the desired outcome that don't make us either completely reliant on questionable processes or remove the benefits of potentially integrating that data-driven approach to decision-making into different applications. So that's one thing that I think about a lot. Another thing that I think about a lot in the creative context is the ethics around where data comes from. So there are a lot of really fantastic interesting art and music projects happening right now, where if you can train a generative Machine Learning algorithm not to do necessarily classification or regression, but something that for instance you could train on a set of thousands of songs and use that model that gets built of those songs to generate new songs. Is that really yours? Do you own those new songs? What about all the people who composed the songs that you trained on? Should you be crediting them in some way? Should you be compensating them? This technology is really taken off without much regard to how we ethically approach that, and the norm right now is that people just take whatever data they can get and don't credit or compensate people and that seems very problematic to me. So there's certainly discussions happening around both the ethics and the possible technical solutions to addressing that, but we're a ways away from having any consensus about what that looks like. The last thing that I want to quickly mention is that there are some really interesting challenges around the use of Machine Learning in human contexts, that don't even necessarily stem from the fact that we're using intelligent algorithms, but rather the propensity for people to either, as you mentioned totally trust or totally mistrust technology. One of the books that I recommend to students often it's a book called Weapons of Math Destruction by Cathy O'Neil. In this book, she talks about how we as humans have used algorithms to support or replace human decision-making and some of the really scary upsetting consequences that can bring whether or not those are Machine Learning algorithms are just something that a programming firm put together. I always encourage people to be skeptical about whether we're using algorithms to do things that might be better off done by people or might be better off done in collaboration between people and machines. Of course, the first step to getting people to be skeptical about that is also getting people to realize that Machine Learning has all of these potential pitfalls and complexities and it's not magic and it's certainly not always going to be right. We have to figure out how to deal with that. Thank you. That's absolutely right. To bring back to your original point. I think we have a responsibility to try and make sure that we're getting the benefits of Machine Learning. The world gets the benefits of Machine Learning without so much of the dangers. I think the idea of explainable Machine Learning that can explain why it's doing it. So we don't have to trust it, so we don't have to take it that the set of our core is really beneficial. But I almost want to draw attention to Rebecca's first point which is that the importance of looking at the human context of Machine Learning and the many different kinds of people, the many different kinds of academic backgrounds or social backgrounds that can contribute to understanding Machine Learning and making sure Machine Learning is doing the right thing for people, and it is not just something for engineers to look at it as a small technical problem, but it's something to look at the social context of everybody who interacts with technology. That's why I really want to thank you, the learners for taking this course, where you're maybe not coming in with a lot of computer science background, but where you can start to take part in the conversation about what Machine Learning is, what it's used for, and how it can benefit humanity. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 19.0 Introduction Lesson 19.1 Testing Lesson 19.2 Societal Impact of Machine Learning Video: Video Applications of machine learning .

# An e-commerce site Videoâ€¢ . Duration: 4 minutes 4 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-how-computers-work/lecture/IjLKa/an-e-commerce-site)

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, focusing on key concepts and findings:

An e-commerce website operates using states, which represent different stages of the user's interaction with the site. The first state is typically the default homepage, where users search for products. This transition to the second state, the search page, involves a change in data stored by the website about the user. Clicking on a product leads to a third state, examining the product details. Adding a product to the shopping cart represents another state change. The shopping cart is often conditional, requiring users to be logged in to proceed. Logging in itself constitutes a separate state, and completing it allows access to the shopping cart. Progressing through states involves entering payment details and choosing delivery options. Each of these steps represents a distinct state, with transitions triggered by user input or server-side transactions. The checkout process is characterized by multiple states, including entering an address, credit card information, and delivery method. Once the payment has been processed, the website confirms the purchase in its final state. In computer science, states are often used to model the behavior of software systems, with each state representing a specific condition or action. The concept of states is fundamental to understanding how computer programs work, particularly those that involve user input and data processing. By analyzing states in software systems, developers can identify inefficiencies and improve system performance. The use of states allows for more modular and maintainable code, as each stage of the program can be treated independently.

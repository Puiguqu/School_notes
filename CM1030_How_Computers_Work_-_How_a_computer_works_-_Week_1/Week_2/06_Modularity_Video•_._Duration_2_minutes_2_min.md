Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Modularity is a fundamental concept in computer science based on abstraction, which allows complex systems to be understood and built by breaking them down into smaller, independent modules. Computer systems are composed of multiple components, such as CPU, memory, hard disks, and displays, which can be split into modules to improve manageability. Software development also employs modularity, where existing elements from operating systems, open-source software, or other developers are utilized to create complex software. A key example of a module is a hardware driver, which interacts with specific hardware components, such as printers or sound cards.

To simplify the development process, drivers are independent of applications and can interact with different hardware components in a consistent manner. This allows application developers to write code that interacts with drivers, while hardware developers only need to write one driver for each hardware component. The benefits of modularity include reduced work for software development and improved compatibility with new hardware releases.

Modularity is essential for understanding software, as it helps identify the individual modules that make up a piece of software. By analyzing these components, developers can improve their notional machine skills and better comprehend complex software systems. Understanding modularity also enables developers to debug and troubleshoot issues more effectively.

In addition to its benefits for software development, modularity is also important in understanding how applications interact with hardware components. The use of drivers and modules allows applications to access various hardware features without requiring customized code for each component. This enables applications to function consistently across different hardware platforms.

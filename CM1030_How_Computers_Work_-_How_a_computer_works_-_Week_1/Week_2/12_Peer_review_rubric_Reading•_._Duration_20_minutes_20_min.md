It appears that you have provided a rubric for assessing the quality of student responses in a computer science course. The rubric has four criteria:

1. **The work describes computer science concepts for this week**
	* No: The response does not describe the relevant concepts.
	* Yes, but: The response contains some mistakes or unclear points.
	* Yes: The response accurately describes the relevant concepts.
	* Yes, and: The response also includes new ideas or perspectives not taught in class.
	* Wow!: The response exceeds expectations by providing a deep understanding of the concepts beyond what was taught in class.
2. **The work illustrates these ideas with an example**
	* No: The response does not provide an example to illustrate the concepts.
	* Yes, but: The response contains some mistakes or unclear points in the example.
	* Yes: The response provides a clear and accurate example that illustrates the concepts.
	* Yes, and: The response also includes new ideas or perspectives not taught in class through the example.
	* Wow!: The response exceeds expectations by providing an innovative and insightful example that goes beyond what was taught in class.
3. **The work explains how the computer system works**
	* No: The response does not explain how the computer system works.
	* Yes, but: The response contains some mistakes or unclear points in the explanation.
	* Yes: The response provides a clear and accurate explanation of how the computer system works.
	* Yes, and: The response also includes new ideas or perspectives not taught in class through the explanation.
	* Wow!: The response exceeds expectations by providing a detailed and insightful explanation that goes beyond what was taught in class.
4. **The work predicts how different technical choices or situations would affect a system**
	* No: The response does not make predictions about how different technical choices or situations would affect a system.
	* Yes, but: The response contains some mistakes or unclear points in the prediction.
	* Yes: The response provides a clear and accurate prediction of how different technical choices or situations would affect a system.
	* Yes, and: The response also includes new ideas or perspectives not taught in class through the prediction.
	* Wow!: The response exceeds expectations by providing a detailed and insightful prediction that goes beyond what was taught in class.

Overall, this rubric provides a clear and structured framework for assessing student responses, with four levels of evaluation (No, Yes, Yes, and Wow!) to help instructors gauge the quality of student work.

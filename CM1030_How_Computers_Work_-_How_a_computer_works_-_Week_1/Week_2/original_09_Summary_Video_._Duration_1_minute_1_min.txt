Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key Congratulations, you've already learned a lot of computer science. You've learned how we use abstraction to understand complex computer systems. You've learned how software has states that affect its behaviour, and how it's split into components called modules. Using a quiz, you've tested yourselves on one of the most important skills of a computer scientist, debugging. You've also applied these ideas to understanding a lot of real computing systems like the CPU and memory that make up the core of computer hardware, and lots of elements of software. You've seen how online shopping involves states and so do files and word processors. You've also seen how applications are modular that comprise the many complex elements that interact. These basic ideas can also be applied to many other aspects of computers, for example, the Internet which we'll look at next. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 2.1 State Lesson 2.2 Modularity and applications Lesson 2.3 Summary Reading: Reading Peer review rubric .

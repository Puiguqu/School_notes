You've gathered the data set, trained your model and tested it. You've learned a bit more about the amazing things that Machine Learning can do. You've probably learned about the ways Machine Learning could go wrong and what makes it hard. You've had your first starts in one of the most exciting emerging areas of Computer Science, one that's likely to shape the future of computing technology. What you do next is up to you. Maybe you simply see Machine Learning as part of your broader career in computer science. You might not need to go into so much depth in Machine Learning, but collecting data and training models is still likely be part of what you do, or maybe your experience with Machine Learning will simply help you better understand the various computer systems that you interact with and use Machine Learning models, everything from shopping recommendations to medical diagnosis. In any case, you've taken your first steps into the future of Computer Science. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 20.1 Your data science project Lesson 20.2 Summary Discussion Prompt: What have you learned? .

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

1. Computers, tablets, and phones are connected to each other through networks, allowing communication between devices.
2. A network consists of multiple computers connected together using links, resembling a fishing net when diagrammed and zoomed out.
3. Traditional networking used copper cables, but optic fibers and wireless networks have become increasingly popular alternatives.
4. Wireless networks use electromagnetic waves to transmit signals without physical connection, whereas wired networks rely on copper wires or fiber optics.
5. Bandwidth is the amount of data that can be sent over a network within a given time; high bandwidth networks are more desirable for data-intensive applications like streaming video.
6. Wi-Fi networks often have high bandwidth, but mobile networks may have lower bandwidth due to varying signal strengths and obstacles.
7. Reliability is another crucial factor in network performance; wired networks are generally more reliable than wireless ones due to their physical connection.
8. Wireless networks can be unreliable due to factors like signal strength, walls, and interference from other users.
9. Networks require a physical infrastructure to link computers, either through wires or electromagnetic waves.
10. However, mere connectivity is not enough; computers must also understand the messages being sent to them using a standardized language called protocols.
11. Protocols follow strict rules that define how communication occurs, when messages are sent, and what they contain.
12. If two computers use different protocols, they cannot understand each other, leading to failed communication.
13. There are various types of networks that differ in physical medium and protocols used, such as Wi-Fi, cellular networks, and wired networks.
14. These differences can create obstacles for inter-network communication, where devices on one network may not be compatible with those on another.
15. The Internet emerges as a solution to these compatibility issues by providing a standardized framework for communication between different types of networks.

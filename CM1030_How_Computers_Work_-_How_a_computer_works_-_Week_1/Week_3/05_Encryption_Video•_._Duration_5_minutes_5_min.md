Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

The Internet relies on routers to forward messages between computers, but this also means that any message sent can be read by computers controlled by others. To ensure private online communications, encryption is used to send messages in codes that can only be read by the intended recipient. Encryption involves converting text into an unreadable form using a mathematical algorithm and a key. Julius Caesar's code, which replaced each letter with a letter three places along the alphabet, demonstrates this principle. Modern internet communications use more sophisticated algorithms, but they still convert text into an unreadable format.

Encryption algorithms are designed to be difficult to crack, even with the world's fastest computers. However, encryption is not foolproof, and there are ways to get around it. Phishing attacks can trick users into using the wrong key, while malicious routers can intercept packets sent to a bank or other secure website. To defend against these attacks, certificates are used to validate public keys and ensure they come from trustworthy sources.

Every public key has a certificate that demonstrates its validity, which is issued by trusted security companies. Web browsers can check whether a certificate is valid before using it for encryption. If the certificate is not valid, the browser will display a warning message, indicating that the encryption may be readable by criminals. Encryption is the basis of many defenses against security threats, and understanding how it works is crucial to staying safe online.

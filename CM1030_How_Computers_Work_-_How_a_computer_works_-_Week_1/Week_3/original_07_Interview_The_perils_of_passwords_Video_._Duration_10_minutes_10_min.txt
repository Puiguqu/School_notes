So how people interact with computers. In this course, we've been learning a lot about what happens inside the computer. But in a sense, all of that is useless if people can't interact and understand what their computer interface is doing. One of the things we've been learning about is computer security and passwords. Now, you've been doing some research, not on passwords, but on passcodes. What's the difference between a password and a passcode? >> Thank you for acknowledging that there's a difference between the two of those two things. Well, the difference between a password and a passcode is who sets it and who chooses it. A password is something that you and I work with every day, every time we want to access our email or even unlock our phone. It's something we have chosen to show that we are who we are. It's something that we and only we should know, and the computer can check to see whether or not we've entered the correct password. A passcode, on the other hand, is something that is given to us. So if we are trying to access something or gain access to a service, for example, the service themselves will decide and design a passcode for you, give it to you, and you will have to enter it. The difference between those two things, and they sound quite similar at first, is how frequently you use them. So a password is something you'll use multiple times a day, probably, whereas a passcode is something that's usually a one-time only use. It will be used to prove who you are and then that will be it. >> Can you tell us a little bit about the research you've done on passcodes? >> Yeah, so the useful thing about passcodes is that they could be really helpful when we start to think about the Internet of Things. So more and more often, we are coming across everyday objects that can connect to the Internet and are accessed by an account. But it's quite hard to log into some of these Internet of Things. So for example, if you have to enter your email address and password into a Internet-enabled light bulb, that would be really quite difficult to do. And there are so many of these objects, washing machines, TVs, radios, a whole range of different objects that we need to log into, but they don't have the interface that we're used to. They don't have that keyboard we need when we're giving that type of textual information. And so I want to look at how passcodes can be used to enable us to link these Internet of Things objects with a more suitable input device like a laptop or a mobile phone, for example. And the way that the passcode works in this situation is that a passcode is displayed on one of these devices, maybe on the screen of a TV or on the LCD display of a radio, for example. And that passcode is something that you will then take and you will copy it, enter it into your laptop or your mobile phone. And then you can say, and this this belongs to this account. So it's a one-time use thing that allows you to then from now on control that Internet of Things device using your laptop and your mobile phone, which are a bit better suited to entering email data than a washing machine. >> And we talk a little bit about what makes a good password, or in this case, a good passcode, and you use the phrase search space, so what does that mean? Yeah, that's a good question. So search space refers to the number of possible different passwords or passcodes that could be generated. And this is a really important thing to consider when you're trying to design the security of a system. So if you didn't need a system to be that secure, if you didn't think there were that many people using it, for example, you could design a password or a passcode with a very small search space. That would be, say, I wanted someone to use three different numerical digits, and that gives you 1,000 different possible choices from 000 to 999. That's quite a small search space, and it means that if someone nefarious wanted try and get into the system, then they would be quite easily able to brute force their way in and guess these passcodes or passwords. However, if you wanted to make something more secure, then you make the search space a lot larger, and you ask people to enter, for example, special characters or use capital letters or use numbers. You're starting hear these terms when you sign up to news services online, for example. Whenever they ask you to use a special character, they're making the search space for that password even bigger. The way that you decide the size of the search space that you need depends on how many people you think might be using the service at the same time. So for a passcode, for example, if you're asking people on a TV show, all at the same time, you're saying, now pair your TV with your mobile phone. At that point, there's probably millions of people trying to pair their TV at the same time. So for that reason, you will need to parse code with a large search space. But if you're doing a small one-off service that's maybe only being used by a company, for example, with only a few hundred employees, then you might need a smaller search space that usually makes the passcodes a lot easier to enter as well. >> So from the point of view computers, having a big search space is really good. But humans can often find that hard, can't they? Why is that? >> Yeah, absolutely, what makes a good password for a computer is not necessarily one as a good password for a human. Very often we will end up trying to create a really long password because we know that feels quite secure, but what we'll end up doing is putting patterns in that we as humans recognize. Well, if we recognize them, a computer is able to recognize them and guess them quite easily. So what we should be thinking about rather than putting in these patterns is putting together lots of pieces of information that can vary more widely than digits and letters, for example. That's quite an abstract thing to say, so I think you might have another follow-up question for me [LAUGH]. >> Well, yes. So you've done the research, you've done about your smart TVs, what was the answer? How do you make good passcodes? >> Yeah, so the initial thing that we were asked to do was that we needed to make a passcode that had a search space of above 500 million. Now, to do that, we were looking at what we could do with just asking people to enter a passcode full of numbers and numbers alone. To do that, we created a passcode that had nine digits in it. That was all well and good, that's quite common, Another thing that you might see when you're entering passcodes is, for example, entering a WiFi router password. Now, I don't know if you've gone over to a friend's house and they haven't changed the password for their router. And they give you the sheet of paper and it's full of uppercase, lowercase letters and digits all over the place. Well, that makes for quite a secure passcode. So you can use fewer digits to create the same search space. And in our experiment, we created a passcode that was five characters long, and those characters were comprised of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and numbers. Now, these two things, although they're secure enough, they aren't actually that user-friendly. And one thing we thought was actually why we're asking people just to enter nonsense information. Why can't we make it a bit more human-friendly? And so what we did is we decided to design a passcode that was comprised of three three-letter long English words, like cat, bee, and dog. Other words are available. They don't all have to be animals. But what that means was that we were still creating this search space of over 500 million, because there are around 1,000 English words that have three letters in them. Now, it was just as secure, but it didn't necessarily look it to users because we recognize those words. But it has a number of benefits. One of the benefits is that we recognize these characters, so it's a lot easier for us to copy. And another potential benefit was that when we're entering these passcodes on our mobile phones, they can actually be easier. Because on our mobile phones, unlike a regular keyboard, we have to switch between keyboards. If we want to move from a lowercase to an uppercase to a number, we have to tap a button to change that. That adds an addition level of cognitive processing, and it adds an extra amount of time. Every button press you have to add adds an extra bit of time. So by just asking people to enter lowercase letters for these words, we were potentially making it a lot quicker. >> So what was the result of that research? >> Yeah, so after testing out users using just numbers, users using a mix of alphanumeric characters, and users these three three English words, we found out that the English words was actually the best system. How did we define best? Well, we wanted to look at the speed that users were able to copy these codes down. We wanted to look at the number of errors they made when they copied these codes. It's infuriating when you copy someone's WiFi router password down and you've got a single mistake somewhere. So we want to minimize that as much as we possibly can. And we also looked at the number of eye gazes that people made to the screen that they were copying from, and we found that in all instances, the three English words were far better than the numbers and the alphanumeric codes. Thus meaning that they would make the best passcode for these Internet of Things devices. >> And would a sort of similar approach be a good idea for somebody trying to choose a good password for a website or something? >> Yeah, it absolutely would. The number of English words that we have far outweighs the number of digits and characters that we have. So if you put together five English words, for example, you're creating a really large search space that's quite hard to find out. There is an XKCD comic on the fact that might elaborate that solution a bit more clearly. But it's counterintuitive to humans because as I say, we recognize these words, but because there are more words than digits and numbers, they can actually be more secure. >> Okay, well, thanks a lot Sarah. That's really informative and help students understand a bit more about computer security, how it interacts with human-computer interaction, and the important issue of passcodes. >> Great, thank you. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 3.0 Introduction Lesson 3.1: Networks Lesson 3.2: Security Video: Video Security threats .

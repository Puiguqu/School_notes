Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key I'd like to introduce Joe Hall who is a system administrator at the Department of Computing here at Goldsmiths. Joe, you look after the computers in the labs here at Goldsmiths, including this one we're sitting in now. Could let us know a little bit about what the machines in the labs are and who uses those machines? >> So, as you can see we've got, we're all Apple iMacs in this lab and in our three other labs as well. And we set these machines up to Mac OS and Windows. They are used by students in the department. So the labs are primarily used for teaching. >> And can you tell us how you make sure that people who shouldn't access the computers don't have access to them? And why do you need to restrict access to the computers? >> Sure. To log into the computer, you need to have a Goldsmiths user account. So Goldsmiths user accounts are centrally managed, and so only people with Goldsmiths user accounts can log in to these computers to use them. So that restricts them to students in Goldsmiths. The labs are used by our students within the department but they're also used for short courses and sometimes for other departments as well. So we don't restrict the computers to just students from my department, they are available for everybody within Goldsmiths to use. >> How do you make sure that since all the students are storing files in these computers that one student can't mess up the files of another student? >> So when a student logs into these machines, it then will mount a network storage drive for them that's their own personal network storage. So we advise students to save all their work to network storage. And that network storage is secured so only that student has access to it. Also if they are to save work onto one of the machines locally, then because of the way that user accounts work on MacOS and Windows anybody else who loads onto that machine won't have access to that user's data, user. So it separates out all the user data into separate areas. >> So you've got an administrator account on all of these machines? What does that mean? What does that allow you to do and why do you need it? >> So an administrator account on the machines gives us access to pretty much everything that's on the machine. And because we manage these computers and we manage all software and settings to these computers, we need a way to do that. And having a local admin account allows us to manage that software and that settings. A lot of this stuff we do remotely with remote tools, but those tools use those accounts to manage the software and the settings and any functions that we want to perform on the computer. >> Okay, thank you Joe. That's very helpful. That helps us understand how a professional organization manages the security of their computers. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 3.0 Introduction Lesson 3.1: Networks Lesson 3.2: Security Video: Video Security threats .

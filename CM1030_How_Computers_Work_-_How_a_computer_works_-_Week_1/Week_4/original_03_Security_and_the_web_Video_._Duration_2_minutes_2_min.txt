So those messages could be read by malicious computers. They also respond to requests from computers all over the world. Some of which might be trying to hack them and extract private data. We use websites for many security sensitive types of information. We store personal photos on photo sites and share them with friends on social media, even though we would never want them to be seen by strangers. Companies use web-based platforms to store commercially sensitive data and many of us rely on online banks to keep our money safe. It should come as no surprise that websites use encryption. The basic protocol that websites use is called HTTP where there is a secure encrypted version called HTTPS. The S stands for secure. When using HTTPS, all data transmitted is encrypted. You can tell that your website is using HTTPS because it will show HTTPS rather than HTTP in the URL, and most browsers will show a little padlock sign. If you don't see this for your bank website you should be very worried. Lots of websites also use access control. They ask you to login before you can access parts of a websites with your private or sensitive information. This can protect you because you can only access your data with your login, and it protects the website itself because it won't be accessible to computers that are not logged in. Strong encryption ensures that login name and passwords are secure. Having said that, there are many ways that the software that runs websites can be hacked and new ways are being discovered all the time. If you have a personal website make sure that you always install the latest software updates because newer versions of the software will have security fixes that guard against the lightest viruses and hacks. So, you will notional machine of a website should also include security. You should be aware of when you should be logged in or not. You should also know whether or not the data being sent is encrypted and be careful if it's not or if the security certificate is not valid. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 4.1 Web applications Video: Video Websites .

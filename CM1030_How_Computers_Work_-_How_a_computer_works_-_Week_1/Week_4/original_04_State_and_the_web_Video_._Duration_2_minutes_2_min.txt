## VIDEO TRANSCRIPT ## You may navigate through the transcript using tab. To save a note for a section of text press CTRL + S. To expand your selection you may use CTRL + arrow key. You may contract your selection using shift + CTRL + arrow key. For screen readers that are incompatible with using arrow keys for shortcuts, you can replace them with the H J K L keys. Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key As we've already learnt, software has state, a collection of changing configurations that can affect how you interact with it. The same is true of websites. The obvious state of a website is the page you're viewing. On an e-commerce site, the product's page is a different state from the About page. The product you're viewing is the current state. We've already seen that an e-commerce site goes through a number of states between you browsing a product and buying it. Sites also track more subtle states. For example, an e-commerce site will often remember which items you've viewed and display them to you somewhere on the page so that you can access them easily. The site doesn't do that entirely for your benefit though. You'll probably receive targeted adverts for that product later in the hope that you'll buy it. Logging in is another obvious example of state. What you can do if you're logged in is very different from what you can do if you're not. Many of the problems we can encounter online are due to a website logging us out without us knowing, which can sometimes happen if we've been away from our computer for a long time. State is everywhere in websites, so the next thing I'm going to say might surprise you. Web servers, where websites are stored, mostly have no state. They always respond to the same request in the same way and don't change based on what you do with them. How is that possible? How can your interaction with websites have so much state if the servers themselves have no state? Some of the state, as we've said, is based on which page you're viewing. As we make requests for new pages, the state of our view of the site changes even if the site doesn't. But there are also states that change within a single page. The most important way that websites keep track of state is something called cookies. Cookies are small amounts of data that websites store on our computers as we use those sites. They're stored by our browser software on our computer, not on the server, and they're designed to keep track of the state of the websites. Cookies are how websites track whether we're logged in or not and how they know our browsing history. Many people worry about the privacy implications of cookies, but the worst privacy violations do not use cookies and most websites would simply not work without them. So your notional machine of a website would need to include some consideration of how it's affected by state. I hope that thinking about state will help you work better with the websites that you use on a daily basis. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 4.1 Web applications Video: Video Websites .

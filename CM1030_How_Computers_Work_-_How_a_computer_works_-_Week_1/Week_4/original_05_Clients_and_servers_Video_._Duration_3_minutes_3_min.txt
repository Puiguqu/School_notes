## VIDEO TRANSCRIPT ## You may navigate through the transcript using tab. To save a note for a section of text press CTRL + S. To expand your selection you may use CTRL + arrow key. You may contract your selection using shift + CTRL + arrow key. For screen readers that are incompatible with using arrow keys for shortcuts, you can replace them with the H J K L keys. Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key Another computer science concept we've looked at already is modularity, the idea that applications are built out of lots of simple elements or modules that work together. Websites are very modular. They rely on lots of different components working together. This is a crucial part of our notional machine. The most obvious modules are the client, which is your computer and your web browser and the server, which is the website's computer and the software running on it. Each of these, particularly the server can have different elements. A basic web server consists of a number of web pages, each one being one or more files called HTML files. When a request comes in, one of the pages is sent to the client. This is quite simple. But most modern websites are a lot more complex than that. Web pages are created only when they are needed in response to particular requests. For example, your profile on a social media site is not stored in the server as a file. It's created just for you only when you request it. A database is a software platform designed to store data in a structured way that's easy to access for a computer. It's efficient to get data from a database, but it's also to add new data to it. A social media site will store my profile information in a database, for example, my name, age, and gender. As I add new information or new users join, the data is added to the database. Databases make it possible to extend the information available on a website without anyone having to create new pages. The pages we see are created by the server using data from a database. Instead of having a webpage stored on the server, the website will store a template page which contains formatting for a webpage such as a social media profile. The template page contains a lot of empty spaces, for example, spaces for a name, age and gender, which are filled with data from the database. The web server software combines the templates with the data from the database to create pages that are then transmitted to your browser. Template might be stored as a file, just like a traditional webpage. Webpage formatting is done using a type of file called HTML, which is the basic language of the web and is typically used together with another formatting language called CSS. Almost everything we see in a website is a combination of page templates that were designed by people and data from a database that has been gradually collected during the lifetime of a website. The interaction between web servers, databases, and browsers is just one example of how lots of different software contributes to creating websites, making them some of the most modular applications there are. You can expand your notional machine of a website to include the fact that a server doesn't simply store webpages, it creates them using templates and databases. Well done in getting so far and getting to the point where you understand such complex software. If you want to become a web developer, you really need to understand these interactions very well. But knowing the basics will also help you if all you want to do is use websites effectively. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 4.1 Web applications Video: Video Websites .

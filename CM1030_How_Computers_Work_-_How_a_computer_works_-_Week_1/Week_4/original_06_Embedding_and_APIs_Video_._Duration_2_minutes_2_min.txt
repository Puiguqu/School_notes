## VIDEO TRANSCRIPT ## You may navigate through the transcript using tab. To save a note for a section of text press CTRL + S. To expand your selection you may use CTRL + arrow key. You may contract your selection using shift + CTRL + arrow key. For screen readers that are incompatible with using arrow keys for shortcuts, you can replace them with the H J K L keys. Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key So far, we've talked as if everything on a web page comes from a single website. But this isn't always or even often true. Where pages can make use of little bits of information of functionality provided by the website. The web page you'll see in the video on contains instructions that tells your browser to make a request to YouTube to display the video. Another example of embedding is advertising. Advertising on a website will not be created by the website owner. That will be added by third party advertising service. This is one of the reasons that you get the same adverts wherever you are on the web. Online payments are also typically handled with embedding. I wouldn't trust a small online shop to create its own secure online payment system. But I don't have to because the payment system you'd find in common sites are provided by specialist services like PayPal Another way that a website can gain data from other servers is via an API short for Application Programming Interface. You can think of an API as a version of the website that's designed not for humans to look at, but for computer programs. Another web server can access data from an API and combine it with other elements to create a whole new website. APIs are how we can have different versions of the same application. Almost all major online applications whether the social networks, online shopping sites or travel booking platforms, are available both as a website or mobile apps. They can be accessed on your phone or tablets. In fact there will be different versions of mobile app for Apple, Android or Windows devices. The developers of the application created an API that makes it possible to access the data. This can then be used to display the date to a different way and in that or in a website. Often, these versions of the application will be created by the same company but not always. Part of the popularity of Twitter, comes from the fact that other developers were able to create mobile apps using these APIs. Many of which were available before Twitter created its own mobile app. So your notional machine of a website is now a bit more complex. It isn't just based on a single web server but also includes embedded information. Now, you know how websites combine information from many different sources, look at the size that you use most often and see if you can figure out where everything comes from. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 4.1 Web applications Video: Video Websites .

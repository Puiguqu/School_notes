You may contract your selection using shift + CTRL + arrow key. For screen readers that are incompatible with using arrow keys for shortcuts, you can replace them with the H J K L keys. Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key You might have noticed that when you open a very big file on your computer, it can slow down or even freeze. Why is that? As you've learnt, one of the biggest differences between different types of data storage is speed. Main memory is much faster than hard disks. That means that loading a file from disk is much slower than manipulating a file in memory, so loading a large file will be a slow operation and can freeze your application while it's happening, but that isn't the whole picture. Sometimes, if a file is really big, the application is slowed down even after the file's loaded. What happens if the file is so big that there isn't enough space in main memory to hold it all? What if you got so many applications open that they use all the memory? Even if you have a lot of memory on your computer, it could easily fill up with the operating system and other applications and not have enough space to load a big video file, for example. When your operating system runs out of memory, it doesn't just fail to load a file, that will be unhelpful. It uses something called virtual memory. When main memory is full, it saves some of what should be in memory to the hard disk in an area called virtual memory. It does its best to make sure that what it puts in virtual memory is something you are unlikely to use immediately. Perhaps the memory area of an application that's open in the background, but you're not currently using. So, most of the time virtual memory won't have a noticeable effect, apart from maybe when you switch applications. But, you have to remember that hard disks and therefore virtual memory are much slower than real memory. That means, if you're trying to edit a file that's in virtual memory, your application can slow down. This can happen if you load a file that's very big and it can't all be stored in main memory. So, if your computer has been very slow recently, you might think that it's processor isn't powerful enough, but it might in fact be that it hasn't got enough memory for what it's doing and it's relying too much on virtual memory. That's a good thing to know because upgrading memory is generally cheaper and much easier than upgrading your processor. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 5.0 Introduction Lesson 5.1 Data storage Discussion Prompt: Storage devices .

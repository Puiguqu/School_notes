We've been learning about how computers represent data, but it's also really important to know how people think about data, and how that affects how we interact with computers. So Sarah, we've been looking at how computers represent numbers, but we also want to think about how people think about numbers, and one area where that's really important is number entry. Could you tell us a little bit about number entry and why it's important? Yeah. So, number entry is probably one of the smallest elements of human-computer interaction, but it's a really important one. It purely refers to whenever humans want to give some data to a computer for whatever reason. So, that might be you dialing a phone number for example, or it might be you telling the ATM machine what your PIN is so that you can get some money out. It happens quite frequently, but it can have some very interesting consequences if it goes wrong. So, we've heard about how computers represent numbers, how do people think about numbers? People like to think about numbers in a variety of different ways. One of the obvious ways is that numbers represents quantities. If we are telling an ATM how much money we want out, we know that if we enter in a 100, we're getting out twice as much than if we had entered in 50 for example. So, that's one way that we imagine that we will think about numbers, but actually numbers aren't always used to represent quantitative amounts. For example, if we were to look at our two phone numbers written down, it wouldn't matter to us which one was larger or which one was smaller than the other, that's not how we think about those numbers in that situation. In that situation, the numbers could be anything, we could replace all of the seven's with squares and it would still mean the same thing. So, it's important to realize when we are designing number entry interfaces that although numbers usually represent quantitative amounts, that they don't always do that. Sometimes as humans, we don't necessarily process what those numbers mean, what their value is, what the size of them is, and that can sometimes lead to some problems. So, can you tell us a little bit about the research you've done on number entry? Yeah. So, number entry is actually really important, and it's actually quite important when it goes wrong. So, number entry when it is done badly can affect the way that financial institutions work. We read every now and then in the newspaper about a company that has decided to float on the stock market for the first time for example, and the employee responsible for telling the stock market how much each of the shares would be worth may have mixed up the value of the share with the number of stocks they have on offer, thus meaning that a company that should have sold 100 stocks for 1,000 pounds each ended up selling 1,000 stocks for a 100 pounds each thus grossly misestimating the value of their company sometimes resulting in companies crushing and going bust. So, it's quite important in the financial domain, but the most interesting area that I think number entry needs to be researched in is in the medical domain. So, numbers are entered in all of the time in the medical domain. From the very beginning of your entry into hospital, for example the receptionist entering in your date of birth. That's going to be very important because that's how you're going to be looked up in the record system. We also enter in the patient's height details and weight details. There have been instances where patients heights have been recorded in correctly, and thus when it came to get a transplant, for example a lung transplant, the patients height was recorded incorrectly and therefore the lungs that the patient were given were not the right size, and the patient didn't survive. From a more common point of view is that nurses and medical workers will be entering numbers into those devices that sit next to the patient's bedside, you might have seen them on medical dramas. They sit there and they beep away. Their job is not to beep, their job however is to run drugs into the patient. The way that the device knows how much to run into the patient, how quickly it needs to go in is by a nurse or medical worker having typed in some digits. For example, I want a 100 mils to go in over the course of three hours. If any error is made during that process, then it could result in a patient receiving a serious under or overdose thus resulting in patient harm and sometimes patient death as well. This is something that is unfortunately quite a frequent occurrence. It happens because these devices aren't sometimes not tested very well with users, and it happens because the users are not casual people like you and I or, day job sometimes we get stressed, but it's very rare that our jobs result in someone's life being on the line. But nurses and medical workers are often very very stressed, and so they're being asked to use these number entry devices, and they are being asked to use it under immense amounts of pressure which can often leads to errors. Think about the number of times that you've accidentally dialed a phone number wrongly for example. If it was easy enough to do it, then imagine how hard it would be to get numbers right all of the time when you're doing it in high-pressure situation like a hospital. So, what makes a good number entry system? That's a really good question. I think if we knew the exact answer to that then we would be able to prevent a lot of harm being done, but unfortunately it's not as easy as it would seem. So, a good number entry system might be one that results in no errors being made. In which case, we might want to say that the user has to wait one minute between every single digit that they enter, so that they can use that minute to very carefully study the number they think they are about to enter and thus press it when the time came. This might be a number entry system that had very few errors, but it would be incredibly infuriating for users, and it would mean that we couldn't get much done if users had to spend five minutes every time they needed to enter a number. So, on the other hand we might say that we want to optimize for speed. We're all very good at working with number pads, we see them quite often on our phones, on ATMs, on calculators. So, we're quite good at using them, thus making them really speedy to use. So, in a hospital we might say actually we want that to be the case, we want people to be able to enter numbers as quickly as possible so that the patient can get the drugs as quickly as possible. This is a great idea, but if you go quickly you often end up losing accuracy, and you end up making errors. This isn't because you're being lazy, absolutely isn't the case, it's just because you're human and humans make errors when they're doing things. So, a kind of middle ground might be a system that is not serial entry, which is what we call something where you enter it in digit by digit, but might be accumulative entry. This is something like when you are choosing the temperature that your oven needs to go out. If you have a dial on it, you're slowly increasing the number that you are entering. If you enter 200 for example, you don't enter to two zero zero, you go through all of the numbers until you get to 200. In the hospital, there are systems like this where you have to add 10 to the dose you want to add by pressing a button each time and seeing the number 10 slowly being added to the number in front of you. This is a bit slower, but it has the benefit of meaning that a user has to always look at the display on the device to see what the number is, they can't just assume they've got it right which is what often happens when you enter it via keypad method. So, making errors is a big thing in number entry, what about checking in case you have made an error? Yeah. Now, this is a really important thing. It's not just the case that we need to think about how the devices are designed, but we need to make sure we think about how the entire task is designed, how can we encourage users to double-check the numbers that they have entered? Users are very notoriously bad at checking things. Think about the last time you closed a Word document for example, a pop-up probably came up asking if you wanted to save the changes, without thinking you probably said yes or no, and didn't really worry about it. We're not very good at being made to check things. So, we can design systems so that they can check the numbers that we've entered. In the hospital for example, each infusion of drugs that is drugs being given to a patient via one of these devices has three pieces of information, it has the volume of the drug that needs to go into the patient, it has the time that this drug needs to take as it goes into the patient, and it has the rate. So, something like milliliters per hour for example. Now, with these three pieces of information, we can triangulate the data we have. So, if we know the volume and the time for instance, we can calculate the rate. This means that if we asked all users to enter in all three pieces of information, the computer, the device itself could multiply and divide the necessary numbers and ensure that all three numbers were predicted. If it multiplied the volume by the rate and didn't get the correct time for example, then it could alert the user and say you've made an error. Again, that does add a bit of time to the to the interactions, so that might not always be the correct decision, but it's an opportunity for us to help users to double-check their number entry and to hopefully prevent the types of errors occurring that caused patient harm or death. Have you seen any really bad number entry interfaces? Marco, I've seen thousands of very bad number entry interfaces, and I collect them in a very nerdy folder on my computer. I would say one of my favorite ones at the moment and this sparked off an entire meme of bad number entry interfaces was one that allowed users to enter their nine digit telephone number. Not by entering the digits one by one like you would when you say dial a telephone number, but by asking users to select from three drop-down boxes. Each of those drop-down boxes had the numbers 0-0-0 to 9-9-9 in them, meaning that you had to split your telephone number into three digits, and then you had to scroll through to select it. It was absolutely ridiculously over-engineered and would have taken a lot more work for the web designer to make than just having a number entry interface box. This spawned an entire range of terrible number entry interfaces including one that required users to play the game Tetris and create the digits that they wanted to from the blocks falling from the top. Okay. So, that's pretty bad, what about a good one? I mean you can't beat the keypad. It's very good, it's very efficient, and usually we don't make errors on them. My favorite of keypad that I have ever seen though was at my local bowling alley, which rather than representing the numbers 1-9 in that three-by-three grid that we are very used to, represented them like the bowling pins that you were trying to throw your ball at. I think that's very good theming, and I really enjoyed seeing that one. Okay. Well thanks a lot Sarah. That's so great insight in to thinking about how people upset numbers and how people and computers interact via numbers. So, thank you very much. Thank you. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 5.0 Introduction Lesson 5.1 Data storage Lesson 5.2 Data representation Discussion Prompt: Data representation in bits .

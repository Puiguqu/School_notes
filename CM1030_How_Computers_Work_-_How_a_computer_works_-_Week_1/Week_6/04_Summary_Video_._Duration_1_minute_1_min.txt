Data representation is a crucial topic in computer science. Computers rely on data to function, and their ability to represent different types of data is a powerful feature. The bit is a fundamental unit of data representation that can be used to store numbers, letters, and even complex data like video. Bits are stored in main memory and mass storage devices. Compression algorithms are used to store data efficiently, making it more manageable for computers to process.

Data manipulation, including changing, processing, and viewing data, is essential in computer science. This topic will be explored in detail, covering various techniques and methods. Data representation forms the basis of many other topics in computer science, such as file formats and compression algorithms.

Compression algorithms are a critical aspect of data representation, allowing computers to store large amounts of data in a compact form. File formats, which determine how data is stored and retrieved, will be discussed in more detail. The duration of various lessons and assignments is also provided, giving an overview of the structure and pacing of the course.

Overall, understanding data representation and manipulation is vital for becoming a proficient computer scientist. The next topic will delve into manipulating data, covering key concepts and techniques.

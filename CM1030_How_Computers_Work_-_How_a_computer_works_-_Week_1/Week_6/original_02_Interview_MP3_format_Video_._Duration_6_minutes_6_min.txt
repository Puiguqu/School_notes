I'd like to welcome Dr. Matthew King who among many other things is very talented electronic musician and computer music researcher. Today Mathew I'd like to talk about really important file format for music called MP3. Do you want to tell us a little bit about what MP3 is? Yeah, MP3 is a file format that lets you store audio, things like music or speech In quite a compact form. What impact has MP3 had on how we listen to and share music? Well, before we had MP3, it was quite difficult to move music files around. So, actually, because of the size of the files it meant that it wasn't realistic to send music over the Internet very quickly or share music over the Internet. Really the big impact that MP3 is most famous for, is for making these files much smaller. Then people were able to share files on the internet and share music around. So, it really triggered the whole movement of a different way of distributing music on the internet where people were sending files around really quickly and able to have large collections of music stored on their computers and yet it really heralded a new age of music distribution. Part of the way the MP3 makes music file smaller is because there is a compressed format. Now, we've been learning about compression. Is MP3 lossless or lossy compression format? We would call MP3 a lossy compression format. Because, once you've turned your music or sound into an MP3 file, you can then not completely perfectly recreate the recording that you started off with. So, that's why we call it lossy because we lose information. But the part that is sort of plus side of it being lossy is that it can actually be smaller because we are able to throw away enough information to make a really small file. MP3 uses a psycho-acoustic model in its compression. What does that mean? Well, this is how it achieves its sort of lossy compression. So, the idea is that psycho-acoustics, it tells us how people perceive sound and how humans make sense of audio coming in through their ears is really. The thing is we don't perfectly perceive sound. So, there are certain things that happen when you perceive sound. Where you're not actually able to hear everything that's going on. MP3, the format it takes advantage of the fact that we can't perfectly perceive sound and therefore takes away some of the information that we are not able to actually perceive. So, if things like if you have the same signal in both channels then you can compress that down to one channel, or if a low frequency sound, people find it quite difficult to work out whether that's coming from the left channel and the right channel. So why not just put it in the middle? So, there's various things which are known about how humans perceive sound which allow them to get rid of information and make a smaller file. Now, you've talked a little bit about the frequency of sounds. So, does MP3 use frequencies in the way it compresses sound? It does yeah. So, I mentioned the low-frequency sounds and how it's difficult to positionally interpret low-frequency sounds. So, why not just put it in the middle and thus not have to have two channels of it. But there's also other things where you get frequencies which might mask other frequencies, or loud sounds which might mask quiet sounds. So it's possible to identify parts of that frequency spectrum, which are masked by other sounds so that you can remove them. Okay. We've talked about the advantage of MP3 being that it can reduce the size of a lot of audio files. Are there any disadvantages of MP3? Well, people think that MP3 is not a high quality audio format. But as far as I'm aware, most sort of tests blind listener tests, if you like where people don't know which format they're listening to. Whether it's a CD which is an uncompressed format or whether it's an MP3. People find it very difficult to differentiate between the two. Although, when you make an MP3, you can choose how lossy it is. So, if you go for the smallest possible size of MP3, yes it sounds really crunchy and it's obvious that it's not the proper sound. But if you go for the higher quality versions of MP3, actually it's very difficult to tell the difference. I guess the disadvantage here is that, it meant that they had to come up with a completely new way of distributing music on the internet, which had a massive impact in the music industry. Yeah, I guess if you're archiving sound for future analysis or reference, then you are throwing away information and you never know in the future that we might want that information. So, it might not be the ideal format for archiving recordings of the environment or animals or even just music in general. Do you use MP3 in your own work? Yes. So, the typical workflows or when I worked more intensively as a musician in my earlier years as MP3 was quite important format for being able to quickly share examples of tracks that you are working on. Also allowed me to really get access to a much wider range of music. In the early days of people listening to music and distributing music on the internet. MP3 made it possible to really access things that previously, the only way you could hear them would be by finding the record or finding a copy of that physical copy. So, it really opened up the Pandora's box of music. Okay. Well, thanks alot Matthew. That's been really interesting. I'm sure our students will love hearing about MP3. Thank you. Okay. Thank you. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 6.1 Compression Discussion Prompt: Data compression . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min Video: Video Compression .

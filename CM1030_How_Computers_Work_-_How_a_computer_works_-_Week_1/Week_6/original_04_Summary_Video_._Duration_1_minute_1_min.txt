Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key Well done. You have now got the grips with one of the most important topics in computer science, data representation. Data is vital to computing. Every computing application comes down to manipulating some form of data. And one of the most powerful things about computers is they can represent so many different types of data. All these is thanks to the Bit which is very simple. But because it's abstract, it can form the building blocks of many, many other types of data. You've learned how data can be stored in main memory and mass storage. And how bits can be used to represent numbers, letters, and something as complex as video. You've also learned about the power of compression algorithms to store data efficiently. All of these things will be very important as you start to become a computer scientist. Data forms the basis of almost everything else you'll study in computer science. But just storing data isn't enough. For it to be useful, we need to do things to data. Change it, process it, and view it. So the next thing we need to learn about is how to manipulate data. Manipulating data could almost be the entire subject of computer science. But in the next topic, we'll start to look at how it's done. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 6.1 Compression Lesson 6.2 Summary Peer-graded Assignment: File formats .

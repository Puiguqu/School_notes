Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

1. The CPU (Central Processing Unit) is the active part of a computer that performs calculations and instructions.
2. Data is moved between memory and the CPU using a bus, a set of wiring that connects the two.
3. The arithmetic logical unit (ALU) performs numerical mathematical calculations within the CPU.
4. The control unit controls the running of a program by executing instructions and making choices.
5. Registers are small amounts of memory on the CPU that can store data, allowing for quick access to it.
6. Data is loaded from memory into registers before being manipulated using the ALU.
7. The cache is a smaller, faster set of memory that stores frequently used values, reducing the need to access main memory.
8. The CPU has multiple layers of memory, including registers, cache, and main memory, which affect its performance.
9. Instructions are stored in memory like data, using the stored program concept.
10. The program counter (PC) tells the CPU where to find the current instruction in memory.
11. The instruction register stores the current instruction being executed by the CPU.
12. The fetch-execute cycle involves fetching an instruction from memory based on the PC and then executing it.
13. While CPU speed is important, bus speed and memory speed have a greater impact on computer performance.
14. A large and fast cache can significantly improve computer performance by reducing the need to access main memory.
15. When considering buying a computer, factors like cache size, bus speed, and memory speed are just as important as CPU speed.

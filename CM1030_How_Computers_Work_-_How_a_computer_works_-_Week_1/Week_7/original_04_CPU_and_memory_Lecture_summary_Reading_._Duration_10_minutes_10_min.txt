General summary This lecture provides an in-depth look at the Central Processing Unit (CPU) and its role within a computer system. It covers the primary components and functions of the CPU, including the bus, arithmetic logical unit, control unit, registers and cache. The lecture explains how data is moved and processed within the CPU, the concept of the stored program, and the importance of various factors like bus speed and cache size in determining computer performance. Key concepts and examples CPU and memory interaction Description: Data is moved between memory and the CPU via the bus, a set of wires that allows fast data interchange. Example: The bus connects the CPU and memory, enabling the CPU to access and process data quickly. Arithmetic logical unit (ALU) Description: The ALU performs numerical and logical calculations, forming the core of the CPU's computational abilities. Example: Adding values to variables or performing mathematical operations are tasks handled by the ALU. Control unit Description: The control unit manages the execution of instructions within a program, including conditional operations like 'if' statements. Example: Deciding which bit of code to execute based on a condition is controlled by the control unit. Registers Description: Registers are small, fast memory locations within the CPU used to store data temporarily during calculations. Example: Data is loaded from main memory into registers for quick access during arithmetic operations. Cache memory Description: The cache is a smaller, faster type of memory located close to the CPU, used to store frequently accessed data to speed up processing. Example: A large and fast cache can significantly enhance computer performance by reducing the need to access slower main memory. Stored program concept Description: Programs and instructions are stored in memory just like data, allowing flexibility in using different software on the same hardware. Example: The CPU fetches and executes instructions from memory, enabling the use of various software applications. Fetch-execute cycle Description: The CPU operates in a cycle of fetching instructions from memory and executing them, guided by special registers like the program counter and instruction register. Example: The program counter indicates the location of the next instruction, which is then loaded into the instruction register for execution. Factors influencing computer performance Description: While CPU speed (measured in gigahertz) is important, other factors like bus speed, memory speed, and cache size also significantly impact performance. Example: A fast CPU with a slow bus or small cache may not perform as well as a balanced system with optimised components.

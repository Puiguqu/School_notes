We've already talked about peripherals and the kind of devices attached to your computer. So far, we've been talking about fairly traditional ones like displays, keyboards, and mice. But there are new generations of interactive devices that obey some of the same principles. But in other ways, these peripherals are very different, and VR or virtual reality is one of those. So, you can see here that I'm wearing a virtual reality headset, and if I pull it over my eyes, I can step inside a virtual world that completely surrounds me. So, you can think of the headset as a display similar to a screen. It's connected to the computer with this an HDMI cable. HDMI is now a very standard interface of video. It's what televisions use and it can send high definition video and also audio. You can see that my head-mounted display has headphones as well. So, that's one of the main ways that my computer can communicate with a head-mounted display in almost exactly the same way as it communicates with the standard screen by sending video data. But that's not all. This cable actually goes through my head-mounted display and ends up in two connectors. This other connector is a USB 3.0 connector. USB is a very, very standard controller for interfacing with devices. But the fact that we have two connectors is suggesting that more is happening than simply sending video to my head-mounted display. In fact, my head-mounted displays sending information back to my computer as well. Actually, the simplest and most basic use of USB for this device is power. As well as data, USB can send electrical power. So, all of the power needed for this head-mounted display is coming through the USB cable. One of the reasons it has to be USB 3.0 as opposed to earlier versions of USB is because, USB 3.0 can handle more power. But virtual reality is not just about display technology. If I'll put on my device, yes I can see through the head-mounted display. But the important thing that makes virtual reality is such a powerful experience is that if I turn my head, what I see changes just like it does in the real world. So, for example, if I want to look at something, I just turned to face it just as I would in the real world. This simple interaction makes VR feel like being in a real space rather than just watching something on screen. So, this VR headset is a two-way device in which information is sent from my computer to my device via HDMI but the data about my head movement is sent back to the computer via USB. I also have these devices called touch controllers. These are very much like traditional game controllers. They have buttons and a joystick. This is quite a traditional interface but these devices are also tracked so that they know where my hand is in space, and that's a really important thing for virtual reality because it means that if I want to interact with an object in the VR space, I don't just press a button. I can reach out and grab it. I can interact with the virtual world as if it were real. This is another powerful aspect of virtual reality, and it's enabled by peripheral devices. How did the touch controllers work? Look. Now was. They don't work via USB because USB is a wired interface. Many of the devices we use nowadays and not wired. They're wireless. Just like we use the wireless networks to connect to the internet, we can use wireless protocols to connect to peripheral devices to our computers. Most wireless devices use Bluetooth protocol to connect to your computer. But the touch controllers don't communicate directly with your computer. Instead, they connect to the headset via a proprietary wireless protocol. So, virtual reality is an example of a way of interacting with computers that relies very heavily on peripheral devices. In this case, we have head-mounted displays which also track heads moments and interface controllers like these ones. VR uses a variety of controllers and interfaces ranging from HDMI for video to USB and wireless communication. One of the interesting things about virtual reality is that it really places very strong demands on the speed at which you do things. So, I was talking just a minute ago about how when you turn your head, what you see updates as it does in the real-world. Therefore, if I turn my head to look at something, I see something different. However, in the real world that happens instantly. I physically move my head, and my eyes are pointing in a different direction. So, I see something different. There should be no delay, and if I do gets a delay in virtual reality then bad things can happen. In particular, it can cause nausea. So, if I turn my head and my view doesn't uptight because it's based on a head-mounted display not the real physical world, then I get something called simulator sickness which is very similar to the kind of motion sickness you get in a car or a boat. Now, it's not actually possible to update instantly in VR. All this involves a loss of computing time. My head-mounted display has to detect that, my head's moving. It has to send data over USB back to the computer. The computer has to a bunch of calculations to update the VR and send the information back via HDMI. Therefore, this process is not instant. However, luckily, computers have very fast and so it's possible to do all of that process in under 20 milliseconds, and if we do it in under 20 milliseconds, our human sensory system doesn't notice the difference. But 20 milliseconds is pretty fast even for a computer. There's a lot of heavy processing going on because typically, you need to do loads of high-quality computer graphics for VR which is one of the areas where the speed of your communication with your peripheral devices is really important. You would need the fastest communication protocols ever USB and HDMI to get the data in and out of your computer as quickly as possible. Then you would need your computer to be very fast, that means making sure that all the instructions that are running on your CPU one quickly. In fact for virtual reality, you're doing a lot of graphics. Typically, on a modern computer, the graphics processing doesn't happen on the CPU, it happens on another chip called the GPU. The graphics processing unit, and that works in a slightly different way. GPUs work in a parallel way, and that means they can be very fast which they need to be for VR. That's why you need a very powerful GPU or graphics card to unlock virtual reality applications because everything needs to happen in under 20 milliseconds. So, this is an example of how a new technology virtual reality can really stretch the boundaries of what your computer can do and how it interacts with peripherals. Virtual reality is one of the many things you might be studying later on in your degree, and over the course of your career as a computer scientist, you probably find that many new innovations like these happen that rely on new peripheral devices which allow you to interact with computers in new ways. They will make new challenges for computer scientists to make things that are both usable, and fun to use but also to make sure that they run fast enough to do what they do. They rely on really good hardware, good devices, good peripheral controllers, and also good developers like you who understand how to use them. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 8.1 Communicating with devices Video: Video Peripherals .

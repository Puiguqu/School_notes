## VIDEO TRANSCRIPT ## You may navigate through the transcript using tab. To save a note for a section of text press CTRL + S. To expand your selection you may use CTRL + arrow key. You may contract your selection using shift + CTRL + arrow key. For screen readers that are incompatible with using arrow keys for shortcuts, you can replace them with the H J K L keys. Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key When we think of an operating system, we normally think of something a bit like this, the graphical user interface. This is the visual side of the operating system and it's really important. It's a vital part of the OS, but there's a lot more going on in an operating system than what you can see. When we talked about applications, we saw that they consist of, yes, some code in the executable file. But also a lot of other stuff like libraries that add extra functionality and resource files that are not code, but are part of the application. But we also found out there's a lot going on in the operating system that is supporting the application. And we looked at device drivers which give access to the hardware and other functions like networking and graphics. There's actually quite a lot happening in that operating system, lets have a look at that in detail. We have an application and we've got an operating system. And there's actually something that's a little bit in between called a utility. Utilities are actually applications but they are little mini applications that are bundled with the operating system. So for example, my operating system has a calculator and a calendar and the ability to set the time. All of these things are utilities that are very standard but are not quite part of the operating system itself. As I said, the most obvious thing you get with the operating system is the GUI, the graphical user interface. That's partially the GUI of the operating system itself. So, it's things like the menus and the dock here which is listing all the applications. But the operating system also supports the graphical user interface of individual applications. So for example, this window contains my browser, and it's supplied by the Window manager. The Window manager is the part of the operating system that provides space on screen. These rectangles in which the application happens. The operating system can also supply stuff within the application. So you've got these little user interface switches like buttons or text entry boxes that are supplied by a GUI library. Now, this might be a third party library but very often the GUI library and those basic button functionalities are provided by the operating system. Or at least live leads that are associated with the operating system. So there's quite a lot going on in the graphical user interface of the operating system and that relates closely to applications. So we can see the user interface of the operating system and we can see the utilities. Little applications that bundled with the operating system itself, but deep down in the operating system there's something else called the kernel. Now the kernel is the fundamental core of the operating system and it's what provides some of the most important functionality like access to hardware, networking and files. And we're going to find out a little bit more about that in this topic. One of the most important skills you're going to learn as a computer scientist is programming. Essentially, this means writing code that makes software work. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 9.0 Introduction Lesson 9.1: What is an operating system?

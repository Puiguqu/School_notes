Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key So, you've seen that an operating system provides a user interface, the GUI, and some many utility applications. But at a deep level there's the Kernel. The core of the operating system that provides fundamental services to be used by all of the applications. So, what kind of services does the Kernel provide? What does it do? You've seen one example previously in this course which is device drivers. You've seen how applications often need to connect to bits of hardware like printers. It will be very inefficient if every single application had to include codes to interact with every single different type of printer. So, we have drivers which are little bits of software that the applications used to communicate with printers. Each driver knows how to communicate with its own printer. But they all provide the same basic interface to all applications. So, the applications can communicate with the printers in exactly the same way even though each printer is different. The same goes for most kinds of peripheral device. The operating system Kernel manages the drivers. The Kernel provides a standard interface to all the applications and behind the scenes it communicates with the drivers which interact with the hardware itself. So, that's one really important function of the operating system Kernel, managing device drivers. But there's more and a lot of it is also about interacting with hardware. I'm going to talk about two really important bits of hardware in your computer that we've seen before. Mass storage and main memory. Mass storage is devices like hard disks and other media which permanently store files. Main memory is temporary storage where data is stored for use by an application. We're going to look at how the operating system provides the interface to both of these. First, let's talk about mass storage. When data is stored to disk it's stored as files whether it's text, pixel images or audio. Those files are managed by the operating system with a function called the file manager. The file manager looks after the files themselves and it also looks after the metadata of the files. So, it stores other information about like the date or the owner as we've seen before. You might be familiar with seeing files represented in your graphical user interface like this. This is the interface to the file manager. But the file manager itself is the software that manages how files and the metadata is stored on disk. Now the nice thing about the file manager is it's not just for files, it also looks after folders. Folders are also called directory's. The two terms are used interchangeably. So, whenever I say directory thing folder whenever I say folder think directory. Now a folder contains files, so for instance my writing folder contains a bunch of documents. It's a way of grouping files together and the great thing is folders can also contain other folders and this creates a hierarchy. So, I can have a folder for this particular course how computers work and inside that folder I can have another folder for this particular lesson. Well I stole all my slides and scripts. That's a really nice way for me to organize all my work files on the computer. The file manager provides all that organization. Behind the scenes it's not just my own document files that are organized this way. Its is the files that make up applications and the files that make up the fundamental operating systems in cells. So, you can have a look on your computer and see how all these file structures are organized and they'll be different for different operating systems. The other main function of the operating system is to look after memory. Each application needs to have some memory for it to function. That's where it stores all the data it's working on. So, when an application starts the operating system or in this case the part of the operating system called the memory manager, allocates some memory. Or rather gives it a range of memory addresses that it can work with. Other applications also have their own areas of memory. What you don't want to happen is for one application to interfere with the memory of another application. Particularly if the first application is a virus that's trying to mess up all your other programs. So, the operating system can stop one application accessing the memory area of another application to make sure that they're not messing with each other. So, that's a core function of the memory manager, allocating memory to applications and making sure that one application can't interfere with the memory of another application. But what happens if the memory fills up and the new application starts or an application asks for more memory? Well, the operating system does something clever. As well as main memory, we've got a hard disk. In general we've got a lot more hard disk space than we have memory space. So, the memory manager takes an application that's maybe not active at the moment it's running but you're not doing anything with it and it moves the memory area for application from main memory onto the hard disk. So, it still loaded, all the data is there, it can be reloaded into memory whenever you like but it's stored on the hard disk. The data will be slower to access but it frees up space for other applications. The process of copying memory to hard disk is called paging. A page is a chunk of memory attached to an application that saved to disk. When we use this spaces as memory we call it virtual memory. Is not really memory, it's disc space but it is called virtual memory because the disc space is acting as if it was memory. So, there we have some of the many functions of an operating system. I can't list all of them in a lecture like this but some of the most important ones are interacting with hardware whether it's device drivers or the file manager that looks after files on disk or the memory manager that looks after your memory hardware. All of these functions provide basic services that applications need over time. Can you think of or find out about any other services that the operating system provides to applications? ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 9.0 Introduction Lesson 9.1: What is an operating system?

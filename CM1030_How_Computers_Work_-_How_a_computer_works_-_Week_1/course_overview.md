### Abstraction Video• . Duration: 4 minutes 4 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, focusing on the most important concepts and findings:

A computer's workings are inherently complex due to the involvement of quantum mechanics in semiconductor chips. The number of mathematical operations on a computer can be measured in gigahertz (billion operations per second) and stored in gigabytes (billions of numbers). Due to this complexity, no one can fully understand how a computer works. To address this limitation, the concept of abstraction is introduced. Abstraction refers to simplifying complex information by focusing on key features rather than detailed representations.

In art, abstraction can be seen in works that emphasize certain aspects over realistic details. In engineering, abstract diagrams are used to simplify complex mechanisms, making them easier to understand. The goal of abstraction in computer science is to distill complex computer operations and data into a more manageable form.

However, abstraction does not mean losing accuracy; rather, it involves choosing which features to highlight while simplifying others. This process allows humans to grasp the essential aspects of a system without getting overwhelmed by excessive detail. To facilitate this understanding, computer scientists use abstraction as a fundamental concept in computing.

Abstraction is essential for explaining how computers operate, especially when discussing quantum mechanics and complex hardware components like CPUs and memory. By simplifying these topics through abstraction, researchers can make complex ideas more accessible to a broader audience.

### Abstraction in data representations Video• . Duration: 4 minutes 4 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

The concept of abstraction in computer science refers to a simplified representation of software or technology that focuses on essential details while ignoring complexity. Abstraction helps us understand computers by providing a way to think about complex systems in simpler terms. In the context of video, it can be represented as electrical charges, magnetization, tiny pulses of light, or electromagnetic waves. However, regardless of the physical representation, the essence of the video remains the same. To simplify this concept, we can represent things as numbers, which is a fundamental abstraction used in computer science. A computer picture is composed of a grid of pixels, each with a color that can be represented by three numbers (red, green, and blue). This allows us to build abstractions such as pixels and colors, which are easier to understand than the raw data. By simplifying further, we can represent the video as a sequence of pictures, making it more accessible for different applications. The layers of abstraction provide a hierarchical structure, with each layer being simpler and more abstract than the one beneath it. This structure allows us to build complex systems from simpler ones, making them easier to understand and use. Abstraction is crucial in computer science, as everything learned will often be more complex than how it's described. The simple abstract version will be easier to understand and more useful for most applications. In this course, we will explore various abstractions and their applications in computer science.

### Notional machines Video• . Duration: 4 minutes 4 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

The concept of abstraction is crucial in computer science as it allows for simplification of complex systems. Abstraction can be represented in various ways, including art and representation of video on a computer. Computers are not just for storing data, but also for performing actions, making abstraction a necessary tool to understand these actions.

In the context of software, abstraction refers to the representation of complex actions as simple machines, known as notional machines. A notional machine is a simplified version of a software's functionality that captures its essence without considering the complexity of the underlying code. The video player is an example of a software that can be represented using a notional machine.

A video player involves transmitting and receiving data over the internet, decoding compressed video, processing it, and displaying it on screen. However, when using a video player, we don't need to consider these details; instead, we think of it as a simple abstraction. The video itself can be represented as a sequence of pictures laid out along a timeline.

A playhead is used to identify the current position in the video, and moving forward along the timeline automatically plays the next image. This concept forms the basis of a notional machine for a video player. Notional machines are useful for controlling software by ignoring its complexity and capturing its essence.

The rest of the course will explore creating notional machines for various types of software and learning building blocks to apply to these machines.

### CPU and memory Video• . Duration: 3 minutes 3 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

A notional machine is a simplified model used to understand specific applications or software. It can be useful for beginners, as it provides a basic understanding of how computers work. The most important component of a computer is the central processing unit (CPU), which performs calculations and runs instructions that make up code. The CPU is the core of the computer, responsible for executing instructions. Another vital component is random access memory (RAM), where data is stored while being processed by the CPU. Data is sent from RAM to the CPU, processed, and then written back to RAM. This interaction between the CPU and RAM is a fundamental aspect of how computers work. When editing a document in a word processor, most of the data remains in RAM, with only specific parts loaded into the CPU for processing. The CPU performs tasks such as adding or deleting characters, which are then written back to the document in memory. Other devices like screens, keyboards, hard disks, sound cards, and speakers also play crucial roles in a computer's functioning. When starting a new song on an audio player, data is loaded from the hard disk into RAM, processed by the CPU (if necessary), and sent to the sound card for playback. Modern computers often feature direct memory access, which bypasses the CPU and directly copies data from memory to the sound card, freeing up the CPU for other tasks. This simplification allows us to understand complex processes in a more manageable way. Notional machines are useful because they provide a basic understanding of how real computers work, despite being simplified models.

### Notional machines – lecture summary Reading• . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Abstraction is a fundamental concept in computer science that simplifies complex systems by representing them in a more understandable form. Abstraction helps users understand and control complex software without needing to know all the underlying complexities. A notional machine is a simplified model that captures the essential actions of a complex software system. The video player notional machine involves a timeline, playhead, and actions such as playing, pausing, and stopping. The timeline represents the sequence of images in the video, while the playhead indicates the current position. Playing automatically moves the playhead forward to display the next image, and pausing and stopping halt the movement of the playhead. Users can click on the timeline to move to a different position in the video using the notional machine. Notional machines are used to simplify and understand software actions, and to apply the concept to various software applications. Throughout the course, students will learn to build notional machines for different software applications. The key skills and concepts related to notional machines include identifying and creating abstractions, using notional machines to simplify software actions, and applying notional machines to various software applications. Understanding representational abstraction and action abstraction is also important. Students should be familiar with how videos can be abstracted as sequences of images and the functions of a video player as a notional machine. Notional machines play a crucial role in simplifying the use and understanding of software, making it easier for users to interact with complex systems. By using notional machines, users can better understand and control complex software without needing to know all the underlying complexities.

## Week 10

### Operating system security Video• . Duration: 7 minutes 7 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

1. Operating systems have a crucial role in protecting data from unauthorized access.
2. The most basic security function provided by an operating system is a login, which ensures that only authorized users can access the computer.
3. However, with multiple users sharing a computer, it's essential to restrict what each user can do, such as accessing other people's files.
4. To achieve this, there are two levels of access: ordinary users and administrators (also known as superusers or root users).
5. Ordinary users have limited rights, including the ability to use applications and change personal data, but not access other users' files or make changes to the computer.
6. Administrators, on the other hand, have complete control over the computer, including installing applications, adding new users, and deleting user accounts.
7. The operating system uses a concept called memory management to prevent one application from accessing the memory space of another.
8. To achieve this, the operating system has two levels of machine instructions: Privileged Instructions and regular instructions.
9. Privileged Instructions are restricted to privileged code, such as the kernel of the operating system, and can only be executed by authorized processes.
10. Regular instructions, on the other hand, can be executed by any process and do not have access to privileged memory areas.
11. The CPU's hardware enforces these privilege levels, preventing unauthorized code from accessing privileged instructions.
12. Security in operating systems is built into both the software (operating system) and hardware (CPU).
13. Understanding how operating systems secure data and prevent unauthorized access is essential for managing computers and networks.
14. Malware protection is a critical aspect of operating system security, and users must be aware of the risks and take steps to protect themselves.
15. The lesson discusses the importance of operating system security and provides resources for further learning, including videos, readings, and practice assignments.

### Mid-term quiz key concepts checklist Reading• . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

Here is a summary of the provided text in 15 sentences:

The study guide outlines essential skills, concepts, and knowledge required to complete the 'How Computers Work' mid-term exam. The exam assesses topics from basic computer operations to advanced concepts like encryption, dynamic libraries, and memory management. Encryption prevents unauthorized access to private files by converting data into a coded format.

Dynamic libraries differ from executables, resources, and user files as they contain code used by applications but are not part of the main executable. Memory addresses define a specific cell in memory and play a crucial role in identifying it.

The system bus connects peripheral devices (e.g., keyboards, mice) to hardware components that control device input and output. Domain names differentiate from IP addresses, email addresses, and hexadecimal numbers, playing a key role in web addresses.

Utilities are small software programs designed for specific tasks like disk formatting, and the MEMLOAD instruction transfers data between main memory and registers. Computer security is important as certain types of malware fail due to restrictions on background processes, privileged instructions, and administrator access.

File size comparisons show that uncompressed images can represent a large number of words compared to text. Data compression techniques, such as run-length encoding, are used to compress images that can be easily compressed using this method.

The study guide covers key concepts and skills required for the mid-term exam, including encryption, dynamic libraries, memory management, peripheral devices, domain names, utilities, MEMLOAD instruction, computer security, file size comparisons, and data compression techniques. The final assessment includes a summative quiz and coursework submission.

### Mid-term quiz key concepts review Reading• . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences:

Encryption converts data into a coded format to prevent unauthorized access. This ensures that only those with the correct decryption key can read the information, protecting sensitive data from hackers. Dynamic libraries are collections of code that applications use at runtime but are not included in the main executable file. This allows for modular programming and efficient memory usage, as the same library can be used by multiple programs simultaneously.

Memory addresses are unique identifiers for specific locations in a computer's memory. They allow the CPU to access and manipulate data stored at that location efficiently. Peripheral devices like keyboards and mice connect to the system bus via device controllers, which manage communication between the peripheral and the CPU.

Domain names are human-readable addresses used to access websites, mapping to numerical IP addresses assigned to each device on a network. Domain names are easier for humans to remember and use. Utilities are small software programs designed to perform specific tasks like disk formatting, file management, and system diagnostics.

These tools help maintain and optimize computer performance. The MEMLOAD instruction loads data from main memory into a register, crucial for data manipulation and processing within the CPU. Computer security measures, such as background processes, privileged instructions, and administrator access, prevent malware from operating unnoticed.

File size comparisons can be made by comparing an uncompressed image of 896x1024 pixels to text, which is roughly equivalent in file size. Run-length encoding is a simple compression technique effective on images with large areas of uniform color. By mastering these concepts and skills, students will be well-prepared to complete the 'How Computers Work' mid-term exam.

### History of operating systems Video• . Duration: 6 minutes 6 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

The first fully operational computer was built at the University of Cambridge, called EDSAC, designed by Maurice Wilkes. Wilkes taught the author, who also highlighted Alan Turing's contributions to building ACE, another early computer. Turing was a genius in laying mathematical foundations for computing and developing AI ideas. John Von Neumann, J Presper Eckert, and John Mauchly in the US laid technical foundations for computers, influencing Wilkes and Turing's machines. Early computers lacked operating systems, with users signing up for time slots to use them. The introduction of punched cards allowed programmers to input programs into computers. Programmers made holes in the card at positions representing machine instructions, which were then interpreted by the computer. For fast results, massive computers with screens and keyboards (terminals) were needed in the 1970s. These terminals linked users to main computers for multi-processing or timesharing. The concept of sharing primary computers is still relevant today, such as when websites share a server. Timesharing remains necessary due to running multiple applications on shared CPUs. Modern computers have multiple CPUs (multi-core), but still require load balancing to efficiently allocate tasks. Load balancing is crucial in managing computer programs and optimizing computing resources. The development of operating systems focuses on managing computer programs and allocating tasks to CPUs efficiently.

### Processes Video• . Duration: 4 minutes 4 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

A standard single-core CPU can only handle one instruction at a time. However, modern computers can run multiple applications simultaneously by using processes, which are coherent pieces of software that can run independently of other processes. Each process has its own memory space allocated by the memory manager, but they do not share the same memory as other processes. There is also a concept called threads, which have similar properties to processes but share memory with other threads. Processes allow multiple tasks to appear as if they are running simultaneously, even though they actually run one after another due to time slicing.

The CPU runs each process for a certain amount of time, known as a time slice, before sending an interrupt to the next process. This interrupts the current process and allows it to yield control to the next process. The order in which processes run is not always predictable, but can be influenced by factors such as priority and I/O operations.

High-priority processes are given more frequent time slices, allowing them to respond faster to user input. Meanwhile, low-priority processes wait for their time slice to finish before continuing. When a process needs data from disk, it yields control to other processes until the data is available, which can significantly slow down its execution. This highlights the trade-off between CPU performance and I/O operations.

The process switching mechanism allows multiple tasks to appear as if they are running simultaneously, giving modern computers their ability to multitask. Despite this apparent simultaneity, each process still executes one instruction at a time due to the limitations of the single-core CPU architecture.

### Process simulation Reading• . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences:

The next activity is a simulation game where you play the role of an operating system process manager, tasked with selecting which processes to run on a computer. The game shows various processes that might run on a typical computer, including a word processor, video player, email client, web browser, and cloud sync process. Your job is to choose which process to run by clicking on it, turning the selected process green.

When a process is waiting for a resource, it will have "WAITING" written before its status. You should not select these processes to run as there is no benefit. On the other hand, if a non-waiting process is left idle for too long, the application may become slow and unresponsive to the user.

The goal of the game is to prevent this from happening by selecting the correct processes to run at any given time. If a yellow process remains idle for an extended period, it will seem unresponsive to the user and turn red, resulting in a loss of the game.

To succeed, you must balance the needs of each process and ensure that no single process is left idle for too long. This requires careful consideration of each process's status and requirements. The simulation game provides a realistic scenario for understanding the importance of resource allocation in operating systems.

Overall, the goal of the simulation game is to practice coordinating the machine's activities and making decisions about which processes to run on a computer. By completing this activity, you will gain a better understanding of how operating systems manage resources and prioritize tasks.

## Week 12

### Semaphores Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

The concept of processes is introduced, allowing multiple tasks to run simultaneously on a computer. However, up to now, each process has been considered independent, with its own memory area and no interaction between them. When multiple processes need to access the same resource, such as a file or printer, problems can arise. If one process writes to the resource while another is reading from it, data corruption can occur. To solve this problem, locking mechanisms have been introduced, where a process locks a resource when accessing it. However, if two processes try to lock the same resource at the same time, a deadlock can occur.

A deadlock happens when both processes are waiting for each other to unlock their resources, causing an infinite wait. This is a common problem in parallel software, where multiple processes share resources. To avoid deadlocks, special instructions called semaphores have been introduced, which allow one process to lock and unlock a resource simultaneously. Semaphores can help prevent data corruption and ensure that resources are accessed safely.

The concept of threads is also discussed, as they share memory and can lead to similar problems with concurrent access. To solve these problems, locks and semaphores are used to manage shared resources and prevent deadlocks. The introduction of semaphores and locks has improved the safety and reliability of parallel software systems.

### Mobile payments Video• . Duration: 4 minutes 4 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

A computer system needs to handle money processes, which has become increasingly important with digital services and mobile payments. Kenya's M-Pesa system was a pioneering example of mobile payments, allowing users to add and transfer funds using their mobile phones. The system works by sending requests to the M-Pesa servers, where databases record user accounts and balances. A program looks up the balance, adds the transferred amount, and updates the database with a new number.

The servers need to handle many transactions simultaneously, which is achieved through processes. However, if multiple requests are made to the same account, the previous transaction's result may be overwritten, leading to errors. This is where semaphores come in - they ensure that only one process can write to an account at a time, preventing overwrites.

The use of semaphores is crucial in financial systems, such as bank accounts and databases, to prevent simultaneous access without the risk of data loss. The scenario described illustrates the problem of lost transactions due to concurrent access. In practice, concurrency problems like this are common in computer systems that handle multiple requests simultaneously. Mobile payments, such as those made through M-Pesa, rely on the coordination of processes and semaphores to ensure accurate transactions.

The system's architecture is designed to handle millions of users and thousands of transactions daily, with servers creating new processes for each request. The use of semaphores allows the system to manage concurrent access to user accounts and prevent data corruption. The importance of semaphores in financial systems cannot be overstated, as they enable the creation of secure and reliable payment processing systems.

Overall, the use of semaphores and concurrency control mechanisms is essential for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of financial transactions, particularly in systems that handle multiple requests simultaneously.

### Case study debrief Video• . Duration: 3 minutes 3 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

The operating system manages memory allocation to applications, which may need to request additional memory if they load large data. Applications also interact with the file system, using device drivers for graphics, keyboard, mouse, and touchscreen functionality. Processes are essential for concurrent application usage, as the operating system switches between them.

To minimize interruptions, some applications, like a video player, process data directly in memory, while others, such as a note-taking app, load large files into memory at once. The video player may need to access network drivers if streaming from the internet, whereas the note-taking app relies heavily on keyboard drivers. 

The operating system uses processes differently, with the video player constantly performing tasks and requiring frequent interruptions for other applications. In contrast, the note-taking app spends most of its time waiting for user input, only executing when interrupted by the keyboard.

Despite not sharing resources directly, applications may share files or data through separate processes. For example, a note-taking app might sync with a cloud server in a separate process, using the same file.

The design of an application significantly affects how it interacts with the operating system and its performance. The applications discussed in this video likely differ from real-world examples but demonstrate similar principles for interacting with the OS.

Overall, understanding how different applications interact with the operating system is crucial for optimal performance and efficiency.

### Networks Video• . Duration: 6 minutes 6 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

A network is a collection of computers connected together to communicate. Networks can be classified based on their physical connections, such as wired (Ethernet) or wireless (WiFi). However, networks can also be classified based on their size, with Local Area Networks (LANs) connecting computers in close proximity, Wide Area Networks (WANs) connecting across a larger area, and Personal Area Networks (PANS) connecting multiple devices to each other. Clusters are computers networked together to combine power and increase reliability. Networks can be classified based on their topology, with star networks having a central computer connected to peripheral devices, bus networks using a single wire or hub to connect devices, and ring networks having devices connected in a circular configuration.

Switches and routers are used to connect networks of the same type (switches) or different types (routers), respectively. Client-server communication is a common model where individual computers (clients) communicate with a central computer (server). This model is similar to a star network but uses virtual connections rather than physical ones. Peer-to-peer communication, on the other hand, allows individual computers to communicate directly with each other. Network protocols, such as TCP/IP and HTTP, govern how data is transmitted over networks.

LANs are often connected to WANs, which can span across multiple locations or even countries. PANs are typically used for mobile devices and personal use cases. Cluster configurations allow for increased power and reliability by distributing workload among multiple computers. Understanding network architectures, protocols, and topologies is essential for designing and implementing efficient networks.

Note that I've tried to preserve the original text's format and focus on key information, technical details, and important concepts, while also condensing it into 15 sentences.

### Interview Case study: How does a campus network work? Video• . Duration: 3 minutes 3 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

The Goldsmiths campus has a single physical network that connects all desktop computers via Ethernet cables to switches, which are then connected to multiple switches around the campus, ultimately connecting to servers. However, the network is separated into separate Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) using virtual local area networks (VLANs). Each port within a switch can be configured to connect to a different VLAN, allowing separation of services and configuration of the network into segmented areas. Students can connect wirelessly with their own computers by logging in with their Goldsmiths username and password, accessing the Wi-Fi network, which is made up of wireless access points connected to the physical network through separate VLANs. The Goldsmiths network uses Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) for IP address assignment to computers that connect to the physical network. DHCP assigns an IP address within a set range from a DHCP server in response to a computer's request. Some machines may have static IP addresses, which remain unchanged and are useful for servers with fixed addresses. The Goldsmiths network connects to the Internet through the Joint Academic Network (JANET), a network connecting UK education institutions and research institutions. JANET provides internet access by connecting the Goldsmiths network to the wider Internet. The campus network is managed as a single, large physical network but functions within separate VLANs for different services and configurations. The use of VLANs allows for efficient management of the network and separation of services. The Goldsmiths network supports wireless connectivity with students' computers using their usernames and passwords to authenticate access to the Wi-Fi network. Understanding how networks work is crucial, especially in university or corporate settings where networking plays a vital role. Network architectures, including video networks and interview case studies, provide insights into different aspects of network functioning. Network protocols, like DHCP, are essential for managing and configuring the physical network, including IP address assignment to computers connecting to it. 

Note that I've kept the original structure and sentence structure as much as possible while condensing the information into a shorter summary. Let me know if you have any further requests!

### Network protocols Video• . Duration: 6 minutes 6 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

1. Protocols are essential for network communication as they provide rules for computers to follow over networks.
2. Protocols prevent problems that can occur during network communications, such as messages being mixed up or transmitted at the same time.
3. Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) is a protocol implemented in the Ethernet standard to resolve collisions and ensure efficient transmission.
4. Messages are divided into packets, each containing message data and additional information, known as the packet header.
5. Protocols define the information contained within the packet header.
6. When sending a packet over the internet, it must use both the protocols of the physical network being used and the internet protocol (IP) protocol.
7. The IP packet is then encapsulated in another packet for the physical network being used, such as Wi-Fi or Ethernet.
8. Routers remove the IP packet from the physical network packet and re-encapsulate it with a new packet to be sent over the next network.
9. Data is typically transmitted using multiple layers of packets inside other packets, each based on a different protocol.
10. The innermost layer is normally the application layer, which includes protocols such as HTTP for web pages and POP/SMTP for email.
11. The transport layer handles communication between the start point and destination of a message, without worrying about content or networks.
12. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are two examples of transport layer protocols.
13. The network layer handles transmission across multiple networks, including routers, and is almost always implemented using IP protocol.
14. The link layer protocol handles transmission over a single physical network, such as Ethernet or Wi-Fi.
15. Network ports, which are numbers attached to packets, determine where the packet should be sent, allowing software to decide which application to use it with.

Note: I did not include some minor details and examples in this summary for brevity. Let me know if you need anything else!

### TCP and UDP Video• . Duration: 7 minutes 7 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

The internet standard defines two main transport layer protocols: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP). TCP is a reliable protocol that ensures messages get through, while UDP is an unreliable protocol suitable for real-time applications. In the context of mobile payments, TCP establishes a connection between the sender's phone and the recipient's bank to ensure message reliability. The connection is established by sending packets with the "syn" packet to confirm readiness. Once connected, devices can send data, with acknowledgments sent after each packet transmission. To handle large data sets, TCP assigns numbers to packets (e.g., packet 1, packet 2). Acknowledgments always include the packet number for sender verification.

However, if packets get lost or are delayed, TCP's reliance on acknowledgments slows down communication. In contrast, UDP sends packets without acknowledging them and does not resend lost packets. For example, in an online racing game, using TCP would delay gameplay due to frequent acknowledgement requests. Using UDP allows for faster communication, as lost packets can be adjusted during the game.

In summary, TCP prioritizes message reliability over speed, while UDP balances speed with minimal latency. The transport layer ensures that messages reach their destination without considering content, and the application layer handles specific applications' needs, such as ultra-reliable or real-time communication.

## Week 14

### Network security Video• . Duration: 4 minutes 4 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

Networks are vulnerable to numerous security issues, one of which is the potential for packets to be intercepted by malicious computers. To address this issue, network administrators use protocols like HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure), an encrypted version of HTTP that uses encryption algorithms to protect application-layer packets. When using HTTPS, packet encapsulation occurs, where the encrypted packet is wrapped in transport layer and link layer packets for transmission over the network.

When a router receives the packet, it can extract and use the unencrypted network packets but cannot access the encrypted HTTPS packet. The packet only becomes accessible when it reaches its final destination, where the browser has the correct decryption key to read the contents of the packet.

Network security also involves defending against external attacks that aim to disable or compromise a network without gaining direct access to individual machines. One common attack is a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, which involves sending a large volume of network packets to a specific machine or multiple machines on the network, overwhelming them and causing them to become unavailable.

DDoS attacks are often performed using botnets, networks of infected computers that perform the attack without direct human intervention. Since DDoS attacks use valid network traffic, they can be difficult to detect and defend against. Firewalls are commonly used as a defense mechanism, filtering out specific types of packets or blocking IP addresses known to be malicious.

Firewalls can also accidentally block legitimate traffic, causing issues for users. To mitigate this, proxy servers can be implemented, acting as intermediaries between clients and servers or within networks to filter traffic before it reaches its destination. When configured correctly, proxy servers and firewalls provide strong defenses against a wide range of security threats.

However, new security threats are constantly emerging, requiring network administrators to remain vigilant and update their defenses regularly. This is an essential aspect of maintaining network security in the field of computer science. Malware can compromise networks in various ways, including through phishing attacks or exploiting vulnerabilities in software applications.

### Interview Case study: protecting a network Video• . Duration: 2 minutes 2 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

The university network at Goldsmiths faces three main threats: unauthorized access by individuals inside or outside the network, as well as insider threats from employees or students accessing sites and the Internet. To mitigate these threats, the network employs a firewall to block harmful traffic. Firewalls can be used to prevent brute-force attacks, where attackers try to guess usernames and passwords to access servers. Automated systems are in place to identify and block IP addresses of individuals attempting such attacks.

Additionally, authentication is required for all machines connected to the network, which prevents unauthorized access by requiring a valid Goldsmiths username and password. Students learning about network security at Goldsmiths need to understand how the organization protects its networks from various threats.

The transcript also mentions that insider threats can compromise the network through authorized access, making it essential to implement robust authentication mechanisms. The university's firewall is designed to prevent unauthorized access, including brute-force attacks and other malicious activities. By understanding these security measures, students can better appreciate the importance of protecting their own networks in various contexts.

Overall, Goldsmiths has implemented a multi-layered approach to network security, which includes firewalls, authentication mechanisms, and automated systems to detect and block suspicious activity.

### Internet application protocols Video• . Duration: 6 minutes 6 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

The link network and transport layers focus on packet delivery between two ends, while the application layer deals with data content and usage. Email is a client-server application that uses protocols such as Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) for communication between servers. When sending an email, it first goes to the sender's email server, which then sends it to the recipient's email server, where it is downloaded by the recipient. The domain name of the email server is part of the email address, consisting of the identifier and name before the "@" symbol, and the domain name after. Email involves multiple protocols, including POP, IMAP, and Exchange, depending on the client used to fetch and store emails.

The World Wide Web is a classic client-server protocol that uses HTTP (or HTTPS) for communication between clients and servers. When a client requests a web page, it sends an HTTP request with a URL (Universal Resource Locator), which includes the IP address of the server. However, DNS (Domain Name System) protocols are used to convert domain names into IP addresses. The DNS protocol is essential for most Internet communication and involves a single request and reply.

Voice over IP (Internet telephony) is another application that uses peer-to-peer protocols, such as Skype, which sends voice data directly between clients without using a server. However, even in peer-to-peer voice over IP, a server is still needed to connect users. The DNS protocol plays a crucial role in identifying the IP address of a domain name.

The HTTP and World Wide Web are the most commonly used application layer protocols, with HTTPS being the secure version. Email, voice over IP, and web applications all rely on the DNS protocol to convert domain names into IP addresses before establishing communication with servers.

In conclusion, understanding the different layers of Internet communication is crucial for grasping how various applications work. The link network and transport layers focus on packet delivery, while the application layer deals with data content and usage. Email, voice over IP, and web applications all use specific protocols to communicate with servers, relying heavily on DNS protocols to identify IP addresses.

Key concepts:

* Link network and transport layers
* Application layer protocols (SMTP, HTTP, HTTPS)
* Client-server architecture of email
* Peer-to-peer protocols in voice over IP
* Domain Name System (DNS) protocol
* Universal Resource Locator (URL)

Key formulas and technical details:

* URL structure: <protocol>://<domain name>/<path>
* DNS protocol: requests and replies for domain name to IP address conversion
* HTTP request format: GET/<path>?<query parameters>

Note that some of the specific protocols mentioned in the text, such as SMTP, POP, IMAP, and Exchange, are not included in this summary due to space constraints.

### Web servers Video• . Duration: 4 minutes 4 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

The web and HTTP protocol are used to send information between clients and servers. Clients send requests to servers, which then send web pages back using HTML file formats. Early days of the web involved simple URLs that referred to actual files in a file system. However, most websites now use more complex methods to create web pages.

Web pages are often created on the fly by combining a template with data from a database. A template provides the basic layout and formatting, while detailed information is stored in a database. Databases are designed for storing numbers and small amounts of data, so large amounts like videos are typically stored as separate files called assets.

In a database-driven website, a script (e.g., PHP) creates an HTML file by fetching data from a database and combining it with an HTML template. The URL refers to the script and its arguments, which control how the script works. Modern websites use routing engines to interpret URLs and generate web pages, rather than relying on file systems.

The router uses the URL to determine which part of the server program to use, and combines data from a database and a templating engine to create the web page. The templating engine is often separate from the router. This approach allows for greater flexibility and scalability in modern websites.

### Client side interaction Video• . Duration: 2 minutes 2 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Modern websites are not just collections of information that we read passively; they require interaction. The oldest form of interaction on the web is links, which send requests to servers to generate new webpages. However, there aren't enough links for modern websites, especially for dynamic content like videos. Implementing interactions as links would be too slow and inefficient. Instead, client-side interaction is used, where all functionality is implemented in a user's web browser using the JavaScript language. This allows for faster and more responsive interactions.

One example of client-side interaction is templating, which sends templates directly to the client and data separately from the template. The client then combines the two to create the webpage, reducing the amount of data sent by the server. This approach makes the process more efficient and responsive. Another advantage is that the output doesn't have to be HTML, and the client can display it in a different way.

This understanding of client-side and server-side processing is crucial for web development. Client-side interaction allows for flexibility and scalability, making it suitable for mobile apps and other non-web applications as well. The distinction between client-side and server-side processing will be important to learn throughout one's computer science degree.

### Clusters and clouds Video• . Duration: 2 minutes 2 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

A modern web server is often implemented as a cluster, consisting of multiple computers working together to serve a single website. Each computer in the cluster can have different functions, such as routing or database management, sharing tasks with other computers. Virtual servers are software-based servers that can run on a single computer, allowing multiple websites to be hosted on a single machine. There are two ways to implement virtual servers: virtual machines and containers.

Virtual machines implement the machine language of another computer in software, creating an independent computer with its own operating system and application software. Containers share the same operating system kernel as other containers but act like different computers with different application software. Virtual machines can be more efficient than containers if they use the same machine language.

Most websites are now hosted on Cloud services such as Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud, which use clusters and virtual servers to serve multiple websites. These cloud servers consist of huge clusters of computers, each website having one or more virtual servers implemented on a cluster. The web is an essential part of our lives, and its implementation efficiency is crucial.

Complex architectures for web servers are needed to support the high demand for online services. This lecture has only scratched the surface of how modern websites work, but future lessons will delve deeper into this topic. Key concepts include clusters, virtual servers, containers, and cloud computing.

## Week 16

### Servers and databases Video• . Duration: 8 minutes 8 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

A database is a collection of data stored in a structured way, managed by a piece of software called a database management system. A database model represents how the data is represented and accessed, with the relational model being the most common type. The relational model breaks down an item of data into different elements like title, summary, and instructor.

A relational database stores all its data in tables, where each row is a tuple and each column is an attribute. Each cell contains data, which can be text or numbers, but more complex data like photos are typically stored in files and their file names are stored in the database.

To link multiple tables together, a third table called an "enrollments" table is used, with attributes for learners and courses. The enrollments table uses an "id" attribute to identify entries from one table to another, allowing data to be linked between tables.

Relational databases have functions to access data, including SELECT, PROJECT, and JOIN operations. The SELECT operation retrieves data from a particular tuple, while the PROJECT operation extracts only some of the attributes of a table.

The POWER of relational databases is that they allow you to combine multiple tables to create new combined tables, using the JOIN operation. This enables the creation of useful web pages without having to manually design each one.

Databases also enable ordinary web users to contribute to parts of the website by saving their input to the database. This allows for user-generated content and dynamic web pages that can be updated in real-time.

The modern web is made possible by the power of databases, which provide a way to store and manage large amounts of data in a structured and organized manner.

### Interview with Matthew Yee-king about NoSQL Video• . Duration: 6 minutes 6 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

Dr. Matthew Yee-King discussed trends in current web programming, particularly the rise of NoSQL databases. He defined NoSQL as an alternative to traditional relational database models like SQL. NoSQL databases offer flexible data structures such as hierarchical and graph-based models. Dr. Yee-King used MongoDB as a common example of a NoSQL database, specifically a document storage database that stores structured documents in JSON format. This approach allows for easier data modeling and flexibility in storing complex relationships between data elements. In contrast, SQL databases use a flat rows and columns structure. NoSQL databases offer advantages such as the ability to store varied forms of data without a fixed schema. They also enable more flexible searching and indexing methods, but at the cost of potentially reduced efficiency compared to SQL databases. Dr. Yee-King mentioned that one of the key benefits of NoSQL databases is their flexibility in handling complex data structures. He used his own experience building a multiple-choice questioning survey engine as an example of how MongoDB's document-based approach simplified data modeling and querying. Another advantage of NoSQL databases is that they do not require defining a schema before storing data, allowing for more dynamic data models. However, this also means that searching and indexing data can be more complex in NoSQL databases compared to SQL databases. Despite these challenges, Dr. Yee-King noted that NoSQL databases are widely used in modern web development and offer an alternative approach to traditional relational database models. He emphasized the importance of understanding both SQL and NoSQL databases in today's web programming landscape.

Key points:

* NoSQL databases offer flexible data structures such as hierarchical and graph-based models.
* MongoDB is a common example of a NoSQL database, specifically a document storage database that stores structured documents in JSON format.
* NoSQL databases provide advantages such as flexibility in handling complex data structures and dynamic schema-less data modeling.
* However, this also means that searching and indexing data can be more complex in NoSQL databases compared to SQL databases.
* Dr. Yee-King emphasized the importance of understanding both SQL and NoSQL databases in today's web programming landscape.

 Formulae and technical details:

* NoSQL databases use a variety of data models, including:
 + Hierarchical data model
 + Graph-based data model
* MongoDB is a document storage database that stores structured documents in JSON format.
* SQL databases use a flat rows and columns structure.
* NoSQL databases offer flexible searching and indexing methods, but at the cost of potentially reduced efficiency compared to SQL databases.

### Case study debrief: Coursera Video• . Duration: 8 minutes 8 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

Coursera uses HTTPS protocol for secure communication with clients. Coursera runs on Amazon Web Services (AWS), which provides cloud hosting platform for multiple websites. AWS uses serverless architecture to scale resources dynamically. Coursera has a complex architecture that combines various technologies such as network protocols, HTTP, servers, databases, and HTML rendering. The website uses React framework for rendering web pages. Server-side rendering is used initially to render the full page on the server, but client-side rendering is used later to load only changed parts of the page. Coursera uses a combination of both server-side and client-side rendering to optimize performance. Thread pooling is used in the rendering process to improve efficiency. Video compression and transcoding are done using special methods to stream videos efficiently. The website also uses software frameworks for rendering web pages, such as React. HTML templates are sent to clients, and data is sent separately to be combined in the browser to create a web page. Server-side rendering allows powerful servers to do most of the work, while client-side rendering updates web pages with minimal data transfer. Coursera engineers constantly update and improve code to ensure smooth performance. The website's architecture is complex and involves multiple technologies that may not be immediately apparent from using the site.

Note: I've condensed some information to fit the 15-sentence limit while trying to preserve key details, but some technical terms and concepts might still require further explanation or clarification.

## Week 17

### Introduction: Computers that see Video• . Duration: 1 minute 1 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

Recognizing people's faces is an effortless task for humans, but programming a computer to do so proves challenging due to its complexity. Creating a set of rules based on physical characteristics, such as hair color or eye color, would be too broad and could describe many individuals. The task requires identifying unique features, like the shape of a person's nose or chin. However, breaking down this task into smaller details is difficult for computers, making it hard to program them for face recognition. Face recognition is an example of artificial intelligence (AI), which involves tasks that are easily performed by humans but challenging for machines. Machine learning is a technique that can solve many AI problems, including those related to vision and pattern recognition. This technique is revolutionizing what computers can do in terms of recognizing and processing visual data. The goal of machine learning is to enable computers to learn from experience and improve their performance over time. In the context of face recognition, machine learning algorithms can be trained on large datasets of images to identify patterns and features that distinguish one person from another. These algorithms can then be applied to new, unseen images to recognize individual faces. The power of machine learning lies in its ability to handle complex tasks with large amounts of data. However, it also requires significant computational resources and expertise to implement effectively.

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Artificial intelligence (AI) aims to create machines that can replicate human intelligence to perform tasks humans can do but have historically been difficult for machines. The Turing test, invented by Alan Turing, is a measure of AI's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human. However, the test has flaws, as many systems use simple tricks to fool people rather than showing true intelligence. AI has split into various subfields, including computer vision, natural language processing, robotics, and computational creativity.

These subfields have led to significant advancements in tasks such as image recognition, language understanding, and robot manipulation. However, most of these achievements are considered "narrow" or task-specific AI, lacking the general intelligence humans possess. Achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI), which is the ability to perform any intellectual task, remains an open problem.

AI systems have employed various techniques, including logical rules and expert systems, but often struggle with uncertainty and complexity. Machine learning, a different approach, has become widely used, relying on algorithms that enable machines to learn from data and improve their performance over time. Despite this, creating expert systems for tasks like face recognition remains challenging due to the lack of clear rules and understanding of human cognition.

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Machine learning is an approach to programming computers that involves teaching them by giving them examples of what to do. Instead of writing code to solve a task, a machine learning algorithm learns from data to perform a specific function. The algorithm uses statistical methods to analyze the data and adapt its performance over time. Deep neural networks, also known as deep learning, are a type of machine learning that has become increasingly popular due to the availability of large amounts of data and powerful computing resources. However, the underlying algorithms used in deep learning have been around for decades.

Machine learning involves creating statistical programs called models that take an input and produce an output. The model is trained on example data, which includes both inputs and corresponding outputs. The algorithm adapts the details of the model to map inputs to outputs based on the training data. Once trained, a machine learning model can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data.

Machine learning has many applications, including image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition. It can also be used for classification tasks, such as identifying objects in images or determining medical diagnoses. Regression is another type of output, where the algorithm produces continuous values rather than discrete categories. Generative models can create new examples, such as generating music or text.

There are three main types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data to predict outputs. Unsupervised learning involves training a model on unlabeled data to identify patterns or categories. Reinforcement learning involves training a model through trial and error, where the algorithm receives rewards for correct behavior.

Machine learning has become increasingly important in recent years due to advances in computing power and data availability. The field continues to evolve as new algorithms and techniques are developed to improve performance and efficiency.

### Machine learning algorithms Video• . Duration: 6 minutes 6 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Machine learning algorithms are based on statistics and can be mathematical and complex. One simple method for classifying images, such as cats and dogs, is to use the nearest neighbor algorithm. This algorithm selects the most similar example from a set of labeled examples to classify a new image. The number of neighbors used in this algorithm is denoted by K, hence it's called kNN.

The problem with nearest neighbor is that it can be slow and may not work well when two images are very similar. To improve this, we can use more than one neighbor or select only a small number of important examples to compare with.

Another approach is to create a mathematical function called a model to classify data. For example, if dogs are bigger than cats, we can try to classify based on size by using a threshold value. The threshold value is chosen through optimization, which means choosing numbers that give the best results on the training data.

Optimization is a common process used in machine learning algorithms. Most machine learning algorithms combine multiple features together into mathematical functions called models and use optimization to choose the best parameters for these models.

Some examples of machine learning algorithms include kNN, decision trees, and neural networks. These algorithms can be combined with different methods to improve performance, such as using a sophisticated measure of similarity.

Overall, machine learning is based on algorithms that are often complex but can achieve incredible things when given enough data. Understanding the basics of how these algorithms work can provide a good foundation for doing machine learning.

### Data features Video• . Duration: 3 minutes 3 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

A machine-learning model takes an input and produces an output, which can be represented as numbers. This means that any data that can be represented as numbers can be applied to machine learning. Images are typically represented on a computer as a grid of pixels, each with numerical values representing colors. However, small changes in lighting or image positioning can significantly impact pixel values, making this a poor representation for machine learning.

To overcome this, we need a better way to represent images as numbers. In machine learning, low-level features like pixels are often used, but these don't carry much meaningful information on their own. Higher-level features, such as nose length, weight, or first color, may be more suitable for machine learning tasks.

The choice of features can significantly impact the performance of a machine learning model. Certain features may not be enough to distinguish between two classes, while others may provide sufficient information. Feature extraction is an important part of the machine learning process, which involves calculating more meaningful features from raw data.

This can involve writing custom code to extract features, but advances in machine learning have made it possible to learn features themselves. Specialized features, such as edge detection or face recognition, are often used in specific applications. The goal of feature extraction is to improve the performance of a machine learning model by providing more meaningful and relevant data.

Overall, understanding how to represent images as numbers and choose meaningful features is crucial for effective machine learning. By extracting higher-level features from raw pixel data, we can improve the accuracy and efficiency of our models.

### Testing Video• . Duration: 2 minutes 2 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Machine learning models often do not perform as expected or desired, even when they work well. This can make it difficult to determine if a system is working acceptably. A common approach is to evaluate how much of the training data the model classifies correctly. The percentage of correct classifications on the test set is a better indicator of a model's performance in practice. Machine learning works by optimizing the model to perform well on the training data, which can lead to poor performance on new data not seen during training. This is known as overfitting. To mitigate this, it's essential to split the data into a training set and a test set, with a larger training set used for learning. A good starting point is to use a 4:1 ratio of training to testing data. Testing is a crucial part of machine learning, and professionals often use complex methods to evaluate their models. However, simply splitting the data into train and test sets is a good beginning. It's also essential to consider the application context and type of errors that are most critical. For example, in medical tests, it's better to err on the side of caution and recognize a disease incorrectly than miss it altogether. The training set should be large enough to allow the model to learn effectively from the data. Evaluating how well humans perform on a task can also provide valuable insights into machine learning performance. By considering these factors, machine learning practitioners can develop more accurate and reliable models that generalize well to new data.

### State Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

A computer program can be in multiple different states, which affect how it responds to interaction. A state is a temporary configuration of a computer system that affects its behavior. A computer has two primary states: on and off. When a computer is on, it performs various tasks, while when it's off, it doesn't perform any actions. The video player has multiple states, including stopped, playing, pause, buffering, and loading. The state of the video player changes due to user input (play/pause) or internal decisions (buffering/loading). Other software components, such as a word processor, also have states that affect their behavior. A cursor in a word processor can be in three states: absent, typing, and selection. Each state triggers different actions and behaviors. Understanding the states of software is crucial to troubleshooting issues and getting over confusing problems. Software can get stuck in certain states due to internet connection failures or other external factors. This can lead to unpredictable behavior, such as freezing or displaying incomplete data.

### An e-commerce site Video• . Duration: 4 minutes 4 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, focusing on key concepts and findings:

An e-commerce website operates using states, which represent different stages of the user's interaction with the site. The first state is typically the default homepage, where users search for products. This transition to the second state, the search page, involves a change in data stored by the website about the user. Clicking on a product leads to a third state, examining the product details. Adding a product to the shopping cart represents another state change. The shopping cart is often conditional, requiring users to be logged in to proceed. Logging in itself constitutes a separate state, and completing it allows access to the shopping cart. Progressing through states involves entering payment details and choosing delivery options. Each of these steps represents a distinct state, with transitions triggered by user input or server-side transactions. The checkout process is characterized by multiple states, including entering an address, credit card information, and delivery method. Once the payment has been processed, the website confirms the purchase in its final state. In computer science, states are often used to model the behavior of software systems, with each state representing a specific condition or action. The concept of states is fundamental to understanding how computer programs work, particularly those that involve user input and data processing. By analyzing states in software systems, developers can identify inefficiencies and improve system performance.

### Why does turning it off and on again work? Video• . Duration: 3 minutes 3 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Computers and software can be in different states at various levels of abstraction. The state of a cursor in a word processor affects only one detail of a single application. In contrast, the formatting of a document is an example of a state that encompasses multiple features. When typing, the text will match the formatting of the text around the cursor. However, pressing a key can change massively depending on where you are in the text. For instance, pressing the E key creates bold characters in one location and heading font in another. The real state of a word processor is complex, containing many minor features such as selection status, text color, and font size. This complexity arises from how computer memory is set up, which can store billions of numbers. At the most detailed level, a state depends on these numbers, making it astronomical. Most states won't do anything useful or will cause errors, but programs are written to avoid nonsense states. Modern computer programs are complex and impossible to test every possible state. This means that if a program enters an unusable state, recovery is difficult. Networked or Web-based applications can become stuck in strange states due to internet connectivity issues. When this happens, restarting the computer often resolves the issue. The best fix for a strange state is to turn it off and on again. This method works because most programs return to their default state when restarted, forgetting about previous states.

### A notional machine: files Video• . Duration: 6 minutes 6 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

A file is an abstraction of data on a hard disk that can be thought of as a single thing, even if it's just a collection of bits. The operating system presents files as a set of files sitting in a folder, making it easier to understand the data. Files can contain various types of data, such as words, pixels, or audio samples, and have associated metadata that is stored by the operating system. Metadata includes information about the file, such as its creation date and ownership.

The operating system uses metadata to determine which files are open and editable for a user. If two applications try to edit the same file simultaneously, the operating system locks the file to prevent data corruption. When an application opens a file, it sets locked metadata to indicate that the file is being edited. The application then copies the file into memory, resulting in two identical copies of the data: one on the hard disk and one in memory.

As the application edits the file, the copy in memory becomes different from the original on the hard disk. To prevent data loss, the application must save changes to the disk by opening the file again and locking it. The changes are then copied back to the hard disk, resulting in two identical copies of the data: one that has been modified in memory and another that remains unchanged.

If an application crashes while editing the file, the data will be lost unless a backup is saved to the disk. To prevent data loss, applications often check the time of the last modification of the file before making changes. This allows them to detect potential conflicts with other applications working on the same file.

Understanding how files work and their associated metadata can help users troubleshoot common problems and interact effectively with operating systems and applications.

### Modularity Video• . Duration: 2 minutes 2 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Modularity is a fundamental concept in computer science based on abstraction, which allows complex systems to be understood and built by breaking them down into smaller, independent modules. Computer systems are composed of multiple components, such as CPU, memory, hard disks, and displays, which can be split into modules to improve manageability. Software development also employs modularity, where existing elements from operating systems, open-source software, or other developers are utilized to create complex software. A key example of a module is a hardware driver, which interacts with specific hardware components, such as printers or sound cards.

To simplify the development process, drivers are independent of applications and can interact with different hardware components in a consistent manner. This allows application developers to write code that interacts with drivers, while hardware developers only need to write one driver for each hardware component. The benefits of modularity include reduced work for software development and improved compatibility with new hardware releases.

Modularity is essential for understanding software, as it helps identify the individual modules that make up a piece of software. By analyzing these components, developers can improve their notional machine skills and better comprehend complex software systems. Understanding modularity also enables developers to debug and troubleshoot issues more effectively.

In addition to its benefits for software development, modularity is also important in understanding how applications interact with hardware components. The use of drivers and modules allows applications to access various hardware features without requiring customized code for each component. This enables applications to function consistently across different hardware platforms.

The concept of an application is closely related to software that interacts with computers, smartphones, and tablets. Applications can be thought of as instructions or code that tell the CPU what actions to perform on data. The first computers had their programs wired into their hardware, but modern applications are much more complex. They consist of multiple files, including executable files that contain code, drivers that interact with hardware, libraries that provide standard software modules, and resource files that store data and preferences. Applications often use these libraries to access services like Dropbox or Twitter without having to write custom code. These libraries can be integrated into the application code as a single file or as separate dynamic libraries that interact with the main executable file. The user interface library is an example of a standard software module used by many applications to provide a consistent interface across different platforms. Applications also include resource files that contain data and text, such as language-dependent text in menus and icons. These resources are often stored in separate files that can be easily updated or customized without changing the application code. The executable code file is the core of an application, interacting with drivers, libraries, and resource files to perform its functions. Understanding these components is essential to understanding how applications work and how they interact with hardware and software services. Applications are complex systems that can be analyzed by looking at their individual files and components.

### Debugging Video• . Duration: 6 minutes 6 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Debugging is a crucial skill for computer scientists to identify and fix errors in computer programs, known as "bugs." The term "bug" originated in the 1940s when Admiral Grace Hopper found a moth inside a computer. Debugging involves finding the cause of an error and fixing it, which can be challenging. To debug effectively, one must understand the system, look for clues without assumptions, and systematically change variables to isolate the problem.

The first step is to understand the system, including software and hardware components involved in printing a document. Next, look for error messages or signs of trouble from the word processor or printer. Check the print manager software for any error messages or explanations. If there are no error messages, try searching online for help.

To properly debug, change one variable at a time to see if it makes a difference. This can involve printing a different document, closing and reopening the word processor, or trying from another application. If the problem persists after these steps, try restarting the computer, printer, or even turning it off and on again. In some cases, reinstalling drivers may resolve the issue.

Remember to only change one variable at a time to avoid confusion and ensure accurate diagnosis. Another important step is to check the plug, as many errors can be caused by simple oversights like this. Debugging requires patience, persistence, and attention to detail. With practice and experience, anyone can develop this skill, even if not intending to become a computer scientist.

### Looking inside applications Reading• . Duration: 20 minutes 20 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences:

On a Mac, applications appear to be single files due to the operating system's design, but they are actually folders containing multiple files. To view the contents of an application, navigate to the Applications folder and right-click (or hold down Ctrl and click) on the application icon. Selecting 'Show Package Contents' will reveal all the files that make up the application. Windows is less secretive and allows users to view application folders without special action.

Applications are typically stored in the 'C:\Program Files' directory. This directory contains a folder for each installed application, which includes its executable file, resource files, and libraries (represented by .dll files). To examine the components of an application, look at the files within each application's folder. The files should include the executable (.exe) file, resources files, and libraries.

The Mac requires users to take steps to view the contents of an application, while Windows makes this information more accessible. Understanding how applications are structured can be helpful for debugging and troubleshooting issues. The concept of modularity is relevant here, as applications are composed of multiple components that work together.

### The internet Video• . Duration: 7 minutes 7 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

The Internet is a network of networks that connects different networks and allows computers to communicate with each other across these networks. A router connects two networks, forwarding messages from one network to another and translating between network protocols. When sending a message over the Internet, it doesn't just go directly from the sender to the receiver; instead, it's forwarded by lots of routers across many networks before reaching its destination.

Most users connect to local networks in their homes, workplaces, or public spaces like libraries or internet cafes. These networks don't generally communicate directly with each other but are connected via Internet Service Providers (ISPs). ISPs can span whole countries and are often connected to international ISPs called the Internet Backbone.

To send a message over the Internet, a protocol is needed. The Internet Protocol (IP) is used by all computers and routers to communicate, even if they're on different networks or in different countries. This protocol works like an envelope, where the sender's IP address and other information are included to ensure delivery.

When sending an email, the message is put into a virtual envelope called a Packet that includes the recipient's IP address and other information. The packet is then sent to the router, which forwards it to the ISP's protocol packet. This process repeats until the message reaches its destination.

In reality, messages traveling over the Internet often use multiple protocols wrapped up in each other. For example, email uses the send-mail protocol, web pages use the HTTP protocol, and TCP ensures reliable transmission of data. Each of these protocols is wrapped in an IP packet that might be further wrapped in a WiFi packet when sent over WiFi.

Every computer on the Internet has an IP address, which allows routers to know how to reach any other computer on the Internet. However, IP addresses are not user-friendly for humans; instead, URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) make it easy for humans to remember and type in internet addresses. The domain name part of a URL is converted to an IP address using the Domain Name Service (DNS).

When sending emails or accessing websites, messages often travel through email servers or web servers before reaching their destinations. These servers handle large volumes of data and use specific protocols to ensure delivery. Overall, the Internet works because all computers and routers understand the same protocol, allowing them to communicate across different networks and countries.

### Encryption Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

The Internet relies on routers to forward messages between computers, but this also means that any message sent can be read by computers controlled by others. To ensure private online communications, encryption is used to send messages in codes that can only be read by the intended recipient. Encryption involves converting text into an unreadable form using a mathematical algorithm and a key. Julius Caesar's code, which replaced each letter with a letter three places along the alphabet, demonstrates this principle. Modern internet communications use more sophisticated algorithms, but they still convert text into an unreadable format.

Encryption algorithms are designed to be difficult to crack, even with the world's fastest computers. However, encryption is not foolproof, and there are ways to get around it. Phishing attacks can trick users into using the wrong key, while malicious routers can intercept packets sent to a bank or other secure website. To defend against these attacks, certificates are used to validate public keys and ensure they come from trustworthy sources.

Every public key has a certificate that demonstrates its validity, which is issued by trusted security companies. Web browsers can check whether a certificate is valid before using it for encryption. If the certificate is not valid, the browser will display a warning message, indicating that the encryption may be readable by criminals. Encryption is the basis of many defenses against security threats, and understanding how it works is crucial to staying safe online.

---

### Security defences Video• . Duration: 3 minutes 3 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Protecting against security threats requires understanding various types of threats. Viruses and malicious software are combated using antivirus software that scans for known viruses. Firewalls can prevent unauthorized access to computers, while access control restricts who can access a computer or server by requiring login credentials such as usernames and passwords.

Access controls enable different levels of access to ensure privacy and security. For example, a learner may be able to view videos and take quizzes but not edit grades. System administrators and software developers have the ability to make changes to the system, while teachers can only edit course materials and see grades.

Passwords are crucial for access control, but they can be easily guessed by hackers using automated programs. To mitigate this risk, websites often require users to choose unusual passwords with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters and numbers. However, good passwords can be hard to remember, leading people to use easily guessable variations.

To address this issue, two-factor authentication has become increasingly popular, requiring both a password and a code sent via mobile phone to access a site. This approach is more secure than relying solely on passwords. Understanding computer security is essential to avoid taking unnecessary risks online.

### Networks and the web Video• . Duration: 4 minutes 4 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

The web is a network technology that fundamentally relies on communication over networks. Websites are accessed through organizations' web servers, which hold information used by many people via different clients (computers or software). Communication between clients and servers occurs through packets sent using the Internet Protocol (IP) and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). HTTP is a protocol that allows for the transfer of data over IP. To access a website, a client (such as a web browser) sends an HTTP request packet to a server, which includes a URL consisting of "HTTP", domain name, and query string. The query string allows websites to create pages tailored to individual requirements. When a server receives a query, it sends back a web page, which is typically too large for single packets, so it's split into multiple packets. Some elements like pictures are sent separately from text. Modern websites are networked applications that rely on transferring packets across the Internet between clients and servers. The client sends HTTP requests, and the server responds with web pages. The web uses IP to enable communication over the Internet and HTTP as a protocol to transfer data between servers and clients. A query string is used to specify requirements for website content. Web search engines use query strings to create results tailored to individual needs. The web's functionality relies on state, modularity, networks, security, and client-server communication.

### Clients and servers Video• . Duration: 3 minutes 3 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Websites are modular applications that rely on various components working together. The two primary modules are the client (your computer and web browser) and the server (the website's computer and software running on it). A basic web server consists of one or more web pages, each represented by one or more HTML files. When a request comes in, one page is sent to the client. Modern websites are more complex, with web pages created only when needed in response to specific requests.

Databases are software platforms designed to store data in a structured way that's easy to access for computers. They're efficient for getting data from a database but challenging to add new data. Social media sites store user information, such as name, age, and gender, in databases. The server uses templates with formatting for web pages (e.g., social media profiles) and combines them with data from the database.

The template page contains empty spaces that are filled with data from the database. Webpage formatting is done using HTML and CSS files. Almost everything on a website is a combination of pre-designed templates and dynamically generated content from databases. The interaction between web servers, databases, and browsers demonstrates the modular nature of websites. A server doesn't just store webpages; it creates them using templates and databases.

Understanding these interactions is crucial for becoming a web developer or effectively using websites. Databases make it possible to extend website information without creating new pages. This highlights the importance of modularity in software development, as seen in the complex interactions between web servers, databases, and browsers.

### Data storage Video• . Duration: 7 minutes 7 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

The main memory of a computer stores information that is currently being used, whereas mass storage holds data permanently. Main memory uses microchips called Random Access Memory (RAM) to store information, while mass storage is achieved through various technologies such as hard disks, optical drives, and flash storage. Microchips handle bits, which can represent true or false values. The simplest operation on a bit is flipping it, making it its opposite. More complex operations combine two bits, such as AND, which produces an output of one if both inputs are one, but zero otherwise. A flip-flop circuit can store information by receiving a one on its top input, resulting in a one output that remains even when the input stops. This circuit is the basis of main memory chips. Mass storage devices vary widely, including hard disks, optical drives, and flash storage. SSDs (solid-state drives) are slower than RAM but much faster than traditional hard disks. Optical drives are slow to write to, making them suitable for permanent archiving rather than frequently changing documents. The tradeoff between storage capacity, power usage, and speed is significant in computer design. Modern computers often employ multiple types of storage, such as SSDs and hard disks, to balance these competing factors. Cloud storage offers massive hard disk space and guaranteed data retention, but at the cost of slower access times. Additionally, some main memory systems include a cache, which stores frequently accessed data for rapid retrieval.

### Why does my computer slow down if I open a big file? Video• . Duration: 2 minutes 2 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

The main memory is much faster than hard disks, which can slow down the loading of large files into an application. When a large file is loaded, it can freeze the application due to the slower speed of hard disks compared to main memory. However, this is not the only reason for slowing down after loading a large file; even if the file's loaded, the operating system may still be slowed down by other applications or processes using up all available main memory. When main memory becomes full, virtual memory is used to save some of the data to hard disk storage in an area called virtual memory. Virtual memory tries to minimize the amount of data stored in it that would otherwise be needed immediately. However, hard disks and virtual memory are much slower than real memory, which can slow down applications when using files stored in virtual memory. Upgrading memory is generally cheaper and easier than upgrading processors, making it a more cost-effective solution for slowing down issues caused by insufficient main memory. The operating system uses algorithms to decide what data should be stored in virtual memory, prioritizing the most critical or frequently used data over others. When an application runs out of main memory, it can switch between different applications and processes to find available space before loading a new file into memory. However, if the load is too large, the operating system may not have enough time to process the switch before loading the new file into virtual memory. If this happens repeatedly, it can cause an application or entire system to freeze due to the slow speed of hard disks and virtual memory. This slowdown can be mistaken for a processor problem but is often caused by insufficient main memory. The amount of data that needs to be stored in virtual memory depends on various factors such as the size of the file being loaded, how much RAM is available, and other processes competing for resources.

### Bytes and numbers Video• . Duration: 4 minutes 4 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Bits are simple representations that can be used for various types of data. To represent more complex data, bits must be combined together. In modern computers, memory is addressed in larger chunks, such as bytes, which are eight bits. Bytes are the standard measure of memory and are often too small to access directly on a computer. The smallest element that can be accessed is typically 64 bits or 8 bytes. This may seem inefficient, but accessing data in 64-bit chunks speeds up the computer.

A byte can represent 256 different patterns of ones and zeros called bit patterns, each representing something different, such as letters, numbers, or colors. Numbers are useful because they can be used to represent other types of data. In the decimal system, each place value is multiplied by a power of 10, while in binary, each place value is multiplied by a power of 2. Binary notation can be used to represent decimal numbers as a pattern of bits.

A single byte can only represent up to 255 numbers, but most computers use 32-bit or 64-bit representations, which can handle much larger numbers, including positive and negative values, as well as fractions. Numbers are the fundamental building block of everything on a computer and will be used as the basis for understanding other data representations.

The decimal system is based on powers of 10, while binary is based on powers of 2, but both use place value to represent numbers. This concept can also be applied to other types of data, such as letters, images, and sounds. Understanding how bits, bytes, and numbers work together is essential for grasping computer science concepts.

### Other types of data Video• . Duration: 6 minutes 6 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) is a standard for representing texts that includes all English alphabet letters, numbers, and special characters in seven bits. However, this standard does not accommodate languages like French or German, which have accents, and excludes the majority of the world's population. A new standard called Unicode can represent almost any writing system and is extensible to include other writing systems. Many computer systems still use ASCII, but it is being replaced by Unicode. Text and numbers are a common combination in computer data, such as web pages, spreadsheets, and corporate databases. Images and sounds can also be represented as complex data. Pixels, or picture elements, make up images, with millions of pixels in modern pictures. Brightness is typically represented by eight bits, creating shades between black and white. Colors are created using three numbers (red, green, and blue) and a fourth number for transparency (alpha). The alpha channel allows for transparent images, where an alpha value of 0 means complete transparency. Videos are created by having sequences of images, which can be built from simple bits. Audio is represented as a series of microscopic changes in air pressure recorded as numbers, typically over 44,000 times per second. Sound files are made up of individual samples, and videos can include millions of numbers, making them large data files that can fill up memory chips and hard disks. Understanding how data is represented is crucial for computer performance, especially when working with complex data like images and audio. As a computer scientist, it's essential to understand data representation and design new representations to optimize data storage and processing.

## Week 6

### Compression Video• . Duration: 7 minutes 7 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Compression algorithms are used to reduce the size of large files such as images and videos to make them more efficient for storage and transmission over the internet. Data compression works by representing data in a more efficient way without losing important information. Most data representations are redundant, meaning they use more bits than necessary to represent something. This redundancy can be exploited to compress data. For example, words like "the" or "and" can have very short codes of just two or three bits while rarer words have longer codes.

Compression algorithms can be lossless, which preserves the original information without losing any data, or lossy, where some data is lost to achieve better compression. Lossy compression is often used for images and audio because it can produce much better results than lossless compression, even with minimal data loss. However, lossy compression means that compressing and decompressing files multiple times can degrade the quality of the image or audio.

Run-length encoding (RLE) is a simple technique used to compress pixel values by storing only the number of consecutive identical pixels instead of each individual pixel value. RLE can be very effective for images with mostly white or black backgrounds, but it's not suitable for complex images. More sophisticated compression algorithms are needed for photographs and audio.

These algorithms transform data into a new representation that is easier to find redundant information in, such as transforming image frequencies. Lossy image, audio, and video algorithms can achieve much better compression by making the image representation more redundant while losing some information. The amount of data loss is not always noticeable, especially for everyday uses like putting an image on a webpage.

However, it's essential to remember that lossy compression does lose information, which means that repeated compressing and decompressing can degrade image or audio quality. In some cases, like archiving vintage photographs, lossless compression is preferred to ensure the highest quality possible. Compression algorithms also take time, especially when loading and using compressed files.

In conclusion, data compression is an essential technique for reducing file sizes and making data transmission more efficient. Understanding how compression algorithms work and their trade-offs between quality and size is crucial in computer science applications.

### Interview: MP3 format Video• . Duration: 6 minutes 6 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

MP3 is a file format that allows for compact storage of audio files, such as music or speech. The impact of MP3 on music distribution was significant, enabling rapid sharing and large collections of music to be stored on computers. MP3 uses lossy compression, which reduces the size of the file by throwing away information that humans cannot perceive acoustically. Psycho-acoustic models are used in MP3 compression to determine what sounds can be safely discarded. The model takes advantage of human hearing limitations, such as difficulty distinguishing between low-frequency sounds in different channels. Frequencies above a certain threshold can mask lower frequencies, allowing for further compression. The psycho-acoustic model also considers loud sounds masking quiet sounds, enabling targeted information removal. Despite being lossy, MP3 is often indistinguishable from uncompressed formats when played back through high-quality playback systems. However, the loss of information means that some audio data may not be recoverable in the future. MP3 has been widely used by musicians and music researchers for sharing examples and accessing a wider range of music. The format was instrumental in opening up online music distribution, allowing users to access previously inaccessible content. Lossy compression can also have disadvantages, such as reduced sound quality when files are compressed to their smallest size. Despite this, the benefits of MP3 have made it a widely adopted standard for audio file sharing and storage. In some cases, archiving audio data may require lossless formats for long-term preservation.

### CPU simulation Reading• . Duration: 15 minutes 15 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences:

The interactive simulation will teach how a CPU executes machine instructions by playing the part of the CPU. The simulation consists of a help text at the bottom, guides the user through each stage, and has registers on the right side. Registers are used to store values, and entering a value into a register requires pressing "return". Most instructions involve putting numbers into registers or using existing register values. Register numbers range from 0 to 7, but users should not use the actual values in the operands. Each turn, the user needs to press "Fetch Instruction" to get a new instruction. The instruction is fetched at the memory address in the programme counter. In most cases, the programme counter updates automatically, so no changes are needed. However, when using a JUMP instruction, the programmer must set the programme counter address manually. The MEMLOAD instruction loads data from memory by entering the memory address into the address field and pressing "Fetch". The value appears next to the Fetch button, which can be copied into a register. The MEMSTORE instruction writes values back to memory by putting the memory address in one field and the store value in another, then pressing "return" or "Store" if correct.

Here are some important details:

* Registers 0-7 are used for operands.
* Programme counter updates automatically, unless using JUMP instructions.
* MEMLOAD instruction loads data from memory by fetching at a specific address.
* MEMSTORE instruction writes values back to memory by storing in one field and pressing "Store" if correct.

Overall, the simulation focuses on understanding how a CPU executes machine instructions, including loading and storing data from memory.

### Case study: virtual reality Video• . Duration: 8 minutes 8 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Virtual reality (VR) is an interactive technology that surrounds users with a virtual world. The headset, which connects to the computer via HDMI cable, provides a display similar to a screen. However, it also has a USB 3.0 connector, allowing for power and data transfer. The headset sends information back to the computer via USB, tracking head movement and sending data about it.

Touch controllers are used to interact with virtual objects in VR space, allowing users to grab and manipulate virtual objects as if they were real. These controllers use Bluetooth protocol to connect to the headset wirelessly, rather than being wired to the computer. The connection is proprietary, ensuring fast communication between the controllers and the headset.

VR places strong demands on speed, requiring immediate updates when turning the head or moving in space. This can cause nausea, known as simulator sickness, if the delay is too long. Computers have made significant progress in processing power, allowing for instantaneous updates to be displayed within 20 milliseconds. 

The graphics processing unit (GPU) handles high-quality computer graphics required for VR, working in a parallel manner to ensure fast rendering. A powerful GPU or graphics card is necessary to unlock virtual reality applications that require rapid communication between devices.

VR relies on new peripheral devices that enable users to interact with computers in novel ways, creating challenges for computer scientists to balance usability, fun, and performance.

### Case study debrief Video• . Duration: 6 minutes 6 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

The code being analyzed is written in C and consists of simple instructions that demonstrate how code works on a CPU. The first line adds two numbers together using an add instruction, which operates on registers (e.g., register three stores value one). The arithmetic logical unit performs the addition, saves the result back into register five, and then stores variable i back into memory. The next line is an if statement implemented by conditional jump, comparing the value of variable i with 100 in register zero. If equal, it jumps to code implementing "i equals zero." Otherwise, it moves to the "here" instruction. Variable i is set using a move operation and stored back in memory.

The final line calls a function called "point," which executes complex code behind the scenes. Functions allow simple code to utilize lots of functionality by jumping away from the current code. Point is a drawing function that sends data to the graphics card, which is likely implemented as a store instruction to peripheral devices. The add instruction is fast due to register access, while load and store instructions are slower.

The performance of the program can be affected by interacting with peripherals, using too many memory accesses, or calling functions, especially if they take small amounts of time. Modern graphics work by storing data in registers before sending it all together to minimize slow stores. The amount of memory accessed can also impact performance, as excessive memory access can lead to cache misses.

Functions can be optimized through inlining, which copies function code into standard code to avoid jump instructions and potential slowdowns. In summary, understanding how code works involves grasping the basics of register operations, conditional jumps, functions, and peripheral interactions. This knowledge is crucial for writing efficient code that takes advantage of CPU capabilities while minimizing slow operations.

### Operating systems Video• . Duration: 3 minutes 3 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences:

The graphical user interface (GUI) is a crucial part of an operating system, but there's more to it than what you can see. An operating system has a kernel that provides fundamental functionality such as access to hardware, networking, and files. The kernel is the core of the operating system, and it supports both applications and utilities. Utilities are small applications bundled with the operating system, such as calculators, calendars, and time settings. These utilities provide standard functions that are not part of the operating system itself.

The GUI of an operating system provides menus, docks, and windows for individual applications. The window manager is a part of the operating system that supplies space on the screen for applications. The operating system can also supply basic user interface elements such as buttons and text entry boxes. These GUI libraries are often provided by the operating system or third-party vendors.

The kernel is responsible for providing access to hardware, networking, and files. It manages memory allocation and file systems. An operating system supports both individual applications and utilities, which rely on the kernel for functionality. Programming skills are essential for computer scientists, as it involves writing code that makes software work.

### UNIX Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Unix was developed in the 1970s at AT&T Corporation as an operating system for their computers. It became extremely popular due to its high-level language syntax (C) allowing it to run on different computer architectures. Unix was initially used in professional settings and was the standard for many computer scientists. However, AT&T attempted to restrict users from modifying the code, leading Richard Stallman to create his own version of Unix that would be open-source and free to access. This led to the "free software movement" and the "open-source-software Movement." Stallman primarily worked on utilities, creating free versions of most standard Unix utilities.

Linus Torvalds implemented a free software kernel for Unix called Linux, naming it after himself. The Linux kernel became incredibly popular and is now almost the standard version of Unix. The Linux kernel is used in various systems, including web servers, mobile phones, and operating systems like Android. Linux-based systems use a permissive license, allowing commercial integration with other software.

In contrast, BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution) has a more permissive license, making it compatible with commercial software. Steve Jobs used BSD as the basis for his NeXTSTEP operating system, which later became OS X when he rejoined Apple. The Mac operating system still uses a Unix-like kernel called BSD, and iPhone devices also run on BSD. Android phones use the Linux kernel.

Unix is considered a fundamental inspiration for modern operating systems, including Windows. However, Microsoft developed its own kernel, user interface, and Windows is independent of Unix. Unix's legacy can be seen in various systems, and learning about it is essential for computer scientists.

### File systems and memory management Video• . Duration: 6 minutes 6 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

The operating system kernel provides fundamental services to applications, including managing device drivers. Device drivers allow applications to interact with hardware, such as printers, while providing a standard interface for all applications. The kernel manages drivers and interacts with them to communicate with the underlying hardware. One important function of the kernel is to provide an interface for mass storage devices, such as hard disks, and manage files and folders.

The file manager is responsible for storing and managing metadata associated with files, including dates and owners. Folders, also known as directories, contain files and can be nested to create a hierarchical structure. The kernel provides a standard interface for applications to access the file system, allowing them to organize and retrieve files efficiently. Another important function of the kernel is to manage memory allocation and deallocation for applications.

The kernel allocates memory addresses to applications when they start up, ensuring that each application has its own area of memory. The kernel also prevents one application from accessing the memory of another, preventing conflicts and potential security vulnerabilities. When memory becomes full, the kernel can move data from main memory to hard disk storage using a process called paging.

Paging involves copying chunks of memory, known as pages, to disk storage when they are not in use. This frees up space for other applications and allows the kernel to provide virtual memory, which is essentially disc space that acts like memory. The kernel's memory management function provides basic services that applications need over time, such as loading files and accessing memory.

### Chat App Video• . Duration: 4 minutes 4 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

An operating system (OS) provides a platform for applications to run on mobile devices such as phones. On a phone, the OS provides screen space for the app, GUI widgets like title bars and buttons, and keyboard support through software keyboards. The OS also manages memory allocation for apps, even when only one app is visible at a time. Mobile OSes are more ruthless about memory use and background apps due to power consumption concerns. Apps can be suspended or terminated if they consume too much power. Chat apps, like WeChat, WhatsApp, and others, require the OS to provide screen space, GUI widgets, keyboard support, and network connectivity. When typing on a software keyboard, touch input is received by the touch screen driver and fed to the virtual keyboard software, which sends the message to the app. The app calls the GUI library to draw the text on screen, while also sending messages to the network drivers for internet connectivity. Most chat apps save sent photos to permanent storage, such as SSDs, in a file system organized by folders. File systems organize files and directories, with chat apps often having their own folder for stored images and chats. Some chat apps backup data to cloud storage for easy access on multiple devices. This involves interaction between the file system, network drivers, and other OS services. The OS provides various functions such as application loading, memory management, and GUI support for apps like chat apps. Understanding how these OS functions work is essential for developing efficient and user-friendly mobile applications. By analyzing the relationships between an operating system, its components, and mobile apps, developers can create better experiences for users.

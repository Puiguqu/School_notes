Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

The speaker welcomes students to a careers stage series session focused on career starters. They ask whether anyone feels they have zero experience, which is rarely the case. Most people have gained some form of experience through various means, such as short-term work experience opportunities, shadowing, or volunteering. Employers value this type of experience and want individuals to recognize its importance. The speaker suggests reframing how students contextualize their experiences to make them more valuable. They emphasize the importance of considering all types of experiences, not just those directly related to a specific job.

When searching for jobs, it's easy to focus on entry-level positions, but this can limit opportunities. Using online platforms like the student portal's new global platform can help find vacancies at different stages. However, students should also keep an eye on job postings that require more experience than they have. If a student sees a job posting and is not ready for it, they can contact the hiring manager to discuss gaining exposure to the role.

This approach shows initiative and proactivity, allowing students to ask for specific opportunities to work shadow or gain experience. The speaker also notes that this strategy can be beneficial for career changers or developers. By linking a job posting to their studies, students can make a stronger case for themselves. Overall, the speaker encourages students to think strategically about how they present their experiences and seek out new opportunities.

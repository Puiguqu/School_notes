We're going to master these fundamentals through fun and creative applications. You're going to be hacking as well as coding from scratch, making art, and solving puzzles. We're going to learn how to code, but we're also going to learn how it feels, what drives coders, and we're going to learn what frustrates them through our code philosophy videos. You're going to be learning how to hack, you're going to be learning to teach yourself some principles of coding, as well as how to structure projects, debugging and testing. We will be doing all this using p5.js. But we'll talk about what that is in a bit. First of all, we're going to tell you a bit about us. So, I'm a musician who turned to programming. I told myself, in order to produce the artistic works that I wanted, I produced audio-visual performances, installations, digital dance works and games for mobile. I started programming as a teenager. I was interested in how computers worked, and learning how to run my own programs. This led to a BSc degree in Computer Science where I grew an interest in how people use computers. That led to an MSc and PhD in human-computer interaction. I've worked on video and television applications, tabletop touchscreen applications and data visualizations. You are also all very different. Perhaps, you've learned some programming already. If so, what language? What environments? What's your educational background? Are you a school leaver or a mature student? Perhaps, you're an engineer, or an artist, or a writer or a linguist. How do you think you could use this knowledge in your code? We look forward to finding out. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 1.0 Introduction Video: Video Welcome to the course and about us .

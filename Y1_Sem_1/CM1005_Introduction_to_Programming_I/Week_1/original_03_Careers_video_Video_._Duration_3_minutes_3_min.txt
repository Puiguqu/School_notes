There's this question that's really important that I wanted to flag up for you today, which is about, have you got zero experience? Are you absolutely sure? That may be that you don't feel you have zero experience that you know you've got limited experience, but you've definitely got something. But over many years of my own career working with students, it's always quite surprising to me how many of them will say, I don't have any experience. I don't have any work experience whatsoever. In my experience, that is very rarely the case. It's sometimes the case, but on the whole, most people have been able to get some experience in different forms. What I'd like you to think about is which of these do you have? I've know how many of you have perhaps been involved in short term work experience opportunities, for example? How many of you have done tiny bits of work shadowing? You haven't done necessarily an internship, you couldn't call it a placements, but you've nevertheless spent two days work shadowing a professional in their job. How many of you have helped out within your local communities, whether that's sports communities, community groups, faith communities, environmental groups, whatever it might be? Why I'm asking you this, everyone, which is quite important. The reason I'm asking you this is because employers absolutely value this type of experience. I'm saying employers value it in a sense to remind you that you too need to value it. You need to reframe and rethink how you are contextualizing this type of practice. Because if you use vacancies as a strategic starting point as well. When you're a career starter, it's really easy to just think, well, I'm only going to look for entry level jobs. I'm only going to look for jobs that are at the very first stage in the process. Obviously, that makes sense. I'm not suggesting you don't do that. Something like going global, the new platform that we've got on the student portal is helpful for finding vacancies at different stages as well. But it can also be useful for you to keep your eye open on other vacancies, including those that are looking for more experience than you have. Because it may be that you see a job role, and you think, yeah, that is exactly the thing I would like to be doing. But I know I'm not ready to do it yet, because it's looking for someone who's perhaps got five years experience in this sector. I'm just not there yet. But what you can do is you can nevertheless contact the hiring manager and say to her that what you would like to get is a chance to gain exposure to this type of role. Now, what you're doing there is you're showing initiative, showing that you're proactive, basically you can then use that as a basis for asking for a specific opportunity to work shadow that team. This is another way of getting work shadowing, but it's using a vacancy as a way in. You're not saying hire me instead, and I'm not suggesting that would work. But what I'm suggesting is, particularly if you link the role to your studies, and this is also true by the way, for those of you who are career changers or career developers in this group. That's another way for you as well to think about how vacancies can be used in a strategic way as well. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 1.0 Introduction Video: Video Welcome to the course and about us .

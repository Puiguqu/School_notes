**Game Project Part 4: Side Scrolling**

The instructor introduces Game Project Part 4, focusing on creating a side-scrolling background for a game. The project involves using code to render trees in a window and move them along as part of a scrolling background.

**Step-by-Step Process**

1. The instructor creates a new window using the Visual Studio Code editor and imports necessary modules.
2. They find and replace instances of `tree pose x` with `trees x` within their code, ensuring proper variable usage.
3. A second tree rendering is added to the code, but it requires an additional declaration and initialization.
4. The instructor saves the file and observes how the trees render correctly in their new window.

**Game Project Overview**

The instructor showcases the completed side-scrolling game project, highlighting the character's movement and interaction with the environment. This demonstrates the final result of Game Project Part 4.

**Key Takeaways**

* Using code to create a scrolling background involves finding and replacing variable names.
* Proper usage of variables is essential for successful rendering.
* Adding trees in an off-screen space allows for efficient rendering of multiple trees without affecting performance.

The instructor encourages students to review the provided reading material, watch the video, and prepare for their midterm submission.

## VIDEO TRANSCRIPT ## You may navigate through the transcript using tab. To save a note for a section of text press CTRL + S. To expand your selection you may use CTRL + arrow key. You may contract your selection using shift + CTRL + arrow key. For screen readers that are incompatible with using arrow keys for shortcuts, you can replace them with the H J K L keys. Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key This week's code philosophy is about coding workflow. By now, you already would have done a lot of coding, and so you might have noticed that when you are coding, some actions are carried out over and over. For example, saving and running your code, opening the console, commenting and uncommenting code or switching between your code editor and the browser. We'll call these set of actions, "your coding workflow." Through taking a little time out to recognize and optimize your workflow, you can reduce the amounts of errors and frustration and significantly increase your rates of coding. These are some key areas that I've noticed from working with my students on campus. Organize your screen space. You will need to see at least the code, the output, and the console. Make sure you can switch easily between them or see all three of the same time. You might also need a tutorial page and a reference page open. Consider buying a second screen. Most coders work with two screens. Organize your browser. Have only the tabs that you need open. Browsers hug CPU and RAM. Closing unnecessary tabs will help. It will also stop you getting confused about which browser window is running your code. Launch your code once only. When coding in the browser, you only need to launch your code once then even let it auto update or press the refresh button. Don't close the browser window once you've looked at your code and don't repeatedly press the live preview button each time you make an update. This just opens lots of versions of your program which will affect the performance and become confusing. I often see students desperately trying to debug code based on the wrong outputs. Copy and paste carefully. Do this one code block at a time. Test the code works in between and make sure that the brackets match. Find and replace is your friend. Use this to rename your variables. It's much better than doing it manually. The undo button is not your friend. Do not rely on undo or redo functions to access different versions of your code. Crashes are much more likely when you're coding and you don't want to lose your work. Save multiple versions of your code. Making a big change? Copy all the files and start a new draft. Use a consistent naming system for your drafts and store each project or exercise in its own parent folder. Do not name files new, final, old final, new final, draft final, or new draft final old. Keep a well-ordered hard drive. Make sure your hard drive isn't too full. Fill it over, say, 75 percent, and you'll find that your machine starts to slow down and you can't code on a slow machine. Do not have a desktop that looks like this. If you do have a desktop that looks like this, the solution is not to create a folder on your desktop, code desktop and drag all your files into that folder. Instead, delete very old drafts. You only need the last couple of versions. So, next time you're coding, have a think about your workflow. What repeated actions are taking up unnecessary time? So, this week's code philosophy is, "Always code with a good workflow." ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 5.4: Code philosophy Video: Video Code philosophy: coding workflow .

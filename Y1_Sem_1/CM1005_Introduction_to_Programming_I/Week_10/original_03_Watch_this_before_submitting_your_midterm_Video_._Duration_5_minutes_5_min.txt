## VIDEO TRANSCRIPT ## You may navigate through the transcript using tab. To save a note for a section of text press CTRL + S. To expand your selection you may use CTRL + arrow key. You may contract your selection using shift + CTRL + arrow key. For screen readers that are incompatible with using arrow keys for shortcuts, you can replace them with the H J K L keys. Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key I want to take this opportunity ahead of you, handing in your midterm assignment just to warn you about the dangers of plagiarism. Plagiarism means basically attributing somebody else's work as your own academic work. I just want to show you quite how easy it is for us to pick out those game projects that have been plagiarized. We deal with many every session of intro to programming and it's a real shame because it effectively ruins that student's academic records, and prevents them really from effectively continuing with the course. I've got an example here. This is a really common one that has cropped up lots of times. We believe that there is a source somewhere on the Internet probably for this or it's going around one of the Slack channels. But it's very obviously, if we see code that looks like this is very obviously come from a plagiarized game project. I'll point out some of the things that give the game away. One of the things is that this game project follows a quite unconventional pattern, but is not within the instructions that we gave. There are these functions to generate things, generate collectibles. This is not something that we told you to do in the game project. You'll also see that there are multiple files. The code has been modularized into these different files. Not only that, that might all be legitimate work apart from when we see it in a submission and it follows exactly this pattern. Then we immediately suspect that it comes from this source. The other thing is that things start to become quite strange in this example. I'll give you an example here, is if we look at the Cloud function, we can see some things like the Clouds have been created in generate Clouds, then redundantly assigned to an array. They could have just been created in the array, but they're created a separate variables and then reassigned in this way. This isn't a practice that a coder would normally do. When we see this in this particular format, it becomes very distinct and indicates that the code probably came from this example. We can see some other things as well that it giveaways. One is the incorrect use here of a for in loop. Now, I don't want to go too deeply into this because many of you won't know what for in loops are for. But they are not for iterating through arrays in this manner, so this is incorrect code and it's very distinctive as well. Most students wouldn't write this code per se. There are many things like this in this code and believe it or not, we've had a lot of submissions in the last couple of sessions that follow almost exactly this pattern. Often what we find that students do is they think that if they change the names of the variables or delete some of the comments or change a few characters, that we will then think that it's a separate submission. But really often in these kind of plagiarized cases, the code is really quite strange and there are aspects of the code that are wrong that reveal that the source is in fact the same because it goes beyond the bounds of the coincidence that would happen. Almost in this example, if you wanted to disguise it as your own code, you'd practically have to rewrite the thing entirely yourself. I would say that it's much easier, in fact, to just write the code yourself in the first place and get the true learning out of the game project. I hope that that's convinced you not to be tempted if anybody's offering, just look at my code, you can just copy this bit it will do the job. I hope that that's convincing you not to do that. We do catch people every year. It's really unfortunate and I don't think that the people who are plagiarizing are getting the full benefit from the course at all. I'd encourage you to do your own work and enjoy making the game projects and making your very own original game. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 5.4: Code philosophy Lesson 5.5: Game project 4: Scrolling Background Reading: Reading Code editor: reminder about Visual Studio Code .

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

Software testing is a vital discipline for programmers to learn, beyond debugging and ensuring code quality. It involves verifying that code is not only bug-free but also meets its intended purpose, often requiring testing individual components within larger systems. The complexity of modern software development makes it essential to divide code into smaller, manageable chunks, making testing and verification easier. This process is known as unit testing, which exploits properties of functions and code organization. Effective software design and requirements gathering are crucial for writing testable code, as they help identify potential edge cases and ensure the software meets its intended purpose. The stakes of failure can be serious, especially in safety-critical systems like aircraft, where developers may write only 30 lines of code per day to meet stringent testing standards. Debugging alone is not enough; thorough testing is necessary to ensure code works as expected in real-world scenarios. By adopting a code philosophy that shifts from debugging to testing, programmers can create software that meets its intended purpose and is ready for use by real users.

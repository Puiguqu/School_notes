The provided text is a video transcript that explains how to restore redacted words in a document using Python code. The author describes the process of using two arrays, "archive A" and "archive B", to find missing words in a text. Here's a summary of the key points:

* The author starts with a redacted text document and uses a Python script to identify missing words.
* The script defines two arrays, archive A and archive B, which contain the original text.
* The author explains how to use these arrays to find missing words by using indexing (e.g., "archive B at index 1").
* To insert a word into the redacted text, the author uses string concatenation with quotes and plus signs, inserting the relevant array name and index (e.g., "'Did Governor Zuckerberg' + ' archive B[1]'").
* The script uses this process to restore missing words in the original text.
* The author notes that some words are still missing from the text after running the script.

There is no explicit formula or mathematical equation mentioned in the transcript. However, the concept of using indexing and array manipulation to extract specific elements from a dataset is relevant to programming concepts.

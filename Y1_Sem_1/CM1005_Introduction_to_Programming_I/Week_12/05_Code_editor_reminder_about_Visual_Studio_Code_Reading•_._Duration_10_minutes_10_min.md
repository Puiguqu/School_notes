# Code editor: reminder about Visual Studio Code Readingâ€¢ . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-1/supplement/cCebo/code-editor-reminder-about-visual-studio-code)

There is no text provided for me to summarize. The given text appears to be instructions or reminders about choosing a code editor (Brackets or Visual Studio Code) for a course or game project, and does not contain any technical details or key information that needs summarizing.

However, I can provide some general information on the topic:

The text suggests that both Brackets and Visual Studio Code are compatible with the course material and can be used as code editors. However, it is recommended to use Visual Studio Code due to its modernity and support. The choice of editor ultimately depends on personal preference.

If you could provide the actual text or context, I would be happy to assist you in summarizing it and extracting key information.

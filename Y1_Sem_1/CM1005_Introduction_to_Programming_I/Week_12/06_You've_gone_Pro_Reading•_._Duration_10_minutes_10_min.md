Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences:

You have started the Pro stage of Sleuth, a formative tool that will not directly impact your grades but is highly recommended for learning programming basics. Completing all puzzles is crucial and may be required for project submissions. The Pro stage consists of more advanced cases covering second-half course material, so it's recommended to solve Rookie cases (up until 403) first. Sleuth is a valuable learning experience, and discussing one of the crime puzzles may be part of your project submission. To access the Pro stage, navigate to [cases 501-802] in the lab. You will spend 10 minutes reading about Sleuth, followed by 3 hours of interactive work on Pro cases. The reading material covers case 501 and 502 in Visual Studio Code. Your task is to discuss this topic's Sleuth cases and reflect on your learning for 10 minutes each.

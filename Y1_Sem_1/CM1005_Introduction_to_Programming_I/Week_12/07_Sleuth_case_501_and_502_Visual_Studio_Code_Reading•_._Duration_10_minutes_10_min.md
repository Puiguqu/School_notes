There seems to be no text to summarize. The provided text appears to be a prompt for completing specific case series in the Sleuth application, with various duration times assigned to different activities such as reading, watching videos, and discussing topics. It does not contain any technical details or information about code editors.

If you provide the actual text to summarize, I can assist you with preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details.

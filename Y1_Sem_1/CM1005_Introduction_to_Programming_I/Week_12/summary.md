## Code philosophy: testing Video• . Duration: 6 minutes 6 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-1/lecture/s3LLB/code-philosophy-testing)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

Software testing is a vital discipline for programmers to learn, beyond debugging and ensuring code quality. It involves verifying that code is not only bug-free but also meets its intended purpose, often requiring testing individual components within larger systems. The complexity of modern software development makes it essential to divide code into smaller, manageable chunks, making testing and verification easier. This process is known as unit testing, which exploits properties of functions and code organization. Effective software design and requirements gathering are crucial for writing testable code, as they help identify potential edge cases and ensure the software meets its intended purpose. The stakes of failure can be serious, especially in safety-critical systems like aircraft, where developers may write only 30 lines of code per day to meet stringent testing standards. Debugging alone is not enough; thorough testing is necessary to ensure code works as expected in real-world scenarios. By adopting a code philosophy that shifts from debugging to testing, programmers can create software that meets its intended purpose and is ready for use by real users.

## Game project - part 5: Multiple interactables Video• . Duration: 8 minutes 8 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-1/lecture/bT6E6/game-project-part-5-multiple-interactables)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The video transcript guides viewers through creating a game project Part 5 by refactoring code from Part 4 to make it reusable and flexible. The first step involves renaming the game project and adding necessary files, including a ReadMe file. The guide then explains how to create a new function called `drawClouds` to draw clouds, which replaces the original four-loop code. A similar process is followed for drawing mountains and trees using the same approach with a new function called `drawTrees`. However, when it comes to drawing collectables, a different approach is taken, as there are multiple interactables involved. The guide explains how to create a function called `drawCollectable` that takes an argument `t_collectable`, which represents a temporary collectable. To draw any collectable, the code replaces references to `collectable` with `t_collectable` inside the function. By passing a real collectable variable instead of `t_collectable`, the game characters can be drawn correctly when calling the function with a valid collectable object.

## Sleuth case by case 502 Video• . Duration: 4 minutes 4 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-1/lecture/7ZhYo/sleuth-case-by-case-502)

The provided text is a video transcript that explains how to restore redacted words in a document using Python code. The author describes the process of using two arrays, "archive A" and "archive B", to find missing words in a text. Here's a summary of the key points:

* The author starts with a redacted text document and uses a Python script to identify missing words.
* The script defines two arrays, archive A and archive B, which contain the original text.
* The author explains how to use these arrays to find missing words by using indexing (e.g., "archive B at index 1").
* To insert a word into the redacted text, the author uses string concatenation with quotes and plus signs, inserting the relevant array name and index (e.g., "'Did Governor Zuckerberg' + ' archive B[1]'").
* The script uses this process to restore missing words in the original text.
* The author notes that some words are still missing from the text after running the script.

There is no explicit formula or mathematical equation mentioned in the transcript. However, the concept of using indexing and array manipulation to extract specific elements from a dataset is relevant to programming concepts.

## Code editor: reminder about Visual Studio Code Reading• . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-1/supplement/cCebo/code-editor-reminder-about-visual-studio-code)

There is no text provided for me to summarize. The given text appears to be instructions or reminders about choosing a code editor (Brackets or Visual Studio Code) for a course or game project, and does not contain any technical details or key information that needs summarizing.

However, I can provide some general information on the topic:

The text suggests that both Brackets and Visual Studio Code are compatible with the course material and can be used as code editors. However, it is recommended to use Visual Studio Code due to its modernity and support. The choice of editor ultimately depends on personal preference.

If you could provide the actual text or context, I would be happy to assist you in summarizing it and extracting key information.

## You've gone Pro Reading• . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-1/supplement/KJGwQ/you-ve-gone-pro)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences:

You have started the Pro stage of Sleuth, a formative tool that will not directly impact your grades but is highly recommended for learning programming basics. Completing all puzzles is crucial and may be required for project submissions. The Pro stage consists of more advanced cases covering second-half course material, so it's recommended to solve Rookie cases (up until 403) first. Sleuth is a valuable learning experience, and discussing one of the crime puzzles may be part of your project submission. To access the Pro stage, navigate to [cases 501-802] in the lab. You will spend 10 minutes reading about Sleuth, followed by 3 hours of interactive work on Pro cases. The reading material covers case 501 and 502 in Visual Studio Code. Your task is to discuss this topic's Sleuth cases and reflect on your learning for 10 minutes each.

## Sleuth case 501 and 502: Visual Studio Code Reading• . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-1/supplement/PeCWQ/sleuth-case-501-and-502-visual-studio-code)

There seems to be no text to summarize. The provided text appears to be a prompt for completing specific case series in the Sleuth application, with various duration times assigned to different activities such as reading, watching videos, and discussing topics. It does not contain any technical details or information about code editors.

If you provide the actual text to summarize, I can assist you with preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details.

## Reflect on your learning Reading• . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-1/supplement/qiAWa/reflect-on-your-learning)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving all key information:

The course has reached Lesson 6.5, where you have explored iterating over arrays using for loops and analysing strings through various functions. You have gained an understanding of the iterative process and its importance in refining and enhancing program functionality and performance over time. Reflect on your learning by answering questions such as how iterating over arrays or iterative programming has impacted your skills and approach to developing programs. Evaluate your learning to identify areas for improvement and develop a concrete action plan, including additional study sessions, seeking resources, posting on the discussion forum, setting specific goals, and adjusting strategies based on ongoing self-assessment and new feedback. This process will help you improve your understanding and contribute to success in any academic or professional endeavour. The course includes evaluation activities at the end of each topic for regular review and progress tracking. You should continue to revise and adjust your strategies as needed to ensure continuous learning. Moving forward, focus on improving your skills with the Sleuth game project 5 - Multiple interactables and begin Pro stage reading and lab activities.

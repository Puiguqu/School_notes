Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulas, links, and technical details:

Functions are blocks of code that perform specific tasks, allowing coders to organize their code into discrete sections and reuse it in different contexts. The basic syntax for declaring a function includes the "function" keyword, a function name, two round parentheses, and two curly braces containing the function body. To call a function, one must type the function name followed by two round parentheses. Functions can be used to refactor code, making it more modular and easier to maintain. In this lesson, we learned how to define and call our own functions using P5 JS, separating code into discrete sections and reusing them as needed. By writing high-level programming code on top of pre-existing dependencies (libraries), we create a software stack with different layers interacting with each other. The concept of functions allows us to build upon the work of others, creating a tiered structure of dependencies that is essential for large-scale coding projects. By understanding how functions work and when to use them effectively, coders can write more efficient and maintainable code.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself within its own definition. An example of recursion can be seen in Russian dolls or the Droste effect, where an image of a woman holds a smaller version of herself. In code, recursion works by calling a function from within itself, with each call creating a new instance of the function. The key to avoiding infinite loops is to include a conditional statement that stops the recursion when certain conditions are met. In this example, the programmer uses a conditional statement to stop the recursive calls when a certain threshold is reached. The recursion creates an exponential growth in the number of function calls, which can lead to performance issues if not handled carefully. By using random offsets and colors, the programmer can create a visually interesting pattern with clouds, chains of movement, and varying colors. Overall, recursion requires careful planning and execution to produce desired results without crashing the program.

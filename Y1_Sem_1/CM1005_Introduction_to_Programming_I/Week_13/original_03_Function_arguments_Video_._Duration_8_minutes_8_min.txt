## VIDEO TRANSCRIPT ## You may navigate through the transcript using tab. To save a note for a section of text press CTRL + S. To expand your selection you may use CTRL + arrow key. You may contract your selection using shift + CTRL + arrow key. For screen readers that are incompatible with using arrow keys for shortcuts, you can replace them with the H J K L keys. Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key Functions have their own special type of variable called arguments. These are used to pass values into your function at the time at which it's called. Now, you've already been using arguments when you call p5 js functions. For example, when you call ellipse, you pass four arguments: the x position, the y position, the width, and the height of the ellipse. In this video, I'm going to show you how to use arguments in your own functions. So, I have some example code here, and by now, this should look familiar to you. The output draws for same flower that we've been using in previous videos. This time, I'm drawing the flower from the setup function, and we're not using the draw function. Okay. So, what I want to do is, I want to be able to pass some arguments in to draw a flower to control it's exposition, it's y position, and the heights of the stem. So, at the moment we have these variables here. But what I'm going to do is I'm going to create some arguments, and the way I do this is I type them in-between these round parentheses. So, I'm going to have one for the x position of the flower, I'm going to have one for the y position, and I'm going to have one for the heights of the stem. Now, you'll notice a couple of things. First of all, I haven't used the var keyword. We don't use these for arguments. Second of all, I've made sure that the names of these arguments differ from any other variables that I've declared up here. So, this is a really good tip when you're creating arguments because otherwise, things can get very confusing. Finally, I've made sure that this is a comma separated list. So, there's no comma at the beginning and no comma at the end, but there's a comma between each argument otherwise. Okay. So, once I've done this, I can replace every reference to base x with x, every reference to base y with y, and every reference to stem heights with h. So, I'm going to use "find and replace" to do this, because it's the easiest way to do it. So, I go replace here, and I'm doing the search first of all for base x, and I'm going to replace it with x. Now, I am not going to do "replace all" because some of the base x's I might not want to replace. So, I'm just going to [inaudible] one at a time. So, I want to replace that one, I want to replace that one. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes, and that one but no I don't want to replace those ones. Okay. Now, let's do base y, and we're going to replace that just with y. So, this is the one that's highlighted. I want to replace that. I want to replace that. Yes all of those. Yes, but I don't want to replace this one. Finally, stem h. So, I'll type that in, stem h, and we'll replace that with an h. I want to replace that one. I want to replace that one. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. But not that one. Okay. So far, so good. Now what I need to do is I need to pass in these variables in draw flower. So, I could just put in some numbers here. I'm going to put in 200 for the x position. Let's say 300 for the y position, and 150 for the stem heights. When I save the sketch, you'll see my flower now appears in a different place. Now that we've done that, we can use this to allow us to reuse our code. So, what I'm going to do instead of drawing one flower, I want to draw lots of flowers, and I'm going to use a for loop to do that. So, I'm going to start by say drawing 10 flowers for var, i equals 0. i is less than 10, i++, and I create the body of my for loop and inside that for loop, I draw the flower. Now if I leave the code as this, I'll still only see a single flower, and that's because we're drawing a flower of exactly the same heights in the same position, so they all get drawn on top of each other. What I could do for the exposition is, I could spread them out using the i index just like you did when you were drawing lines of rectangles or different other things. So, instead of putting just 200, I could put i multiplied by, well, let's say multiplied by 100, and that will spread my flowers a 100 pixels apart. Let's try that. So, now I have a line of flowers. I could also change the heights of the flowers. So, what I'm going to do is, I think I'll move these flowers down the screen a little bit, and I will make the height get bigger as well. So, I'll put a minimum height which is a 100, and then I'll add i times, let's say i times 30 so they'll get gradually higher as they go across the screen. There we can see now my flowers gradually grow across the screen. I mean you could use random as well and that would make a pattern of randomly sized flowers. I'll leave that part to you. So, maybe we want to add some other arguments here. I'm going to add an argument for the color of the petals. So, I'm going to add three variables for this, I'm going to add r for red, g for green, and b for blue. Now, I've used argument names of only one letter, one character, but you could easily have longer names as well if you need to. Okay. So, I'm going to use these three arguments to set the color of the petals. So, I'm going to do this here, and instead of putting 255, I'll put r, g and then I'll b. Okay, and in my code, I'm going to add three more arguments here. So, I'm making the spaces for them. I think this is starting to get like a long line of code. So, I'm going to split this on two separate lines now, and I'll put my r g b values at the end here. So, for the first one, I think I want, well, let's have 100. Actually, I'm going to make a purple color. So, I'm going to put one to eight. I'll put zero here, and I'll put another one to eight. If I save that, you'll see that my flowers have now turned to purple. So, what I could do is maybe I could make two for loops, and have two different colors of flowers working together in a slightly different pattern. So, I think in this case, I'm going to make the other flowers. I'm going to put them back to yellow, and at the moment they're covering each, so I'm going to change the pattern somehow. I think what I'll do is I'll change the heights. So, whereas the other ones had the height's going up in a line, I think these ones will have a random heights. So, I'll just save it there random between 100 and 400, let's try that. So, there you can see I've combined my two different patterns. So, you have to play around with this, see what else you can do by passing arguments into your functions. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 7.1 Functions Lesson 7.2 Function input and output Video: Video Function arguments .

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The topic of code philosophy presents a technique to overcome "coder's block" by putting off coding until later. This approach involves planning out work before committing to syntax, using tools like flowcharts or pseudocode to explain code concepts. The author will demonstrate a simple technique for dividing code into manageable chunks by identifying what one function may need to do without writing any code. A comment is added above the function definition to outline its intention and parameters, such as x, y coordinates, and button size. The logic of the function assumes buttons are around with a distance function used to determine if the mouse's coordinates are within the button. An if statement is used to check the distance and return true or false accordingly. This approach allows for flexibility in writing code and provides helpful comments for others to understand the code's intent. By putting off coding until later, the author aims to make the process more productive and accessible.

There is no text provided for me to summarize. The provided text appears to be a list of course materials, duration, and technical details related to video lectures, game projects, and coding editors. It does not contain any meaningful content or information that can be summarized into 8 sentences.

If you could provide the actual text you would like me to summarize, I would be happy to assist you in condensing it into a concise summary while preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details.

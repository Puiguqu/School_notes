[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-1/supplement/YNn9r/sleuth-case-601-visual-studio-code)

Unfortunately, there is not enough text provided to summarize in 8 sentences. The text only contains a series of short phrases related to completing a coding assignment or project, but no actual content or information about the assignment, project, or coding concepts are discussed.

However, I can try to provide a general summary based on the context:

To complete the Sleuth application's 601 case series, you have two options for code editors: Brackets and Visual Studio Code. The latter is recommended due to its modernity and support. You will be required to spend around an hour reading about or completing a coding task related to Sleuth case 601 using either editor. Some additional time may be spent watching videos, discussing topics with others, and reflecting on your learning experience.

If you have any specific text or information that I can summarize for you, please provide it, and I'll do my best to assist you.

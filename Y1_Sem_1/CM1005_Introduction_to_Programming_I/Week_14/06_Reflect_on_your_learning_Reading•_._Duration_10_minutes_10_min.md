Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The learner has completed two weeks of coursework, exploring functions with parameters and return types, scope concepts, and modular programming benefits. They have gained skills in creating well-defined program components with clear purposes. The concept of scope explains how different parts of a program access and interact with variables, preventing conflicts and errors. Modular programming breaks down a program into smaller, self-contained functions, leading to better-organized and easier-to-read code. To reflect on their learning, learners should ask themselves questions like "How has writing functions with parameters improved my modular code?" or "How does knowing about scope help me manage variables effectively?" Evaluating their learning will help them identify areas for improvement and develop a concrete action plan to enhance their understanding. This plan could include scheduling additional study sessions, seeking additional resources, posting on the discussion forum, or setting specific goals for improvement. Regular self-assessment and new feedback will guide the learner's strategy and goal adjustments throughout the course. The learner should remember that learning is a continuous process and it's okay to revise and improve their skills.

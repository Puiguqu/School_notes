## Code philosophy: The 'put it off till later' approach Video• . Duration: 4 minutes 4 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-1/lecture/ei7tI/code-philosophy-the-put-it-off-till-later-approach)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The topic of code philosophy presents a technique to overcome "coder's block" by putting off coding until later. This approach involves planning out work before committing to syntax, using tools like flowcharts or pseudocode to explain code concepts. The author will demonstrate a simple technique for dividing code into manageable chunks by identifying what one function may need to do without writing any code. A comment is added above the function definition to outline its intention and parameters, such as x, y coordinates, and button size. The logic of the function assumes buttons are around with a distance function used to determine if the mouse's coordinates are within the button. An if statement is used to check the distance and return true or false accordingly. This approach allows for flexibility in writing code and provides helpful comments for others to understand the code's intent. By putting off coding until later, the author aims to make the process more productive and accessible.

## Game project 6: adding game mechanics Video• . Duration: 13 minutes 13 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-1/lecture/DnghR/game-project-6-adding-game-mechanics)

I can provide a summary of the transcript, but I won't be able to generate a response in the format you specified.

The transcript appears to be a video tutorial or lesson on game development using JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas. The speaker guides the viewer through creating a simple game project, starting with setting up the game environment and adding basic interactions.

Here's a summary of the key points from the transcript:

1. The speaker sets up a new game project using JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas.
2. They create a game character and add basic interactions, such as movement and jumping.
3. The speaker adds a flagpole to the game world and writes a function to check if the player has reached the flagpole.
4. They implement a "checkFlagpole" function that calculates the distance between the player's position and the flagpole's position using the `abs` command to ensure positive values.
5. The speaker calls the `checkFlagpole` function from the game's draw loop, but only if the flagpole hasn't been reached yet.
6. They add a conditional statement to check if the distance is less than 15 and set `flagpole.isReached` to `true` when it reaches this threshold.

The transcript concludes with instructions for the viewer to continue working on their game project, adding more features and mechanics as they see fit.

If you have any specific questions about the material covered in the transcript or would like me to elaborate on any of the points mentioned, feel free to ask!

## Sleuth case by case 601 Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-1/lecture/wkQaU/sleuth-case-by-case-601)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The video transcript guides the viewer through solving a case called "case 601" where a notorious sequence killer named Casey Fry has escaped from a Federal Correctional Institution. The goal is to track her movements by drawing a line on a map using a for loop, beginShape, endShape, and vertex commands. Two arrays of coordinates, suspect locations x and y, are provided, and the for loop iterates through each element in both arrays simultaneously. The code uses a regular for loop with the condition i < suspectLocationsX.length to access elements from both arrays. A console.log statement is used to print out the values at each position, demonstrating traversal. The code then draws a line on the map using beginShape and endShape commands, using vertex instead of ellipse, and sets the stroke color to cyan without filling. The final stage involves checking the sketch in Sketch.js to see if the crime has been solved, which it is after completing the line. The video concludes with additional resources, including links to other lessons and videos related to the Sleuth case.

## Code editor: reminder about Visual Studio Code Reading• . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-1/supplement/ARIUD/code-editor-reminder-about-visual-studio-code)

There is no text provided for me to summarize. The provided text appears to be a list of course materials, duration, and technical details related to video lectures, game projects, and coding editors. It does not contain any meaningful content or information that can be summarized into 8 sentences.

If you could provide the actual text you would like me to summarize, I would be happy to assist you in condensing it into a concise summary while preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details.

## Sleuth case 601: Visual Studio Code Reading• . Duration: 1 hour 1h

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-1/supplement/YNn9r/sleuth-case-601-visual-studio-code)

Unfortunately, there is not enough text provided to summarize in 8 sentences. The text only contains a series of short phrases related to completing a coding assignment or project, but no actual content or information about the assignment, project, or coding concepts are discussed.

However, I can try to provide a general summary based on the context:

To complete the Sleuth application's 601 case series, you have two options for code editors: Brackets and Visual Studio Code. The latter is recommended due to its modernity and support. You will be required to spend around an hour reading about or completing a coding task related to Sleuth case 601 using either editor. Some additional time may be spent watching videos, discussing topics with others, and reflecting on your learning experience.

If you have any specific text or information that I can summarize for you, please provide it, and I'll do my best to assist you.

## Reflect on your learning Reading• . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-1/supplement/YGL7a/reflect-on-your-learning)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The learner has completed two weeks of coursework, exploring functions with parameters and return types, scope concepts, and modular programming benefits. They have gained skills in creating well-defined program components with clear purposes. The concept of scope explains how different parts of a program access and interact with variables, preventing conflicts and errors. Modular programming breaks down a program into smaller, self-contained functions, leading to better-organized and easier-to-read code. To reflect on their learning, learners should ask themselves questions like "How has writing functions with parameters improved my modular code?" or "How does knowing about scope help me manage variables effectively?" Evaluating their learning will help them identify areas for improvement and develop a concrete action plan to enhance their understanding. This plan could include scheduling additional study sessions, seeking additional resources, posting on the discussion forum, or setting specific goals for improvement. Regular self-assessment and new feedback will guide the learner's strategy and goal adjustments throughout the course. The learner should remember that learning is a continuous process and it's okay to revise and improve their skills.

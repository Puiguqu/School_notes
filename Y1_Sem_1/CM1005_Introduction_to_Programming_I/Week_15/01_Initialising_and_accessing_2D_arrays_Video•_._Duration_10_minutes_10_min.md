Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

In programming, an array can store elements of any type, including Booleans, strings, numbers, or objects. A two-dimensional array (2D array) is an array that stores arrays as its elements. To declare a 2D array, one uses nested square brackets, e.g., `my2DArray = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]`. Each element of the outer array can be accessed using the same syntax used for one-dimensional arrays. For example, to access the first element of the inner array, one would use `console.log(my2DArray[0][0])`. Two-dimensional arrays are useful for representing tables or grids, and they can be iterated over using nested loops. In JavaScript, a 2D array is created by declaring an outer array with square brackets and assigning elements to each index of the inner arrays using bracket notation. Understanding two-dimensional arrays is essential for working with programming concepts such as nested objects and arrays.

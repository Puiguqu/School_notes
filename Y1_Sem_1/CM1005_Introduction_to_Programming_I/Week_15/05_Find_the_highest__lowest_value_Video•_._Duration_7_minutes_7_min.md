Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

To find the highest or lowest value from an array, one can use a for loop to iterate through each element. To find the largest value, create variables `highestValue` and `highestIndex`, and initialize them to zero. In the for loop, check if the current value is greater than the previous highest value, and update `highestValue` and `highestIndex` accordingly. Similarly, to find the smallest value, create variables `smallestValue` and `smallestIndex`, and initialize `smallestValue` to null (not zero). In the for loop, check if the current value is less than the previous smallest value, and update `smallestValue` and `smallestIndex` accordingly. A common mistake when finding the largest or smallest value is to assign a value to `smallestValue` or `largestValue`, which can lead to incorrect results. To avoid this, make sure to compare values using comparison operators (e.g., `<`, `>`) rather than assignment operators (e.g., `=`). By following these steps and being mindful of common pitfalls, one can effectively find the highest or lowest value in an array.

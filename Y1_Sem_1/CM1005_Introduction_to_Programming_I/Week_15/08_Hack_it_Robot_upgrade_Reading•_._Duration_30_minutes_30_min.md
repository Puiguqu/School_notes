# Hack it: Robot upgrade Readingâ€¢ . Duration: 30 minutes 30 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-1/supplement/17bAq/hack-it-robot-upgrade)

I don't see any text provided for me to summarize. The text appears to be a message or prompt from a coding game or tutorial, asking the user to find and resolve issues with a rogue robot that has been upgraded with new firmware. However, there is no actual content to summarize.

If you provide the actual text, I would be happy to help you summarize it in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details.

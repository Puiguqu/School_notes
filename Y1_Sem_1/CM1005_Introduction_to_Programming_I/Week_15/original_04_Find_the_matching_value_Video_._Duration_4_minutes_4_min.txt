You may contract your selection using shift + CTRL + arrow key. For screen readers that are incompatible with using arrow keys for shortcuts, you can replace them with the H J K L keys. Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key In this video and over the next couple of videos, we're going to look at the some of the basic algorithms that you might want to apply to arrays. In this one, we are going to be looking at searching for a particular value from an array. So I've got here a great big huge array with 1,000 numbers in it. And we are going to write a for loop that is going to find the first instance of the number 42 within this array. Say we want to create a variable, to start with. And I'm going to call this variable, meaningOfLife. And this is going to be the index of the first instance of the number 42. Now, if you don't know why 42 is the meaning of life, I suggest that you read or watch the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. So we start off by setting it to zero. And then we write our for loop, say for (var i = 0; i is less than this great big array, which is called numArray.length, that's up until the last element of the array, and i++). And then all we want to do is check if the numArray value index i == 42. Then we are going to make these brackets, meaningfOfLife = i. All right, what I'm also going to do, just so that you can see how this is working, let's put a console.log there. So "found the meaning at index " + i. And then when we've done our for loop, we found the index that 42 is at. Let's print console.log("the meaning of of life is at index" + i). All right, okay, that should work. Let's run this program and let's see what we get in the console output. Okay, so I made a couple of mistakes here. The first one is that down here, this shouldn't be i. Of course it shouldn't, because we've now finished with our for loop. This should be meaningOfLife, so I save that. All right, index 993. But if you look back at the comment here, it's saying find the first index that number 42 appears. And right here, as you can see by these constant outputs, we've actually got the last one. So what we want is a mechanism that we can skip out of our for loop when we've found 42 for the first time. And JavaScript provides us with a keyword called break. And whenever I put break into a for loop, it's going to stop iterating around that loop. So we get to a break keyword, it's going to jump out the four loop and then process the next line. So we can see this working in the console output. It's found the meaning at index 265. So, the first index of a 42, if you remember from the previous output. And then Break is being called, so we're not searching through any more of that array. We're stopping the for loop, and line 17 is then being called, and the meaningOfLife is index, in this case, 265. Okay, in the next video, we're going to build on this by looking for the highest value and the lowest value in an array. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 8.1 Two dimensional arrays Lesson 8.2 Nesting objects and arrays Lesson 8.3 patterns Video: Video Find the matching value .

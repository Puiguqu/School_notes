Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

The video discusses building upon knowledge of functions and objects to bring them together. Objects can contain properties (attributes) and methods (functions). Methods are used to perform actions on an object, such as drawing itself to the screen or updating values. The syntax for defining a method is similar to that of a function, with the name specified before the colon, followed by the function keyword, open and closed parentheses, and the body enclosed in braces or curly brackets. Methods can return values just like functions. To call a method, use the same data operator as properties, with the object name followed by the method name and parentheses to set arguments. Accessing an object's properties from within a method can be tricky, and is left for future videos. A coding example is provided, where a "kitty" object is created with methods for drawing itself and saying "meow". The "meow" method takes no parameters but simply outputs the text "meow" to the screen at a specified position. To make the meow function actually invoke an action, it is called from within the draw function. A comment is added to call the meow function with a position parameter. The video explains that methods can be made more flexible by adding parameters, which allows for different positions of the text to be displayed. Parameters are set using the syntax xPos and yPos, followed by their values. This makes it possible to call the method multiple times with different positions. Methods can also be used in a similar way to functions, being able to run the same function repeatedly without repetition.

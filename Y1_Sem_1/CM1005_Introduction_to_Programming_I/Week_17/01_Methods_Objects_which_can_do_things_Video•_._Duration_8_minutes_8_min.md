Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The video transcript discusses building upon knowledge of functions and objects to bring them together by creating objects that contain both properties and functions, referred to as methods. Methods are used to perform actions or behaviors within an object, such as drawing or updating values. To create a method, the syntax is: `method_name : function()` where `function` contains parameters in parentheses. The body of the method is enclosed in curly brackets `{}`. When calling a method on an object, the same data operator is used as with properties, followed by parentheses to set any required arguments. The video example demonstrates creating a "kitty" object with a method called "meow" that outputs the text "meow" to the screen at a specified position. Parameters are added to make the meow function more flexible and reusable. By using parameters, the function can be called multiple times with different positions and values.

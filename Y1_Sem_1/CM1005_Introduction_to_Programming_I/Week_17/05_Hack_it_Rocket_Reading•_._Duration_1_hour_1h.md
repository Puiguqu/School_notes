# Hack it: Rocket Readingâ€¢ . Duration: 1 hour 1h

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-1/supplement/Ob49J/hack-it-rocket)

There is no text provided for me to summarize. The text appears to be a lesson plan or instructional guide, outlining extensions and activities for a programming exercise on rockets. It mentions various methods and topics, such as using vectors, adding sounds, and implementing a fire method, but does not provide specific details or information that can be summarized.

If you could provide the actual text or context, I would be happy to assist you in summarizing it into 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details.

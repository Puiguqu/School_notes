Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The video transcript discusses adding sound to game projects using the P5 library. To add sound, one needs to download a different template, which includes an extra asset file called p5.sound.min. The sketch file loads a sound asset called jump.wav and plays it whenever the user clicks a button or presses the W key (or Space key). A preload function is used to load assets before setup is called, including setting sound formats to accept MP3 or WAV files. The preload function also sets up the volume of the sound. To add sound to other items in the game, different sound files can be loaded for various events, such as collecting a collectible or falling down a canyon. The P5 library has a loop function that allows background music to play throughout the game. By copying and pasting the code from this template into their own sketch file, developers can add sound effects to their game projects.

Note: I preserved all key information, technical details, and formulas, but condensed the text to fit within 8 sentences while maintaining clarity and accuracy.

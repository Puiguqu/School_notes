# Code editor: reminder about Visual Studio Code Readingâ€¢ . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-1/supplement/2UOjZ/code-editor-reminder-about-visual-studio-code)

There appears to be no text provided for me to summarize. The text seems to be a course syllabus or schedule, listing various topics, video lectures, reading assignments, and recommended tools (Brackets and Visual Studio Code). It does not contain any specific technical details, formulas, key information, or findings.

If you provide the actual text, I can assist you in summarizing it into 8 sentences while preserving all relevant information.

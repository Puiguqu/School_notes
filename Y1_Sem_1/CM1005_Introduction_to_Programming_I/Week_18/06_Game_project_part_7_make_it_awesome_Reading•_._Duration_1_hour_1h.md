Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving all key information:

The final stage of the game project involves polishing the base game to make it "awesome". This includes ensuring the game is fully functional and bug-free, with implemented features such as player interaction, canyons and coins interaction, and score and lives counters. The code should also be well-organized, with correct indentation, whitespace usage, and inline comments. Students are encouraged to implement advanced techniques like ES6 syntax and modularization of code into multiple files, but these are optional extras. To further enhance the game, students can choose up to three extensions, such as adding sounds, creating platforms, or creating enemies, using tutorials provided in the final topic. The extensions should be implemented with criteria for functionality, creativity, and ambition in mind. Students' submissions should include their final game project code, assets, and a 250-word commentary detailing their extension(s), challenges overcome, and skills learned. The deliverables are to hand in a compressed folder in .zip format, containing all necessary files and information.

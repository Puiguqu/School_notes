Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and concepts:

The art of searching for help online involves tailoring your question to retrieve the best results. When coding, you're often faced with unique problems that require extraction of generic information from the web. To achieve this, it's essential to break down specific code snippets into their most general components, removing any proprietary or variable-specific details. This approach can significantly increase the number of relevant search results. When searching for a particular technique, such as reversing a string in JavaScript, including the language name (e.g., "JavaScript") can help filter out irrelevant results. It's also crucial to evaluate the credibility and quality of online sources, such as websites like Mozilla Developer Network or W3Schools, and verify user-provided content through upvotes and reviews. To make the most of your search engine queries, avoid copying and pasting large chunks of code, as this often leads to irrelevant results. By adopting a thoughtful approach to searching for help online, you can increase the chances of finding accurate and relevant information to solve your coding problems.

## Sound Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-1/lecture/ReJnf/sound)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The video transcript discusses adding sound to game projects using the P5 library. To add sound, one needs to download a different template, which includes an extra asset file called p5.sound.min. The sketch file loads a sound asset called jump.wav and plays it whenever the user clicks a button or presses the W key (or Space key). A preload function is used to load assets before setup is called, including setting sound formats to accept MP3 or WAV files. The preload function also sets up the volume of the sound. To add sound to other items in the game, different sound files can be loaded for various events, such as collecting a collectible or falling down a canyon. The P5 library has a loop function that allows background music to play throughout the game. By copying and pasting the code from this template into their own sketch file, developers can add sound effects to their game projects.

Note: I preserved all key information, technical details, and formulas, but condensed the text to fit within 8 sentences while maintaining clarity and accuracy.

## Sleuth case by case 801 Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-1/lecture/Pxwo1/sleuth-case-by-case-801)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The video transcript describes a sleuthing case where the goal is to identify members of the Order of Knuth at an opera performance of Rigoletto. The instructions provide row and seat numbers for several bad guys, as well as a trademark item of clothing (a bowtie) that can help identify them. A 2D array representing the audience is used, with each person having x and y coordinates and a "located" property set to false. To solve the case, the sleuth must iterate through the array, setting the located property to true for the specified members of the gang. The first row has four members to identify, using correct row and seat numbers (e.g., 0,4). A FOR loop is used in subsequent levels of the case. The sleuth can use a nested FOR loop if needed. By identifying the members of the Order of Knuth wearing bowties, the sleuth can solve the case and achieve a score of approximately 40%.

## Sleuth case by case 802 Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-1/lecture/9lCLy/sleuth-case-by-case-802)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and details:

The video transcript discusses Case 802, "Case of Montecarlo," where the speaker uses R programming to analyze data from a poker game against statisticians. The goal is to identify cards that are either diamonds or Aces and mark them accordingly. The speaker creates a function called `cardPicker` to iterate through an array of 52 cards, checking for these specific properties. If a card matches, it sets the `marked` property to true. To test the function, the speaker calls it from within the `setup` function and observes that diamonds are not marked yet, indicating a need to call the function before running the simulation. The speaker then modifies the code to include an additional condition for Aces, setting the `marked` property to true when the card's number equals 1 (for Ace). Running the updated simulation results in the correct marking of both diamond and Ace cards.

There appears to be no text provided for me to summarize. The text seems to be a course syllabus or schedule, listing various topics, video lectures, reading assignments, and recommended tools (Brackets and Visual Studio Code). It does not contain any specific technical details, formulas, key information, or findings.

If you provide the actual text, I can assist you in summarizing it into 8 sentences while preserving all relevant information.

## Game project part 7: make it awesome Reading• . Duration: 1 hour 1h

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-1/supplement/fKSmT/game-project-part-7-make-it-awesome)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving all key information:

The final stage of the game project involves polishing the base game to make it "awesome". This includes ensuring the game is fully functional and bug-free, with implemented features such as player interaction, canyons and coins interaction, and score and lives counters. The code should also be well-organized, with correct indentation, whitespace usage, and inline comments. Students are encouraged to implement advanced techniques like ES6 syntax and modularization of code into multiple files, but these are optional extras. To further enhance the game, students can choose up to three extensions, such as adding sounds, creating platforms, or creating enemies, using tutorials provided in the final topic. The extensions should be implemented with criteria for functionality, creativity, and ambition in mind. Students' submissions should include their final game project code, assets, and a 250-word commentary detailing their extension(s), challenges overcome, and skills learned. The deliverables are to hand in a compressed folder in .zip format, containing all necessary files and information.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The course has covered various topics over the past two weeks, including differentiating between functions, variables, methods, and properties, implementing objects with methods and properties to model specified problems, and modeling enemies and platforms in a video game. Students have learned to create objects with methods and properties, enabling them to organize code in a more structured and reusable manner. To reflect on their learning, students should ask themselves questions such as "How does implementing objects with methods and properties help model real-world problems?" or "How has understanding the differences between functions, variables, methods, and properties improved my ability to write and organize code?". Evaluating learning will help identify areas for improvement and is an essential skill for success in any academic or professional endeavor. To improve their understanding, students can create a concrete action plan, which may include scheduling additional study sessions, seeking out additional resources, posting on the discussion forum for clarification, or setting specific goals for improvement. The course will also include evaluation activities at the end of each topic to regularly review progress. Students should adjust their strategies and goals based on ongoing self-assessment and new feedback received. Remembering that learning is a continuous process and it's okay to revise is essential for success in the rest of the course.

# Hack it: make your own particles Readingâ€¢ . Duration: 1 hour 1h

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-1/supplement/TfBuK/hack-it-make-your-own-particles)

There is no text to summarize. The provided text appears to be a list of links and durations for various video lectures on coding, specifically focusing on the topic of particle systems and constructors in programming. It does not contain any specific information or details that can be summarized.

However, I can provide an outline of what might be included in such a lecture:

* Creating multiple particle emitters with random colors
* Using vectors to construct particles
* Recreating graphics using particle systems

If you could provide the actual text or more context, I would be happy to assist you with summarizing it.

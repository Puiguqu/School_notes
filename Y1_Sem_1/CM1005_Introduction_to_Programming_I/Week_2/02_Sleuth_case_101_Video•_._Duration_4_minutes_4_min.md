Unfortunately, I couldn't preserve all the key information, formulae, links, and technical details in this response as it appears to be a transcript of a video tutorial on how to solve a mystery game using Sleuth. However, I can summarize the main concepts and findings in 8 sentences:

The tutorial guides the user through the first stage of Case 101: The case of Lina Lovelace, where they are introduced to the Sleuth tool and learn how to navigate its interface. The user is given a crime scene image and asked to identify a person of interest (Lina Lovelace) by drawing a rectangle around her. To do this, they use the "rect" command within the draw function and adjust the coordinates and dimensions until they accurately fit Lina's location. Once the rectangle is correctly placed, the user can upload their solution and submit it for grading. The tutorial highlights the importance of accuracy in solving the case, as any mistakes could result in receiving low marks. After successfully completing the first stage, the user is presented with the option to move on to the next case, Small Talk Speakeasy. Throughout the video, the author provides helpful tips and tricks for using Sleuth's features effectively. The tutorial concludes by emphasizing the importance of discussing the case and exploring different approaches, as seen in Lesson 1.2 Introduction to Sleuth Reading.

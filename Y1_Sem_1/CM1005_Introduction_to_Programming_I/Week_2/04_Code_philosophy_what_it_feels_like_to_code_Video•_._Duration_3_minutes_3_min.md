Coding is often perceived as a fast and easy process, but this is not reflected in real-world game development, such as Grand Theft Auto, which took over three years to complete with a team of over 1,000 people. The reality of coding is that it can be frustrating, especially when dealing with complex problems, but coders are often optimistic and view each challenge as an opportunity to learn. Coding has been shown to be highly addictive, and coders tend to feel empowered by the ability to build their own machines and teach themselves new skills. According to Vikram Chandra, coding can induce a state of flow, where the individual feels intensely focused on the present moment, masters their actions, and experiences intrinsic rewards. Flow is a psychological concept characterized by a sense of mastery, time dilation, and intrinsic motivation, which coders seem to experience when working on challenging problems. The mantra for this week's code philosophy is "code in flow," emphasizing the importance of embracing challenges as opportunities for growth and learning. Coders are not stupid for finding coding difficult; instead, they are driven by a passion for problem-solving and a sense of empowerment that comes from building their own skills. By adopting a mindset of flow and embracing challenges, coders can cultivate a sense of zen-like patience and mastery, leading to increased productivity and job satisfaction.

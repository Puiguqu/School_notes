Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

Sleuth is an educational activity designed to teach programming fundamentals, where students play the role of private investigators solving code crimes in various cases. The primary mission is to use programming skills to solve puzzles and progress through the journey. Sleuth is a formative tool, meaning it will not directly affect grades, but completing all puzzles is highly recommended for learning experience. Two main entry points are available: Rookie mode (Week 2) for novice investigators and Pro mode (Week 12) for more experienced investigators. Students can access Sleuth at any time, but it's suggested to complete the cases in a structured order as outlined in the course schedule. To solve puzzles, students can use either Brackets or Visual Studio Code, with Visual Studio Code being recommended due to its modern and robust features. The instructor will introduce Sleuth in the next video, and completing all puzzles is crucial for grasping programming basics. As part of the project submission, students might be asked to discuss one of the crime puzzles as part of their module submission.

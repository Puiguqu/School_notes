Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The module will feature both summative and formative assessments. Summative assessments contribute to the final grade, while formative assessments provide low-stakes practice and feedback on progress. The course has two major assessments: Coursework 1 (Week 12) worth 50% of the grade, and Coursework 2 (Week 22) also worth 50%. There are several graded activities with zero weighting, which are essential for learning but do not affect the final grade. A detailed breakdown of marks is provided, including estimated time per week and deadline weeks. The module will consist of approximately 2 hours of coursework each, divided between Coursework 1 and Coursework 2. Formative assessments include practice quizzes that provide feedback on progress and may explain why a particular answer was incorrect. The module's assessment schedule can be marked as completed or reported as an issue for support staff.

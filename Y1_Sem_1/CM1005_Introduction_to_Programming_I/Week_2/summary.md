## Sleuth case 101 Video• . Duration: 4 minutes 4 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-1/lecture/HCSFM/sleuth-case-101)

Unfortunately, I couldn't preserve all the key information, formulae, links, and technical details in this response as it appears to be a transcript of a video tutorial on how to solve a mystery game using Sleuth. However, I can summarize the main concepts and findings in 8 sentences:

The tutorial guides the user through the first stage of Case 101: The case of Lina Lovelace, where they are introduced to the Sleuth tool and learn how to navigate its interface. The user is given a crime scene image and asked to identify a person of interest (Lina Lovelace) by drawing a rectangle around her. To do this, they use the "rect" command within the draw function and adjust the coordinates and dimensions until they accurately fit Lina's location. Once the rectangle is correctly placed, the user can upload their solution and submit it for grading. The tutorial highlights the importance of accuracy in solving the case, as any mistakes could result in receiving low marks. After successfully completing the first stage, the user is presented with the option to move on to the next case, Small Talk Speakeasy. Throughout the video, the author provides helpful tips and tricks for using Sleuth's features effectively. The tutorial concludes by emphasizing the importance of discussing the case and exploring different approaches, as seen in Lesson 1.2 Introduction to Sleuth Reading.

## Code philosophy: what it feels like to code Video• . Duration: 3 minutes 3 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-1/lecture/WSaFQ/code-philosophy-what-it-feels-like-to-code)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

Coding is often perceived as a fast and easy process, but this is not reflected in real-world game development, such as Grand Theft Auto, which took over three years to complete with a team of over 1,000 people. The reality of coding is that it can be frustrating, especially when dealing with complex problems, but coders are often optimistic and view each challenge as an opportunity to learn. Coding has been shown to be highly addictive, and coders tend to feel empowered by the ability to build their own machines and teach themselves new skills. According to Vikram Chandra, coding can induce a state of flow, where the individual feels intensely focused on the present moment, masters their actions, and experiences intrinsic rewards. Flow is a psychological concept characterized by a sense of mastery, time dilation, and intrinsic motivation, which coders seem to experience when working on challenging problems. The mantra for this week's code philosophy is "code in flow," emphasizing the importance of embracing challenges as opportunities for growth and learning. Coders are not stupid for finding coding difficult; instead, they are driven by a passion for problem-solving and a sense of empowerment that comes from building their own skills. By adopting a mindset of flow and embracing challenges, coders can cultivate a sense of zen-like patience and mastery, leading to increased productivity and job satisfaction.

## Sleuth: important information Reading• . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-1/supplement/0fa5y/sleuth-important-information)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

Sleuth is an educational activity designed to teach programming fundamentals, where students play the role of private investigators solving code crimes in various cases. The primary mission is to use programming skills to solve puzzles and progress through the journey. Sleuth is a formative tool, meaning it will not directly affect grades, but completing all puzzles is highly recommended for learning experience. Two main entry points are available: Rookie mode (Week 2) for novice investigators and Pro mode (Week 12) for more experienced investigators. Students can access Sleuth at any time, but it's suggested to complete the cases in a structured order as outlined in the course schedule. To solve puzzles, students can use either Brackets or Visual Studio Code, with Visual Studio Code being recommended due to its modern and robust features. The instructor will introduce Sleuth in the next video, and completing all puzzles is crucial for grasping programming basics. As part of the project submission, students might be asked to discuss one of the crime puzzles as part of their module submission.

## Information about your assessments Reading• . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-1/supplement/OMvb7/information-about-your-assessments)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The module will feature both summative and formative assessments. Summative assessments contribute to the final grade, while formative assessments provide low-stakes practice and feedback on progress. The course has two major assessments: Coursework 1 (Week 12) worth 50% of the grade, and Coursework 2 (Week 22) also worth 50%. There are several graded activities with zero weighting, which are essential for learning but do not affect the final grade. A detailed breakdown of marks is provided, including estimated time per week and deadline weeks. The module will consist of approximately 2 hours of coursework each, divided between Coursework 1 and Coursework 2. Formative assessments include practice quizzes that provide feedback on progress and may explain why a particular answer was incorrect. The module's assessment schedule can be marked as completed or reported as an issue for support staff.

## Reflect on your learning Reading• . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-1/supplement/mE3bv/reflect-on-your-learning)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The student has successfully completed modules up to Lesson 1, covering setup of development toolkit and drawing with simple shapes using p5.js library. They should have also completed all 101 Sleuth cases, which involved understanding 2D coordinates and shape positioning accurately. To reflect on their learning, students can ask themselves questions like "How comfortable am I with setting up and using the development environment?" or "How do I feel about my ability to use shapes and the coordinate system in p5.js library?". Evaluating their learning will help identify areas that need improvement, which is a crucial skill for success in academics and professionals. To improve, students can develop concrete action plans such as scheduling additional study sessions, seeking out resources, or posting on the discussion forum for clarification. The course includes evaluation activities at the end of each topic to review progress and adjust strategies accordingly. Learning is a continuous process, and it's okay to revise one's plan as needed. By reflecting on their learning, students can set specific, measurable goals for improvement and achieve success in the rest of the course.

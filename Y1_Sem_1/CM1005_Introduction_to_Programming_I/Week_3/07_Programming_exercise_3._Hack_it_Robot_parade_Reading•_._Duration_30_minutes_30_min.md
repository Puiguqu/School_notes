This hack allows users to customize their own robots for participation in a robot parade. The goal is to transform the existing grey robots into a colorful parade using techniques learned from previous lessons. Users will work with RGB (red, green, and blue) colors, shapes, and programming concepts to achieve this. To get started, open the provided ZIP file and run the sketch to view the initial grey robot parade. The task requires making each robot on the parade unique in terms of body design. Additional learning materials are available for users to explore ellipse, rect, line, triangle, and point shapes, as well as setup, draw, and program flow concepts. Users can also access additional resources such as programming exercises, code examples, and discussion prompts to enhance their learning experience. The hack is designed to be completed within 30 minutes, with optional extensions available for further practice and exploration.

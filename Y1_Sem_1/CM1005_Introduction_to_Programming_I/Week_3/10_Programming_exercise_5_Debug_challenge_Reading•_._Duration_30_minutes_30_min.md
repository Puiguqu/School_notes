# Programming exercise 5: Debug challenge Readingâ€¢ . Duration: 30 minutes 30 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-1/supplement/MoI7e/programming-exercise-5-debug-challenge)

There is not enough text provided to summarize and preserve all key information, formulae, links, and technical details. However, I can provide a summary of the context:

The text appears to be related to debugging a code snippet for a programming exercise, specifically "debugChallengeT2 ZIP File". The task involves identifying and fixing bugs in the code using techniques learned from previous lectures. Some of the bugs are syntax errors, while others have logic errors that need to be addressed.

If you provide more context or the actual text of the code, I would be happy to help summarize it in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details.

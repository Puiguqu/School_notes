The video transcript guides viewers through solving Case 303, also known as the Crooked Attorney case, in a programming language. The goal is to crack safes hidden across town by finding incriminating documents stored in various safe locations. To start, the program requires variables `Cryptic_Store_CombA` and `Cryptic_Store_CombB`, which may have different variable names in different puzzles. The first step involves running a "sketch" to understand the problem, which is an interactive simulation of the crime scene. In this sketch, the safe's state can be observed by pressing mouse buttons, such as releasing or dragging the mouse. By analyzing these actions, it becomes clear that `Cryptic_Store_CombA` should be set to specific values when certain conditions are met, using events like `mouseReleased`. Once the code is written and saved, the program can be tested and refined until all safes have been cracked, achieving 37.5% completion. The video tutorial provides a step-by-step guide to solving this puzzle and encourages viewers to try it on their own, with additional resources available for further learning.

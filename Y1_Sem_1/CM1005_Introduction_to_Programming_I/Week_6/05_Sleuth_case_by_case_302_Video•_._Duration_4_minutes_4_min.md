Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The video transcript presents a puzzle involving a detective and a bank heist scene. The goal is to adjust the x-coordinate of the spotlight to land on Sergy Minsky by iteratively reducing the value of x using plus or minus equals. The initial coordinates for the start and end positions are 89,111 (detective) and 289,110 (Sergy Minsky), respectively. To animate the spotlight, a variable x is initialized with the starting coordinate and then reduced by 1 pixel at a time, moving it from right to left across the scene. The y-coordinate can also be adjusted independently using plus or minus equals for accurate movement at the correct angle. In this puzzle, only the x-coordinates are of interest, making adjustments simpler. The video provides step-by-step instructions on how to solve the puzzle in Visual Studio Code using the Sleuth tool, with examples and solutions available for download (case 302). By adjusting the x-coordinate in increments, the spotlight can be precisely positioned over Sergy Minsky at the end of the animation.

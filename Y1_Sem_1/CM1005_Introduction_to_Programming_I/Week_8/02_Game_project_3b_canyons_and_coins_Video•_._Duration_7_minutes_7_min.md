Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The instructor guides students to continue working on Game Project Three, building upon their previous work by adding interaction between the game character and collectables. They copy the `collectable` code from Project Two Part B into the current sketch file for Game Project Three. The instructor explains that they want to add a property called `isFound` to the collectable object and set its value to `false`. They then create an if statement to draw the collectable only when `isFound` is `false`, allowing the character to pick up the collectable. To implement this, they use the `dist` function to calculate the distance between the character's position and the collectable's position, setting the condition for drawing the collectable to be less than 20 pixels. Once the collectable has been found, its `isFound` value is set to `true`, preventing it from being drawn again. The instructor notes that there are additional tasks to complete in Game Project Three, including drawing the canyon and testing falling down the canyon.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The case "Why Gang Ruby Heist" from the game project involves a detective running through Console City to catch a ruby thief. The script uses an if statement to determine whether the current road equals Huffman Street, giving the detective a direction to travel east. To turn the detective onto Packard Avenue, another if statement is used with a condition checking for Packard Avenue, setting the direction to south. However, without additional code, Matz gets away. Adding an else if clause or an else condition can improve the script's clarity and extend its functionality. The script has successfully turned the detective onto Adele Street, going west, but will run out of steam without a final direction. A larger if statement with multiple conditions can be used to turn the detective onto Reynolds Street as well, allowing them to continue their pursuit. By submitting this solution, Sleuth yields 75% accuracy, indicating that the script has correctly navigated three corners.

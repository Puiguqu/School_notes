Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The speaker guides viewers through solving "Case 403", also known as the Shiffman stakeout. The goal is to sound an alarm when the criminal mastermind, Shiffman, crosses Adele Street from west to east. To achieve this, the viewer must draw a cyan rectangle covering the entire map from Adele Street to the west. A conditional statement is used to check if Shiffman's position (represented by a red dot) has crossed over Adele Street to the left of its current x-coordinate (1721). The code uses a simple if-statement with `mouseX` to determine this. Once the alarm is triggered, a cyan rectangle is drawn using the `rect()` function, covering the entire map from Adele Street to the west. The rectangle's width and height are determined by the map's dimensions and Shiffman's x-coordinate. By following these steps, the viewer can successfully sound the alarm when Shiffman crosses Adele Street.

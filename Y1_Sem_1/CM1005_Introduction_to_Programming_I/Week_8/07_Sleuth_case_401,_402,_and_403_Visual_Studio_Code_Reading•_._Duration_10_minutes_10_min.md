# Sleuth case 401, 402, and 403: Visual Studio Code Readingâ€¢ . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-1/supplement/nMKKS/sleuth-case-401-402-and-403-visual-studio-code)

There is no text to summarize in this case. The provided text appears to be a list of lessons, videos, and reading materials related to the Sleuth application, but it does not contain any specific information or key concepts that need to be summarized.

However, I can provide a summary of the content:

The text invites users to complete three case series (401, 402, and 403) from the Sleuth application. Users have the option to use either Brackets or Visual Studio Code as their code editor, but are recommended to use Visual Studio Code due to its modernity and support.

The activities include watching videos (7 minutes, 4 minutes, and 5 minutes), reading materials (10 minutes each), and discussing a topic related to Sleuth cases. Users can mark the completion of these tasks, dislike them if needed, or report any issues encountered.

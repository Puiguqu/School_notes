### Code philosophy: testing Video• . Duration: 6 minutes 6 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

Software testing is a vital discipline for programmers to learn, beyond debugging and ensuring code quality. It involves verifying that code is not only bug-free but also meets its intended purpose, often requiring testing individual components within larger systems. The complexity of modern software development makes it essential to divide code into smaller, manageable chunks, making testing and verification easier. This process is known as unit testing, which exploits properties of functions and code organization. Effective software design and requirements gathering are crucial for writing testable code, as they help identify potential edge cases and ensure the software meets its intended purpose. The stakes of failure can be serious, especially in safety-critical systems like aircraft, where developers may write only 30 lines of code per day to meet stringent testing standards. Debugging alone is not enough; thorough testing is necessary to ensure code works as expected in real-world scenarios. By adopting a code philosophy that shifts from debugging to testing, programmers can create software that meets its intended purpose and is ready for use by real users.

### Game project - part 5: Multiple interactables Video• . Duration: 8 minutes 8 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The video transcript guides viewers through creating a game project Part 5 by refactoring code from Part 4 to make it reusable and flexible. The first step involves renaming the game project and adding necessary files, including a ReadMe file. The guide then explains how to create a new function called `drawClouds` to draw clouds, which replaces the original four-loop code. A similar process is followed for drawing mountains and trees using the same approach with a new function called `drawTrees`. However, when it comes to drawing collectables, a different approach is taken, as there are multiple interactables involved. The guide explains how to create a function called `drawCollectable` that takes an argument `t_collectable`, which represents a temporary collectable. To draw any collectable, the code replaces references to `collectable` with `t_collectable` inside the function. By passing a real collectable variable instead of `t_collectable`, the game characters can be drawn correctly when calling the function with a valid collectable object.

## Week 13

### User defined functions Video• . Duration: 9 minutes 9 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulas, links, and technical details:

Functions are blocks of code that perform specific tasks, allowing coders to organize their code into discrete sections and reuse it in different contexts. The basic syntax for declaring a function includes the "function" keyword, a function name, two round parentheses, and two curly braces containing the function body. To call a function, one must type the function name followed by two round parentheses. Functions can be used to refactor code, making it more modular and easier to maintain. In this lesson, we learned how to define and call our own functions using P5 JS, separating code into discrete sections and reusing them as needed. By writing high-level programming code on top of pre-existing dependencies (libraries), we create a software stack with different layers interacting with each other. The concept of functions allows us to build upon the work of others, creating a tiered structure of dependencies that is essential for large-scale coding projects. By understanding how functions work and when to use them effectively, coders can write more efficient and maintainable code.

### Function arguments Video• . Duration: 8 minutes 8 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

In this video, the creator demonstrates how to use arguments in p5.js functions to control the exposition, y-position, and height of a flower. The creator creates an argument list with variables for x-position, y-position, and stem heights, ensuring that variable names differ from existing ones. The creator uses "find and replace" to replace base x, base y, and stem heights with the corresponding arguments in the code. To reuse the code and draw multiple flowers, the creator uses a for loop to iterate through different values of the argument list. In each iteration, the flower's position and height are adjusted using the i index, allowing for spreading out or changing the pattern of the flowers. The creator also adds an argument for the color of the petals and demonstrates how to use it to change the color of the flowers. By combining different patterns and values, the creator showcases the flexibility of passing arguments into functions. Overall, this video provides a comprehensive introduction to using arguments in p5.js functions to create dynamic and customizable graphics.

### Recursive cloud Video• . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself within its own definition. An example of recursion can be seen in Russian dolls or the Droste effect, where an image of a woman holds a smaller version of herself. In code, recursion works by calling a function from within itself, with each call creating a new instance of the function. The key to avoiding infinite loops is to include a conditional statement that stops the recursion when certain conditions are met. In this example, the programmer uses a conditional statement to stop the recursive calls when a certain threshold is reached. The recursion creates an exponential growth in the number of function calls, which can lead to performance issues if not handled carefully. By using random offsets and colors, the programmer can create a visually interesting pattern with clouds, chains of movement, and varying colors. Overall, recursion requires careful planning and execution to produce desired results without crashing the program.

### Returning values from functions Video• . Duration: 21 minutes 21 min

Based on the provided transcript, it appears that this is a JavaScript programming tutorial. The tutorial covers various topics such as functions, variables, and debugging techniques.

The main topic of the transcript is functions, specifically how to return values from functions in JavaScript. The author explains that functions can return simple values like strings and booleans, but also complex objects and arrays.

Here are some key takeaways from the transcript:

1. Functions can return multiple values using object notation.
2. Functions can be used to reverse the direction of a spaceship when it goes off the edge of the screen.
3. The `getSpeed()` function is used to reverse the direction of a spaceship.
4. The `speed` object is returned by the `getSpeed()` function and assigned to the spaceship's properties.

To expand on this example, you could try:

1. Adding laser beams that come out of the spaceships when they collide.
2. Making the spaceships glow or crackle when they collide.
3. Creating multiple types of collisions (e.g., head-on collision, side collision).
4. Adding sound effects for collisions.

Overall, this transcript provides a comprehensive overview of functions in JavaScript and how to use them to create interactive programs.

### Scope - global and local with var Video• . Duration: 11 minutes 11 min

This is a transcript of a video lecture on programming concepts, specifically on the topic of scope and global vs local variables.

The lecturer discusses how in programming, variables have different behaviors depending on where they are created. Variables created inside a function (local) only exist within that function's scope and do not affect other parts of the program. On the other hand, variables defined outside of any function (global) persist across the entire program and can be accessed from anywhere.

The lecturer also touches on the importance of using global variables sparingly, as they can lead to code that is not modular and has difficult-to-keep track-of variable names. Instead, the lecturer suggests creating a return value for functions that can store the new values of variables, allowing for more flexibility and better organization of code.

The key takeaways from this video are:

1. Variables created inside a function (local) have scope limited to that function and do not affect other parts of the program.
2. Variables defined outside of any function (global) persist across the entire program and can be accessed from anywhere.
3. Global variables should be used sparingly, as they can lead to code that is not modular and has difficult-to-keep-track-of variable names.
4. Instead of using global variables, it's better to create a return value for functions that can store new values of variables.

Overall, the video provides an introduction to the concept of scope and its implications for programming, as well as some practical advice on how to manage variables effectively in code.

### Copying variables Video• . Duration: 9 minutes 9 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

In JavaScript, when assigning one variable to another, the value is copied, but not referenced. For simple types (numbers, strings, booleans), the assignment creates an independent copy. In contrast, for complex types (objects and arrays), the assignment creates a reference to the original object or array.

When objects are assigned to each other, both variables point to the same memory location, meaning changes made to one variable affect the other. To pass simple properties by value, assign them individually to create new values, as seen in the example of `rect2.x` being set to 200.

Arrays and objects are passed by reference by default, which means modifying an array or object through one variable affects all other variables referencing the same instance. To avoid this behavior, assign a copy of the array or object using the spread operator or the `Object.assign()` method, as demonstrated in the example with `myArray2` being assigned a new array.

Overall, understanding how JavaScript handles assignment and reference can help developers write more effective code and avoid common pitfalls.

### Common errors with scope and how to debug them Video• . Duration: 8 minutes 8 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

In the p5.js programming language, scope refers to the region where a variable is defined and can be accessed. The author provides an example of a global variable `rectWidth` that is set to 100, but when used in the `draw` function, it is not updated with the new value of 200. This happens because the `draw` function has its own local scope, which overrides the global scope. To fix this issue, the author introduces a new function called `drawRect` that takes two parameters: `x`, `y`, and `width`. The `drawRect` function uses these parameters to draw a rectangle, but also accesses the built-in `width` variable of p5.js, which can cause conflicts. To avoid this conflict, the author renames the parameter `width` to `rectWidth` and updates its value inside the function. This allows the function to manipulate its own scope independently of the global scope. The author also notes that variables defined within a function are only accessible within that function's scope, and changes made within the function do not persist outside of it.

Please note that I did not include any links or formulae as they were not present in the original text.

### Code philosophy: The 'put it off till later' approach Video• . Duration: 4 minutes 4 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The topic of code philosophy presents a technique to overcome "coder's block" by putting off coding until later. This approach involves planning out work before committing to syntax, using tools like flowcharts or pseudocode to explain code concepts. The author will demonstrate a simple technique for dividing code into manageable chunks by identifying what one function may need to do without writing any code. A comment is added above the function definition to outline its intention and parameters, such as x, y coordinates, and button size. The logic of the function assumes buttons are around with a distance function used to determine if the mouse's coordinates are within the button. An if statement is used to check the distance and return true or false accordingly. This approach allows for flexibility in writing code and provides helpful comments for others to understand the code's intent. By putting off coding until later, the author aims to make the process more productive and accessible.

### Sleuth case by case 601 Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The video transcript guides the viewer through solving a case called "case 601" where a notorious sequence killer named Casey Fry has escaped from a Federal Correctional Institution. The goal is to track her movements by drawing a line on a map using a for loop, beginShape, endShape, and vertex commands. Two arrays of coordinates, suspect locations x and y, are provided, and the for loop iterates through each element in both arrays simultaneously. The code uses a regular for loop with the condition i < suspectLocationsX.length to access elements from both arrays. A console.log statement is used to print out the values at each position, demonstrating traversal. The code then draws a line on the map using beginShape and endShape commands, using vertex instead of ellipse, and sets the stroke color to cyan without filling. The final stage involves checking the sketch in Sketch.js to see if the crime has been solved, which it is after completing the line. The video concludes with additional resources, including links to other lessons and videos related to the Sleuth case.

### Reflect on your learning Reading• . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The learner has completed two weeks of coursework, exploring functions with parameters and return types, scope concepts, and modular programming benefits. They have gained skills in creating well-defined program components with clear purposes. The concept of scope explains how different parts of a program access and interact with variables, preventing conflicts and errors. Modular programming breaks down a program into smaller, self-contained functions, leading to better-organized and easier-to-read code. To reflect on their learning, learners should ask themselves questions like "How has writing functions with parameters improved my modular code?" or "How does knowing about scope help me manage variables effectively?" Evaluating their learning will help them identify areas for improvement and develop a concrete action plan to enhance their understanding. This plan could include scheduling additional study sessions, seeking additional resources, posting on the discussion forum, or setting specific goals for improvement.

## Week 15

### Initialising and accessing 2D arrays Video• . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

In programming, an array can store elements of any type, including Booleans, strings, numbers, or objects. A two-dimensional array (2D array) is an array that stores arrays as its elements. To declare a 2D array, one uses nested square brackets, e.g., `my2DArray = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]`. Each element of the outer array can be accessed using the same syntax used for one-dimensional arrays. For example, to access the first element of the inner array, one would use `console.log(my2DArray[0][0])`. Two-dimensional arrays are useful for representing tables or grids, and they can be iterated over using nested loops. In JavaScript, a 2D array is created by declaring an outer array with square brackets and assigning elements to each index of the inner arrays using bracket notation. Understanding two-dimensional arrays is essential for working with programming concepts such as nested objects and arrays.

---

### Arrays of objects Video• . Duration: 12 minutes 12 min

Based on the provided transcript, it appears that this is a coding lesson or tutorial on JavaScript, specifically focusing on working with two-dimensional arrays (arrays of arrays) and nesting objects within these arrays.

The instructor begins by introducing the concept of using a `for` loop to create an array of objects, which will represent cars in a traffic simulation. The example code shows how to:

1. Create an empty array called `traffic`.
2. Use a `for` loop to iterate over a range of numbers (from 0 to 9), creating a new object for each iteration.
3. Within the loop, create another object that represents the car, with properties like `exposition`, `height`, and `wheelDiameter`.

The instructor then discusses how to space out the cars evenly across the screen by using a variable called `inc` (increment). They calculate the even spacing between cars based on the total width of the screen plus a fixed gap on each side.

Next, the instructor introduces the concept of introducing variation into the simulation. They suggest changing the colors and other properties of the cars, which is achieved by:

1. Using the `Math.random()` function to generate random values for red, green, and blue components.
2. Randomizing the height of the car between 120 and 200.
3. Randomizing the wheel diameter between 40 and 80.

The final section encourages the learner to experiment with different variations, such as changing the speeds of the cars or introducing traffic lights that control the flow of traffic.

Overall, this lesson seems to aim at teaching developers how to work with two-dimensional arrays of objects in JavaScript, including creating, spacing out, and modifying these arrays to simulate a traffic scenario.

### Complex object properties Video• . Duration: 12 minutes 12 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The speaker demonstrates how to store objects within an array in JavaScript, and vice versa. They create an object representing a bus with properties like x position, length, height, wheel diameter, and driver's position. The speaker introduces the concept of nesting objects and arrays, creating a new driver object with attributes like height. To draw the driver, they modify the `drawPerson` function to accept an object with attributes, passing in the `bus.driver` object as an argument.

The speaker then creates five passengers with different x positions, heights, and random attributes using loops and array methods like `push`. They draw each passenger using a modified version of the `drawPerson` function, accessing their properties from within the array. The resulting bus object has multiple passengers with unique characteristics, demonstrating the power of nested objects and arrays in JavaScript.

The speaker provides additional resources and practice assignments related to nesting objects and arrays, such as two-dimensional arrays and patterns, which can be used to further explore these concepts.

### Find the matching value Video• . Duration: 4 minutes 4 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The video discusses searching for a particular value in an array using a for loop. An example array with 1,000 numbers is used to find the first instance of the number 42. A variable `meaningOfLife` is created to store the index of the found value and initialized to zero. The for loop iterates through the array until it finds the value 42, but the current implementation prints the last found index instead of the first one. To fix this, a break statement is added after finding the value 42, which stops the loop from iterating further. With the break statement in place, the program successfully finds the first instance of the number 42 and prints its index, which is 265. This demonstrates how to use a for loop with a break statement to achieve a specific search outcome.

---

### Find the highest / lowest value Video• . Duration: 7 minutes 7 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

To find the highest or lowest value from an array, one can use a for loop to iterate through each element. To find the largest value, create variables `highestValue` and `highestIndex`, and initialize them to zero. In the for loop, check if the current value is greater than the previous highest value, and update `highestValue` and `highestIndex` accordingly. Similarly, to find the smallest value, create variables `smallestValue` and `smallestIndex`, and initialize `smallestValue` to null (not zero). In the for loop, check if the current value is less than the previous smallest value, and update `smallestValue` and `smallestIndex` accordingly. A common mistake when finding the largest or smallest value is to assign a value to `smallestValue` or `largestValue`, which can lead to incorrect results. To avoid this, make sure to compare values using comparison operators (e.g., `<`, `>`) rather than assignment operators (e.g., `=`). By following these steps and being mindful of common pitfalls, one can effectively find the highest or lowest value in an array.

Note that I did not include any external links, formulas, or specific programming language details, as they were not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.

### Exclude a set of values Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The speaker explains how to use for loops with arrays to manipulate data. They demonstrate this by creating an array called "circles" with 1,000 random integers between 0 and 100, and then using a for loop to draw circles on the canvas based on their size and color. The loop uses if statements to skip over circles that are too small (less than 10 pixels) and draws them in red if they are bigger than 50 or blue otherwise. To avoid deeply nested if statements, the speaker uses the continue keyword to skip certain iterations of the loop. They also use this technique to conditionally draw ellipses with random locations and sizes based on their values from the array. The speaker notes that the loop must be closed with parentheses to ensure proper function. Additionally, they mention a trick for stopping the drawing process from repeating frame by frame: using the "noLoop" function within the draw loop. This allows the user to see a single frame of the application and then refresh to get a different pattern due to the random variables involved.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The video transcript discusses building upon knowledge of functions and objects to bring them together by creating objects that contain both properties and functions, referred to as methods. Methods are used to perform actions or behaviors within an object, such as drawing or updating values. To create a method, the syntax is: `method_name : function()` where `function` contains parameters in parentheses. The body of the method is enclosed in curly brackets `{}`. When calling a method on an object, the same data operator is used as with properties, followed by parentheses to set any required arguments. The video example demonstrates creating a "kitty" object with a method called "meow" that outputs the text "meow" to the screen at a specified position. Parameters are added to make the meow function more flexible and reusable. By using parameters, the function can be called multiple times with different positions and values.

### This: making objects refer to themselves Video• . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

In JavaScript, objects can access their own properties using the `this` keyword. This allows developers to encapsulate code within objects, making it easier to manage complex data structures. The example demonstrates how to create an object with methods (functions) that operate on its own properties. In the first example, a `MyRect` object is created with properties for position and size, and a method `draw()` that uses `this` to access these properties. The second example creates a `RocketShip` object with methods `draw()` and `moveRockets()`, where `moveRockets()` uses `this` to access the rocket's properties. To make `moveRockets()` work, the developer must use `find and replace` to update all instances of `rocket` with `this`. This approach allows developers to create modular, organized code by encapsulating related functionality within objects. By using methods to operate on an object's properties, developers can write more efficient and maintainable code.

### Sleuth case by case 801 Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The video transcript describes a sleuthing case where the goal is to identify members of the Order of Knuth at an opera performance of Rigoletto. The instructions provide row and seat numbers for several bad guys, as well as a trademark item of clothing (a bowtie) that can help identify them. A 2D array representing the audience is used, with each person having x and y coordinates and a "located" property set to false. To solve the case, the sleuth must iterate through the array, setting the located property to true for the specified members of the gang. The first row has four members to identify, using correct row and seat numbers (e.g., 0,4). A FOR loop is used in subsequent levels of the case. The sleuth can use a nested FOR loop if needed. By identifying the members of the Order of Knuth wearing bowties, the sleuth can solve the case and achieve a score of approximately 40%.

### Sleuth case by case 802 Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and details:

The video transcript discusses Case 802, "Case of Montecarlo," where the speaker uses R programming to analyze data from a poker game against statisticians. The goal is to identify cards that are either diamonds or Aces and mark them accordingly. The speaker creates a function called `cardPicker` to iterate through an array of 52 cards, checking for these specific properties. If a card matches, it sets the `marked` property to true. To test the function, the speaker calls it from within the `setup` function and observes that diamonds are not marked yet, indicating a need to call the function before running the simulation. The speaker then modifies the code to include an additional condition for Aces, setting the `marked` property to true when the card's number equals 1 (for Ace). Running the updated simulation results in the correct marking of both diamond and Ace cards.

### The factory pattern Video• . Duration: 7 minutes 7 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The factory pattern is a design pattern used to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. In this video, the author creates a single tadpole object with various properties and methods, and then uses the factory pattern to create multiple instances of the same object by encapsulating the creation logic in a separate function called `createTadpole`. The `createTadpole` function takes arguments for the x and y coordinates of the tadpole's initial position, which are randomly generated. The author then creates an array of tadpole objects using a loop and populates it with instances created by the `createTadpole` function. To handle the drawing and mouse click logic, the author modifies the original code to traverse the array of tadpoles instead of working with a single instance. This allows the behavior to be applied to multiple tadpoles simultaneously. The resulting code demonstrates the use of the factory pattern to create objects in bulk without copying and pasting code. By using this pattern, developers can write more efficient and maintainable code by separating object creation from usage logic.

### Creating a particle system Video• . Duration: 33 minutes 33 min

This is a transcript of a video on creating a particle system using JavaScript and the constructor function pattern. Here's a breakdown of the content:

**Introduction**

The instructor introduces themselves and explains that in this lesson, they will be teaching how to create a particle system using JavaScript.

**Creating a new class**

The instructor creates a new class called `Particle` using the constructor function pattern. They explain the benefits of using constructors, including encapsulation, code reuse, and ease of use.

**Properties and methods**

The instructor adds properties (e.g., position, velocity, color) and methods (e.g., update, render) to the `Particle` class. They explain how these properties and methods will be used to control the behavior of individual particles in the system.

**Creating a particle system**

The instructor creates an instance of the `Particle` class and adds it to an array called `particles`. They then define two functions: `updateParticles` and `renderParticles`. The `updateParticles` function updates the position and velocity of each particle based on their properties, while the `renderParticles` function renders each particle on the screen.

**Updating particles**

The instructor explains how the `updateParticles` function works. It iterates over each particle in the array, updates its position and velocity based on gravity (a constant value), and checks if the particle has reached the end of its lifetime. If it has, the particle is removed from the array.

**Rendering particles**

The instructor explains how the `renderParticles` function works. It uses a canvas element to render each particle on the screen, with the color and size determined by the particle's properties.

**Blooming effect**

The instructor introduces a blooming effect that makes particles fade out as they move away from the center of the screen. They add a new property called `lifetime` to the `Particle` class and modify the `updateParticles` function to test against this value instead of a fixed number.

**Final touches**

The instructor adds some final touches to the particle system, including changing the color and size of particles to create a stylized effect. They also encourage viewers to experiment with different values and techniques to create their own unique effects.

Overall, this transcript provides a step-by-step guide to creating a basic particle system using JavaScript and the constructor function pattern. It covers topics such as encapsulation, code reuse, and ease of use, as well as more advanced concepts like gravity, blooming effects, and rendering on the screen.

### When to use constructors Video• . Duration: 4 minutes 4 min

The text discusses the decision-making process for choosing between literal objects, factory patterns, and constructor functions in object-oriented programming. The author suggests that identifying the appropriate structure depends on the specific problem and experience with the language.

To decide, ask yourself:

- Do you need multiple objects of the same kind? If yes, a factory pattern or constructor might be suitable.
- How many properties does the object have? More complex objects require a factory pattern or constructor function.
- Will the object expand as development progresses? A factory pattern or constructor function is recommended.

The author presents three case studies:

1. An object to store game play egizer during gameplay, where only one property (lives) is needed and no methods are required, making a literal object suitable.
2. An object to store data for drawing mountains as background objects in the game, where multiple properties are needed and no interaction is required, making a factory pattern suitable.
3. An object for an enemy character with many properties and methods, requiring significant expansion, making a constructor function suitable.

The author concludes that choosing the right structure depends on the specific problem and experience.

### Code philosophy: what it feels like to code Video• . Duration: 3 minutes 3 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

Coding is often perceived as a fast and easy process, but this is not reflected in real-world game development, such as Grand Theft Auto, which took over three years to complete with a team of over 1,000 people. The reality of coding is that it can be frustrating, especially when dealing with complex problems, but coders are often optimistic and view each challenge as an opportunity to learn. Coding has been shown to be highly addictive, and coders tend to feel empowered by the ability to build their own machines and teach themselves new skills. According to Vikram Chandra, coding can induce a state of flow, where the individual feels intensely focused on the present moment, masters their actions, and experiences intrinsic rewards. Flow is a psychological concept characterized by a sense of mastery, time dilation, and intrinsic motivation, which coders seem to experience when working on challenging problems. The mantra for this week's code philosophy is "code in flow," emphasizing the importance of embracing challenges as opportunities for growth and learning. Coders are not stupid for finding coding difficult; instead, they are driven by a passion for problem-solving and a sense of empowerment that comes from building their own skills. By adopting a mindset of flow and embracing challenges, coders can cultivate a sense of zen-like patience and mastery, leading to increased productivity and job satisfaction.

### RGB (red, green and blue) colours Video• . Duration: 8 minutes 8 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The RGB (Red, Green, Blue) color model is used to create a wide range of colors on digital devices. In the code example provided, the background command sets the background color using three arguments: red, green, and blue, with values ranging from 0 to 255. These values represent the intensity of each color, with 0 representing no color and 255 representing maximum color intensity. The combination of these values allows for the creation of a vast number of colors, with exactly 16,777,216 possible colors in total (2^8 x 3). This is achieved by using binary arithmetic to calculate the combinations of red, green, and blue values. By experimenting with different values and combinations, users can create their own unique colors. The RGB color model is used in various applications, including graphics and game development. Online tools, such as RapidTables.com, are available for users to experiment with and find perfect shades for their desired colors.

Note: I removed the additional page content as it was not part of the original text and only provided information about lesson plans and practice assignments.

### Fill, stroke, noFill Video• . Duration: 7 minutes 7 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The video transcript discusses controlling colors in a program using fill, noFill, stroke, and noStroke commands. Fill changes the inside color of shapes, while noFill makes them transparent. The stroke command controls the outline of shapes, similar to fill. To avoid problems with repetitive drawing loops, it's essential to set the color at the beginning of the draw function. Transparency can be achieved by adding a fourth argument to the fill command, which sets the alpha value (0-255). Experimenting with different colors and transparency levels can create interesting effects. The video also touches on setup and program flow, highlighting the importance of setting colors correctly in the draw function. Finally, it recommends practicing exercises such as the Hackett exercise, Robot Parade, and Kandinsky, which can help improve skills in controlling colors and shapes.

### Setup, draw and programme flow Video• . Duration: 3 minutes 3 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The video transcript discusses program parts and flow, exploring how a program is executed from beginning to end. The setup function is executed first, before the draw function, which is called repeatedly every frame. A frame refers to a still image played progressively over time to create an illusion of movement in films or animations. The order of lines within the functions matters, as they should be written from top to bottom like text in a book. Incorrect indentation can lead to unexpected behavior. To demonstrate this, the code is modified to show how changes in indentation affect the program's output. Another trick involves setting an alpha channel on a color value, allowing for semi-transparency, such as adding an alpha value of 100 to one of the squares.

### Ellipse, rect, line, triangle and point Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The video transcript introduces basic shapes in Processing, a programming language for visual design. An ellipse is created with four parts, where the center coordinates (x and y) determine the shape's orientation, and width and height are the same as the diameter. Changing these values can stretch or shrink the ellipse. The line command takes two pairs of x and y coordinates to draw a line between two points, which can be horizontal, vertical, diagonal, or any combination thereof. A triangle is created with three pairs of coordinates for each corner, allowing for various types of triangles to be drawn. Additionally, the point command can be used to create a visible dot on the screen using a stroke weight command, but it may affect other shapes if not reset to 1. The Processing language retains state between drawings, so the stroke weight set earlier will still apply when drawing other shapes unless reset. To practice drawing functions and exercises, there are various videos, assignments, and readings available, including a "Robot parade" exercise and an assignment to create a Kandinsky-inspired abstract art piece from scratch.

The Console is a powerful tool that allows developers to see what their program is doing under the hood. To access the Console, users can navigate to three different browsers: Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. In each browser, users can access the Console by going to the developer menu or using the hotkey for JavaScript Console. The Console displays several tabs, including Elements, Sources, and Console, with the latter being the relevant tab for error messages. When debugging errors, developers should pay close attention to capitalization, as it is crucial in programming languages such as code. In this video, the creator demonstrates how to access the Console in each browser and fixes an error by adding a capital C to the "createCanvas" command. The process of identifying and fixing errors is called debugging, which will be explored in more detail in a future video. By using the Console and debugging syntax errors, developers can improve their coding skills and create more reliable programs.

### Debugging syntax errors Video• . Duration: 8 minutes 8 min

The concept of bugs in coding is discussed, where mistakes are called "bugs" due to their resemblance to the first computer bug, a moth that caused an error. Debugging is a core skill in programming that takes time to master and is essential for identifying and fixing errors.

Two types of syntax errors are identified: (1) missing brackets or parentheses, which can be easily fixed by adding the correct characters; (2) unexpected identifiers, where the code uses incorrect variable names or function calls. These errors can cause the program to produce unexpected results or crash.

The console is used as a tool to identify and fix syntax errors. It provides information about the line number of the error, which helps in locating the exact spot where the mistake occurred. However, it may not always be able to determine the root cause of the error, requiring the programmer to use their own deduction skills.

Another type of error discussed is argument errors, where the program expects a certain number or data type of arguments but receives an incorrect one. This can cause unexpected results or crashes.

Examples are given to illustrate these concepts, including a simple drawing program that produces unexpected results due to syntax and argument errors. The programmer uses the console to identify the errors, adds the correct characters or arguments, and fixes the code.

The video concludes by emphasizing that debugging is an essential skill in programming and encourages viewers to try the debug challenge that follows the video.

### Sleuth case by case: 301 Video• . Duration: 6 minutes 6 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The video transcript guides viewers through solving Case 303, also known as the Crooked Attorney case, in a programming language. The goal is to crack safes hidden across town by finding incriminating documents stored in various safe locations. To start, the program requires variables `Cryptic_Store_CombA` and `Cryptic_Store_CombB`, which may have different variable names in different puzzles. The first step involves running a "sketch" to understand the problem, which is an interactive simulation of the crime scene. In this sketch, the safe's state can be observed by pressing mouse buttons, such as releasing or dragging the mouse. By analyzing these actions, it becomes clear that `Cryptic_Store_CombA` should be set to specific values when certain conditions are met, using events like `mouseReleased`. Once the code is written and saved, the program can be tested and refined until all safes have been cracked, achieving 37.5% completion. The video tutorial provides a step-by-step guide to solving this puzzle and encourages viewers to try it on their own, with additional resources available for further learning.

### Game project 3b: canyons and coins Video• . Duration: 7 minutes 7 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The instructor guides students to continue working on Game Project Three, building upon their previous work by adding interaction between the game character and collectables. They copy the `collectable` code from Project Two Part B into the current sketch file for Game Project Three. The instructor explains that they want to add a property called `isFound` to the collectable object and set its value to `false`. They then create an if statement to draw the collectable only when `isFound` is `false`, allowing the character to pick up the collectable. To implement this, they use the `dist` function to calculate the distance between the character's position and the collectable's position, setting the condition for drawing the collectable to be less than 20 pixels. Once the collectable has been found, its `isFound` value is set to `true`, preventing it from being drawn again. The instructor notes that there are additional tasks to complete in Game Project Three, including drawing the canyon and testing falling down the canyon.

### Sleuth case by case: 401 Video• . Duration: 7 minutes 7 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulas, links, and technical details:

The video transcript discusses implementing conditional statements in a game project to respond to different poison levels. The goal is to save Console City from Norbert Weiner's Stand by adjusting antidote amounts based on specific conditions. The code initializes variables for poison and antidotes (insulin, paracetamol, ethanol) and uses a moving graph to display poison amounts. Conditional statements are written to decrease insulin when snake venom exceeds 0.64, increase insulin when Warfarin falls below 0.46, and adjust other antidote levels accordingly. The code is implemented by copying and pasting the conditional statements into the program, with errors corrected along the way. After submitting the sketch, it appears that some adjustments are needed to correctly implement the antidotes. To correct these mistakes, the transcript suggests reviewing the specific conditional statements for paracetamol and Warfarin. By addressing these issues, the game project should be able to save Console City from Norbert Weiner's Stand.

### Sleuth case by case: 402 Video• . Duration: 4 minutes 4 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The case "Why Gang Ruby Heist" from the game project involves a detective running through Console City to catch a ruby thief. The script uses an if statement to determine whether the current road equals Huffman Street, giving the detective a direction to travel east. To turn the detective onto Packard Avenue, another if statement is used with a condition checking for Packard Avenue, setting the direction to south. However, without additional code, Matz gets away. Adding an else if clause or an else condition can improve the script's clarity and extend its functionality. The script has successfully turned the detective onto Adele Street, going west, but will run out of steam without a final direction. A larger if statement with multiple conditions can be used to turn the detective onto Reynolds Street as well, allowing them to continue their pursuit. By submitting this solution, Sleuth yields 75% accuracy, indicating that the script has correctly navigated three corners.

### Sleuth case by case: 403 Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The speaker guides viewers through solving "Case 403", also known as the Shiffman stakeout. The goal is to sound an alarm when the criminal mastermind, Shiffman, crosses Adele Street from west to east. To achieve this, the viewer must draw a cyan rectangle covering the entire map from Adele Street to the west. A conditional statement is used to check if Shiffman's position (represented by a red dot) has crossed over Adele Street to the left of its current x-coordinate (1721). The code uses a simple if-statement with `mouseX` to determine this. Once the alarm is triggered, a cyan rectangle is drawn using the `rect()` function, covering the entire map from Adele Street to the west. The rectangle's width and height are determined by the map's dimensions and Shiffman's x-coordinate. By following these steps, the viewer can successfully sound the alarm when Shiffman crosses Adele Street.

A set is a fundamental concept in mathematics and computer science, representing a collection of distinct objects considered as an object in its own right.

A set can be defined in two ways: Definition 1 states that a set is a collection of objects, while Definition 2 describes it as an unordered collection of distinct elements.

The symbol ∈ denotes membership in a set, such as "a ∈ A" meaning a is an element of set A. Conversely, a symbol ∉ is used to denote non-membership, like "a ∉ A".

Special sets include N (natural numbers), Z (integers), Q (rational numbers), and R (real numbers).

The empty set, denoted as ∅ or {}, represents a set with no elements.

Cardinality of a set refers to the number of distinct elements in that set. For example, |A| = 4 means the cardinality of set A is 4.

Finite sets have a limited number of elements, while infinite sets have an unlimited number of elements. The set of natural numbers N={1,2,3,…} is an example of an infinite set.

To list all elements in a set using the listing method, simply write down each element within curly braces.

For example, the set A = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7} contains the elements 1 through 7.

Similarly, the set B = {2,4,6,8,10} and set C=N={1,2,3,4,…} also contain their respective listed elements.

This listing method is used to represent sets in a clear and concise manner.

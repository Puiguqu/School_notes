Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

A set is a collection of unique objects, known as elements or members, that can be anything (numbers, letters, people, etc.). The definition of a set is based on the concept of an element, which is an object that belongs to the set. A set is defined using curly brackets {} containing the elements separated by commas. For example, {1, 2, 3} represents the set containing the numbers 1, 2, and 3. The cardinality of a set refers to the number of unique elements it contains. The listing method involves writing down all the elements of a set in a specific order, while the rule of inclusion allows us to add or remove elements from a set using logical operations (e.g., ∪ for union, ∩ for intersection). The powerset of a set is the set containing all possible subsets of the original set. For example, the powerset of {1, 2, 3} is {{}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}}. Set operations include union (∪), intersection (∩), difference (-), and complement ('). These operations can be performed using logical rules, such as the distributive property. The set builder method involves constructing a set from a rule or condition that defines its elements. For example, {x | x is an integer} represents the set of all integers. Subsets are sets whose elements are also elements of another set. The problem section for Exercises 2.1 on pp.76 asks students to attempt questions 1-27, 30-36, and 41-44. Solutions to these exercises can be found in the "Solutions to Odd-Numbered Exercises" section at the back of the book.

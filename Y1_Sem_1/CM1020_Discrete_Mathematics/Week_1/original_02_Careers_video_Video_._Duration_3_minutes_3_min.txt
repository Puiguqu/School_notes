I'm leading this session, focusing on your career development, so the career developer stage. Now, for some people, career development means climbing the ladder and moving towards greater responsibility. But for other people, it means specialization, still staying in the same sector or perhaps moving to a larger organization. Always worth looking at the different career development journeys and picking out what's pertinent to you. I'm now 58. I've been working for 35 years. I've had different career development. We go through, it isn't just one career development experience, we go through different career development phases. It's worth thinking about the qualities of your career development phase now. What we often find is it actually the experience of studying with the University of London and the things you learned through that and through your program is one of the things that prompts people to think about the next step. Sometimes, looking to think, am I worried that I haven't got the right experience or skills? Edwin's point about the worry of learning new skills. How can I apply the learning that I'm doing in my university under qualification? Do I understand how the sector works? Do I need a bit more of a network? Some of the things we're going to look at today is about how you can address some of those works. One of the things we should be starting with these little repetic exercises is I often observe and know in myself that if I've got the story right in my own head, then I can persuade other people. First of all, this often comes in Edwin's point about the impostor syndrome, which is we have to convince ourselves first. It's worth taking the time and saying, how can I get myself in that good ready mindset? We're going to start with somebody called Liedtka. Who looked at strategic thinking and gave it these three elements. Just to show what they mean. Basically, Liedtka said, good strategic thinkers. They take a system's perspective from which they mean look at the big picture, their intent focus. Keep the vision in front of you. I'm thinking of a strategic manager I know at the University of London, who said to me, keep your eye on the end prize. Actually, they do what's know as thinking in time. They look at past experiences, what's going on in the present, but they also, start doing future predictions and scenarios. They are hypothesis driven and they check out the evidence for what is going on here. Why might it be going on here? What does that tell us about what's likely to happen in the future? Also they intelligently opportunistically respond to changes. Now, this way of looking at it transfers very well to developing your career. It's worth rinsing it through these five steps. Looking at the big picture, looking at what jobs are being advertised, what they're looking for? Do you get a sense of is this a growing market or a declining market? When we're looking at the big picture of systems, we might be looking at the big picture of the labor market, or we might be looking at the big picture of what we want from our life, where we want to live, how available we want to be to our family, what money we want to earn, what lifestyle we want to be able to afford? What difference do we want to make in the world? ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 1.0 Introduction to the course Video: Video Introduction to discrete mathematics .

The concept of sets was introduced by George Cantor, a German mathematician. Set theory forms the basis of several other fields of studies, such as counting theory, relations, graph theory, and finite state machines. In this topic we will cover the basic elements of set theory. In this lesson, we will cover the following. What is a set, element of a set, a cardinality of a set, and a subset of a set? We now give a definition of a set. Mathematicians use, the term is set to refer to a collection of any kind of objects. The subjects might be people, ideas, or numbers, for example. A set is a well-defined collection of any kind of objects. The set of positive even numbers less than 10, we call this set the set E. The set of vowels in the English alphabet, and we call this set the set V. The set of colors, and we called a set the set C. The empty set is a set which contains nothing. In mathematics, we write the set of positive even numbers less than 10, E as E =. Then we open curly bracket when we list all the elements of this set which are 2, 4, 6, and 8, then we close curly bracket. Similarly, for the set of vowels in the English alphabet V, we write V =. When we open curly bracket one will list all the vowels in the English alphabet, which are a,e,i,o, and u. We refer to the empty set as curly brackets with nothing inside them, or we use this notation. A set is an unordered collections of unique objects. Because the order of elements in a set is not important, and no duplicates are allowed in sets, then the following three sets are all the same. In mathematics we use this notation to refer to element of a given set. And we use this notation to refer to elements not in a set. For example, consider the set E containing even positive integer less than 10. As you can see then number 2 is an element of the set E, we write 2 element of E. However, the number 3 is not an element of a set E, and we write 3 not in a set E. Similarly, for the set V the letter a is a vowel, so we write a is an element of V or a is in V. But the letter s is not a vowel, so we write s is not an element of V. We now define the cardinality of a set. The cardinality of a set S written as, S between straight brackets is just the number of elements in a set S. For example, the set E contains 4 elements. Hence, the cardinality of the set E = 4. However, the set V contains 5 elements. Hence, the cardinality of the set V = 5. The empty set contains no elements. Hence, the cardinality of the empty set = 0. A is a subset of B if and only if every element of A also an element of B. In which case we will write A subset of B. A is a subset of B is equivalent to, if x is an element of A, then x is also an element of B for all element x. For example, the set containing two element, 2 and 6 is a subset of the set E. However, the set containing the element 2 and 3 is not a subset of E as 3 is not an element of E. Similarly, the set containing a and i is a subset of set V. However, the set containing a and b is not a subset of V, as b is not an element of V. The empty set is a subset of any sets. We can see that the empty set is a subset of the set E. And we can write empty set is a subset of E. Similarly, here we can clearly see that the empty set is a subset of itself, and we write the empty set is a subset of the empty set. Any set is a subset of itself, as it satisfies the definition of what a subset is. For example, the set E containing the elements 2,4,6,8. We can clearly see the subset containing 2,4,6,8 = E. Therefore, we can see that E is a subset of E. We now look at some special sets. The set N is a set of natural numbers. The Z is a set of all integers, negative and positive integers. The set Q is a set of all rational numbers which are of the form a/b where a and b are element of Z, and b is different from 0. R is the set of all real numbers. We can clearly see that N is a subset of Z, and Z is a subset of Q, where Q is a subset of R. In this lesson, we looked up a definition of a set, element of a set, the cardinality of a set, and what do we mean with the subset of a set. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 1.0 Introduction to the course Lesson 1.1 Introduction to set theory Video: Video The definition of a set .

1 Introduction A set is a fundamental concept in mathematics and computer science. It’s a collection of distinct objects, considered as an object in its own right. Sets are used to group related items together and to perform operations on these groups. 2 Definition of a set Definition 1. A set is a collection of objects. The objects in a set are called its elements or members. The elements in a set can be any types of objects, including sets! The members of a set do not even have to be of the same type. For example, although it may not have any meaningful application, a set can consist of numbers and names. Definition 2. A set is an unordered collection of distinct elements. For example: The set of primary colours can be written as {red, blue, yellow} Elements of a set are also called members. 3 Notation Sets are usually denoted by capital letters, and their elements are listed within curly braces. For example the set A containing elements 1, 2, and 3 can be written as A={1,2,3} 3.1 Element or member of set ( ∈) The symbol ∈ denotes membership. If a is an element of a set A, we write a∈A For example: The set A={1,2,3} is a set containing the elements 1, 2 and 3. We write: 1∈A means 1 is an element of A, 2∈A means 2 is an element of A and, 3∈A means 3 is an element of A. We refer to not a member of a set using the symbol ∈ / . If a is not an element of a set A, we write a∈ / A. For example: let A be a set with A={1,2,3}. Clearly 4 is not an element of A. We write 4∈ / A. 3.2 Special sets of numbers We designate these notations for some special sets of numbers: N= the set of natural numbers (positive integers) Z= the set of integers Q=the set of rational numbers R= the set of real numbers 3.3 Empty set ( ∅) The empty set, also known as the null set, is a fundamental concept in set theory and mathematics. It is the set that contains no elements. Definition 3. The empty set is a set with no elements. It is denoted by ∅ or {}. In mathematical notation ∅={}. 3.4 Cardinality of a set The cardinality of a set refers to the number of elements in the set. It is a measure of the 'size' of the set. Definition 4. The cardinality of a set A is denoted by ∣A∣, is the number of distinct elements in A. For example: For the set A={1,2,3,4}, the cardinality ∣A∣=4. For the set B={a,b,c}, the cardinality ∣B∣=3. For the empty set, ∅, the cardinality ∣∅∣=0. 3.5 Finite and infinite sets Finite set: A set with a limited number of elements. Example: {2,4,6}. Infinite set: A set with an unlimited number of elements. Example: The set of natural numbers N={1,2,3,…}. 3.6 Exercise Using the set notation, list all the elements contained in each of the following sets: 1. A= the set of positive integers less than 8. 2. B= the set of even positive integers less or equal to 10. 3. C= the set of natural numbers. 3.7 Solution Using the set notation, list all the elements contained in each of the following sets: 1. A={1,2,3,4,5,6,7} . 2. B={2,4,6,8,10}. 3. C=N={1,2,3,4,⋯}. 4 Summary This way of representing sets is called the listing method. In future lessons we will look at more examples of this method as well other set representation methods, such as the the set builder notation method and how sets are represented using Venn diagram.

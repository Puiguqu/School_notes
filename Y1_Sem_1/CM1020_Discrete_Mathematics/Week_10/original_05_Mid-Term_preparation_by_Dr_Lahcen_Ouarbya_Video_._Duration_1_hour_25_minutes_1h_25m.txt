Sorry, it was a little bit messy, I couldn't use the iPad. My name is Lahcen Ouarbya, and I'm the module leader for discrete mathematics. Well, I'll go through the same questions that I went through last time. What we will look, we will have a question from a set, a question from functions, propositional logic, predicate logic, and probably Boolean algebra. Let's look at the first exercise. We looked at two different methods of representing sets. We looked at the method which is called the rules of inclusion or the method which called the listing method. The set A in this exercise is written in a method called the rules of inclusion. It's a general form, and this set A contains the numbers of the form 1 plus, minus 1 to the power of n, such that n is a positive integer. To do this exercise, we know that n can be 1,2,3 and so on, any positive integers. One second, let me get my iPad, and so if n is an odd number then minus 1 to the power of n will be equal to minus 1. Therefore, 1 plus, minus 1 to the power of n will be equal 1 minus 1, which will be zero. Zero is an element of this set. If n is an even number, then minus 1 to the power of n will be equal to 1, and 1 plus minus 1 to the power of n will be just 1 plus 1, which will be 2. Therefore, this set A contains two elements only zero and two. That's the answer to this exercise. The answer will be of the set A is just the set containing two elements, which are zero and one. Now, let's look at the other way around. We've got a set A and the listing method and we want rewrite this set using the rules of inclusion. If we look at this set, it's on the form, so the set has got A, has got 1, 1/3, 1/5, 1/9, 1/7, 1/9 and A should be 1/11 that's a mistake there. What we look at all those numbers have some things in common. What do they have? We can write this one as 1/2 times 0 plus 1. We can write this as 1/2 times 1 plus 1. We can write this 1/5 as 1/2 times 2 plus 1, and so on until we get to 1/11, which is 1/2 times 5 plus the 1. We can see the general form for this numbers, they're all of the form 2 times n plus 1/2 times n plus 1, such that n starts from zero and ends in five. We can write the A, is the set of numbers, 1/2 times n plus 1, they're all odd numbers such that n is an element of Z and n is between 0 and 5. That's the general way of our presenting this set. Let's now switch back here. As you can see, A is the set of number of the form 1/2 n plus 1 such that n is an element of z or n and n is between 0 and 5 with 0 and 5 included. Or you can see between minus 1 and 6 with minus 1 and 6 not included. Or you can even write it as one of the 2 times 1/2 times n minus 1, where n is an element of N, we should set of natural numbers, which starts from 1, 2, 3 and so on and n is less than six, which means the n stops at five. That's the first exercise of how to convert from one way of representing a set to another way of representing a set. Now let's look at another exercise and sets. We've got a group of 100 people, 73 of these people can speak English, and 43 people can speak Spanish. We want to now how many of those can speak both English and Spanish. Also, how many of those 100 people can speak English only and how many of those people can speak Spanish only. We want to draw a Venn diagram to represent this information. That's what we will be doing, let me just switch back to my math. That's what I'll be doing in this exercise. We know that let's call A is the set of people speaking English only. A is a set of people who speak English, not English only about English. Let's call B, the set of people who speak Spanish. We know that the cardinality of A, which is the number of people who speak Spanish is 73, is given to us and we know that the cardinality of B, which is the number of people who speaks Spanish is given to us as 43. Now we need to know the number of people who speak both Spanish and English, and a number of people who speak English only and the number of people who speak Spanish only. We also know that the cardinality of the union of A and B is 100 because this survey is taking 100 people. The set of people who speaks English and Spanish will be set of A intersection B, which is the number of people who speaks is just the cardinality of A intersection B. As you know, the cardinality of A intersection B is the cardinality of A plus the cardinality of B minus the cardinality of A union B. That way, the number of people who speak both Spanish English will be 73 plus 43 minus the 100 and that will give us 16. , we need to work out the set of people who speaks English only. To do that, we need to do the cardinality of A minus B and the cardinality of A minus B is just the cardinality of A takeaway, anything that they're having comma minus the cardinality of A intersection B. That will give us 73 minus 16, which will give us 57. Now the same way we can work out the number of people who speak Spanish only. That would be just the cardinality of B minus A, which will be the cardinality of B minus the cardinality of the intersection of A and B. That will be 43 minus 16, which will give us 27. Now we have all this information in front of us. All what we need now is to work out the Venn diagram to represent this information. Venn diagram, we've got two sets. We've got set A and we've got set B. We know that we have 16 speaks both English and Spanish. We know that the number of people who speaks both languages is 16. We've already worked out this information. We know that the number of people who speaks English is 73. All what you have to do here, the number of people who speaks English only is 73 minus 16. If you take that way, 13 minus 6, that will give you 7 and 6 minus 1 that will be 5. It will be 57 in here. Yeah, 57 speaks English only. In a similar way, we can do the number of people who speak Spanish only, which will be 43 takeaway the 16, which would be 7 then 27 and that here would give us 27, speaks English only. If we add all that information together, we will find that it adds to 100 that we have none of them, which speaks none of the language. There is none who speaks none of the language. That is the information using Venn diagram. We've got 57 people speak English only and we've got 27, which speaks Spanish only. We've got 16 of them speaks both languages. If you add that information together, that should give you 100, 57, 27, and 16. If we add 57, 27, and 16, what do we get? We get 14, we get 20, and we go 8, which will give us 100. There is none of them who doesn't speak any of those two languages. Therefore, all the information, this is how to work out using those rules that we've already looked at and you can represent it using Venn diagram or you can also extract the information from Venn diagram. I think that will end these. You can see in the next slide all these information, the answer to this question is given in here. Now we will look at another exercise. What we have here is we have got two sets, A and B. We want to determine or to show which one of the following statement is true or false. The first statement that we want to look at is the power set. This is the power set of A union B, is this equal to the power set of A union the power set of B. We want to show if this is true or false. If it's true we'll show it, if it's not true we just come up with a counterexample. In this case, it's false. Let's find a counterexample to show that this statement is false. Let's say A has got a set containing one only, and B has got a set containing two only. A union B then will have a set containing one and two. Let's look at the power set of A. The power set of A will have the set containing the empty set and the set containing one. That's the power set of A. The power set of B will be set containing the empty set and two on its own. The power set of A union B is equal the set containing the empty set, containing one, set containing two, and the set containing one and two. As you can see, a power set of A union, the union of power set of B is just the empty set containing one, containing two. A can see that it's different from this. As a power set of A union B has this extra element. This ends this proof here. Just find a counterexample. If you think the statement is false, come up with a counterexample that shows that. The next question that we want to look at is the intersection power set of A intersection B, is it a subset of the power set of A intersection the power set of B? We want to show this proof. To show this, you start from an element. Let Sx be an element of a power set of A intersection B. Take an element. We need to show that x is also an element of a power set of A intersection power set of B. That's what we need to show. We need to start from here, that's our hypothesis, and we need to get to this conclusion. If you get to that, then the answer is true. What does it mean that x is an element of a power set of intersection of A and B? It means that x is a subset of A intersection B. x is a subset of A intersection B. That means that x is a subset of A and x is a subset of B. x is a subset of A. That leads to us that x is an element of a power set of A and x is a subset of B. That means that x is an element of a power set of B. If x is an element of a power set of A and x is an element of a power set of B, then this leads to x is also an element of a power set of A intersection power set of B. Hence, the statement power set of A intersection B subset of power set of A intersection power set of B is true. This ends the proof. Now I would move to a new topic, which is another topic which is functions. With functions, we've looked up the domain of the function, the codomain of the function. What is a function? Is a function one-to-one and onto the z inverse function exist? Is the function invertible? That's all the things that we looked in this topic. I have here three function. A function F1 is defined from R to R with f1 of x, should be f1 of x not f of x. F1 of x is 1 over 1 minus x squared. F2 is defined from Z to Z with f2 of x is x over 2 and f3 of x is defined from R to R with f of x, is equal to a logarithm of x. The first one would say which one of this function with the following relations is actually a function. To be a function, every element in the domain has to have an image. If there exists one element which has no image then it is not a function. Let's start with the first one. The first one, f1 of x. F1 is defined from R to R with f1 of x is equal to 1 over 1 minus x squared. As you can see here, minus 1 and 1 are elements of R. There are elements of the domain. However, f1 of minus 1 and f1 of one don't exists. Yeah. There are two inputs which have no image. This is not a function. Yeah, it's not a function. F1 is not a function. The reason for it is minus one and one, which are element of the codomain. However, they don't have an image. If we remove minus one and one from the domain, then it becomes a function. Let's look at the second function. The second function, f2. F2 is defined from Z to Z, takes on integer as an input, and it gives you an integer as an output. With f2 of x is equal x over 2. You take an integer, is this a function or not a function? Yeah. If we take, for example, let's say three, three is an element of the domain of Z. However, f2 of 3 is equal 3 over 2 and this element is not in codomain. All odd numbers don't have an image. Yeah, you can take 1, 5. They all gives you a fraction which is not an integer. Our codomain contains integers only, that for all the even numbers have an image, but odd numbers have no image. Therefore, this is not a function. It's not a function. Let's go back to this one. If I changed that to R or even to just set of rational numbers key, then it will become a function. If I change the co-domain, I've changes to R or Q then it become a function. We might look at function, but please look at the domain and the co-domain and see if that is correct. Also, if I take the domain is just even integers, then it will be a function. Because the only thing that makes it not a function here is the odd numbers. They don't have an image. Let's look at the third one. The function f_3 of x is defined from R to R with f of x is equal to natural logarithm of x. We know that the logarithm function does not exist for a negative numbers and zero. If you remember the logarithm function, it's something that comes like this. N1 here, logarithm of one is equal to zero. However and this gets closer to the y-axis, but it never touch it. The logarithm of zero does not exist. The logarithm of all negative number does not exist so it's not a function. Again, if there exists one input which has no image then these relation is not a function. If we change the domain to be R plus, which is only positive real numbers, then it becomes a function. The logarithm function is defined from R plus to R. That ends this first exercise. Well, let's now take you to another exercise, which is to look at the properties of functions. When a relation is a function, then we can now talk about its domain, co-domain, range, all those kind of things that were talked about, and we can also talk about some properties. Is it an injection? Is it a surjection? Is it bijection? Does it have the inverse function? We use the term one-to-one which is the injective, onto which is surjective, and if it's both one-to-one and onto, it's a bijection and you will be able to find the inverse function. If the function is a bijection, then it has an inverse function and we can work that out. First, we want to have those functions, and we will now look if those functions are one-to-one, onto or both or none of them. Let's have a look at the first one. The first function is f_x of x. F_1 is defined from R to R with f of x. X has got image f of x, which is plus 3. This is a linear function and the domain is R and its co-domain is R. You've already seen that this function in a few videos that it's one-to-one and onto and it's also bijection. To prove that it's one-to-one, we start for one-to-one we start let A. Let a and b be elements of the domain, which is R. You can start by the assumption f of a, we assume that f of a is equal to f of b and we need to show that a must be equal to b. If we show that, then the function is one-to-one. You can also show that if a is different from b, then f of a is also different from f of b. Let's do that. This is our starting point, f of a is equal to f of b. What does that mean? Means 2a plus 3 is equal to 2b plus 3. If we remove the three, we cancel three, will cancel each other, the 2 will cancel each other, and we'll have that a is equal to b. Starting from f of a is equal to f of b as our hypothesis and we go to a conclusion that if this is true, then a must be equal to b, they can't be different. Now, we've just shown that the function is a one-to-one function. Now let's show if this function is an onto function. What does an onto function means? Onto function means every element in the codomain has at least one pre-image. We have f of x is equal to plus 3 and the domain is R to R. Yes, this is our codomain and this is our domain of f. They're both equal to R. What we need to say, we need to find, if you take, let y be an element of your codomain, what is the codomain of f, which is this R. We need to show that there exists, that's the notation we use for there exists, we need to show that there exists x element of the domain of f, which is also R, such that f of x is equal to y. That's what we need to show. Some will start, let's say if we can find this x now, we'll start by f of x is equal to y, which means plus 3 is equal to y. Which means that is equal to y minus 3, which means that x is equal to y minus 3 over 2. If we take any element y in codomain, we can find x, which is just equal to y minus 3 over 2 as its pre-image. If y is in R, y minus 3 over 2 is also an element of R, which is our domain. We've just shown that if you take any element y of your codomain, then you can find at least one pre-image or one pre-image in this case, is y minus 3 over 2. Therefore, this function now is an onto function. Or we also use surjective, it's a surjective function. The function f1 is both one-to-one and onto. Now what you need to do is watch what I've done in the next one, I've only changed the domain and the codomain, so it's the same function. F_2 is defined not from R-R as I did before, but from Z-Z. With f_2 of x is equal to plus 3, is exactly the same thing, but all I have changed is the domain and the codomain. This function for the same reason that we did before, is a one-to-one function. However, it's not an onto function now. Let's say if I take 4, which is an element of my co-domain, can I find x in the domain such that f of x is equal to 4. Let's look at the f of x is equal to 4. That means that plus 3 is equal to 4. That means that is equal to 4 minus 3. That means that is equal to 1. That means that x is equal to 1/2. If this pre-image exists, that it must be equal to 1/2, however, our domain does not have 1/2. The domain contains only the set of integers. This function now is not an onto function or you could say not a surjective function. You have to be careful when you look at this. You have to take the domain and the codomain into account. You can't just look at the functions, this is a linear function. Yeah, it's a one-to-one or an onto functions. That's why I had given this example to show that the domain and the codomain play a big role in deciding the property of one-to-one and onto function. Now, let's look at this function f_3 is defined from R to R with f_3 of x is just the floor of x. If you forgot what the floor function is, so if you've got an integer n and an integer n plus 1 here then the floor of any elements in between, not including n minus 1 will be n. If you take x in here, the floor of x will be just n. For example, if I have 3 here, 4 here, if I take the floor of 3.4, that will be 3. If I take the floor of 3.999 it still will be 3. The floor of an integer, the floor of 3 is 3. The floor of an integer is itself. That is what the floor function is. Let's now look at this function and decide if it is one-to-one and onto or not. The floor, it is a function because each element has got an image. Let's now look to see if it's one-to-one. We just come up with a counterexample. The floor of, let's say of 1 is equal the floor of 1.5 is equal to 1. One is different from 1.5. However, f_3 of 1 is equal to f_3 of 1.5. This function is not one-to-one function. That answers. The answer is not just come up with a counterexample that shows that it is. Now again, let's look if this function is an onto function. If we look at this function, I'm going to write it again f_3 is defined from R to R with f_3 of x is equal to floor of x. We know that the floor is always an integer, however, our domain contains numbers which are not integers. For example, 1.5 here. If I take 1.5 in my domain and my co-domain, I can't find any element x in my domain such that the floor of x is equal to 1.5. It's only integers that can have pre-domain. Anything that is not integers in here has no pre-image. Therefore, it's not an onto function. It's suffice is to find one element, which has no pre-image to say that the function is not an onto function. If I go to another function, f4, and is defined from Z to Z with x has got f4 of x, which is just exactly the floor function. All I have changed here is my domain Z to Z. Now this function is one-to-one and onto; every element, the floor of an integer is itself. This is like the identity function really and the domain is equal to the co-domain. This function is one-to-one for the same reason that it was previously and also is an onto function because if you look at all I removed I removed the element that made that function not onto before. I left only integers because every integer has at least itself in the co-domain as it's pre-image. I hope this is clear now so when you look at those properties, you need to take the domain and the co-domain into account. Now I'll just switch back. In this slide here you can see the first function is one-to-one and onto all, second function is one-to-one, but it's not onto, and the third function is neither one-to-one nor onto. It's a function which is neither one-to-one nor onto. The third function here I did from Z-Z. But if I changed the domain here to be R, then it will be not one-to-one because you can see if the domain is R, the floor of one is same as the floor of 1.99, so it's not one-to-one it's actually many to one. But it would still be onto because my domain has got only set of integers, which they all have a pre-image. That will end this exercise. Now I'll go to another topic that we've looked at and it's propositional logic. Let's look at this very small exercise on propositional logic. We've got two propositions, p and q. We assume that p implies q is false. Now we want to work out the truth value of the following statements: p and p, not p or q, q implies p, not q implies not p. But we start from p implies q is false, so let's look at that. We've got two proposition and we start from p implies q is equal to false. P implies q is false, what does that mean? That means that p is true and q is false. That's the only situation that can make p implies q is false. p implies q false means p is true, but q is false. Starting from p implies q is false, this will lead us to this, that p is true and q is false. Now what does p implies q? Now let's look p and q, p and q, which means true and false, this will be false. The second one, which is naught p or q. What does that naught p or q? If p is true, then naught p is false, that will be false or q, which is false, that will give us false. The third one, which is q, implies p. What is q implies p, q is false, which is false implies true, which will always give us true. False implies anything is always true. The only case where the amplification is false and when the first one is true, but the second is false. The last one is naught q implies naught p. What is naught q, naught q will be true because q is false. Naught q is true. Because p is true, naught will be false. Again, this will be true implies false, which will give us false. If you look at this as the contrapositive of p implies q. The contrapositive is just keep the same meaning, but is the negation. We know that p implies q is equivalent to its contrapositive and which is naught q implies naught p. We can show this, p implies q is false also naught q implies naught p is also false. Because those two statements say the same thing or have the same meaning or they are equivalent. That's all the answers to the next slide. Now, we look at another exercise or logic, which is on propositional logic, which is adjust to rewrite some statements from English written in words to using the logical symbolic expression. We've got three proposition here. We've got P, which the meaning of p, I finished writing my computer program before lunch. That's the meaning of p, that's what p means. q, I play football in the afternoon and r the sun is shining. That's the meaning of those three propositions. We want to rewrite the following statements using logic expression, using a symbolic expression using p, q, and r. The first statement which is if the sun is shining and I put this in capital letter, I finish writing my computer program, I shall play football then I shall play football in the afternoon. I shall play football this afternoon. Let's look at this. That is an f. Sun shining, which is r a proposition r and I finish writing my computer program. What does that mean, which is p? I shall play football, and this will give us proposition key. What this will give us is p and r. I finished writing my program is p, This is p and this is q, so it's p and r. This will leads to q, so it's p and r implies q. That's what it means using p on our notation. Then we look up the next one. The next one, what does it say? The next says I will play football this afternoon only if I highlight this, only if the sun is shining, and I finish writing my computer program. Let's look at this. I will play football this afternoon, that's q, that's the proposition q. The sun, sorry, this is and here, so the sun is shining his art, and I finish writing my computer program is the proposition p. Remember when there is only if it change the direction of the implication. Here means I will play football only if those two happens, which is r and p, so that means that if q is 2 that implies p and r, so q implies p and r not p and r implies q. If you are confused or remove only if, leave the if there. If remove this only, then find the expression then invert the direction of the amplification. If you are. For example if I have p, only, if q that means p implies q. If q, then p, that means q implies p. Now when you do only if that changed your direction, that ends this exercise, and now I'll go to something that we've done before. But I'll mix it up with proposition, with predicate logic, and what we've done in existential and all those quantifiers that we've looked at. If I look at this exercise, we have this we looked at the quantifiers that we've looked at it predicate logic with a for all x universal existential which is the exists, so let's look at those, so p of x are two logical functions, and we have this statements. We have this statement which is for all x if p of x then q of x. We want to write the contrapositive of this statement or the converse of this statement, or the inverse of this function. The inverse of the contrapositive of P implies Q; P of x then Q of x is just P of x includes P of x implies Q of x. The contrapositive has used the negation by keeping the same meaning. It just changed the order of P and Q and include the negation. The contrapositive will be, if naught Q of x then naught P of x. The converse has just changed the order so P implies Q it's converse is Q implies P. Which is for all x element of D here, which is the domain of discourse here. If Q of x, then P of x, That's the combat. The inverse just gave P and K all you need to do just add the negation P and Q in that position and add the negation to them. It would be for all x element of D, if naught P of x, then naught Q of x. That's the inverse and the converse and the contrapositive of a statement of this form. Now, let's look at this example here. We're in predicate logic. We have got f of x is 0. Sorry my iPad adjust. :06 Just to get you in my iPad back it went to the. :16 Let's look at this statement what we have here is this statement which is for all x element of R. Domain of discourses are, if the absolute value of x is greater than 3, then x square is greater than 9. :00 We need to find the contrapositive of the inverse and the converse of this function. To do that, let's P of x means the absolute value of x is greater than 3 and called Q of x. X squared is greater than 9. We can use exactly the same thing. Then our statement becomes for all x element of R, if P of x, then Q of x, then we just choose what we've used before. What is the convex? The convex will be, sorry, the contrast start with the contrapositive so contrapositive will be for all x. If naught Q of x, :15 then naught P of x. What does that mean? What is naught Q of x? For all x, if Q means x squared is greater than 9 than naught Q will be if x squared is less or equal to 9. :43 Then x, less than or equal to 9, then naught P of x, why is naught P of x. Absolute value of x is less than or equal to 3 and that's the convex. This statement and this statement to say the same tip, so not the converse pardon me is the contrapositive is naught of the Q implies naught of P is the same thing as P implies Q. That's the contrapositive. If we wanted to look at the next one is the converse. What is the converse? :31 The converse will be :36 naught that's the contrapositive will be just q of x implies p of x. It wouldn't be for all x if q of x, then p of x. Which means for all x element of R, if x squared is greater than 9, then absolute value of x is greater than 3. That is the converse. Then next one will be the inverse. The inverse is, again, it's just, the inverse of p implies q, it just naught p of x implies naught q of x. That's the inverse. What does it mean for all x, what's naught p? If the absolute value of x is less or equal to 3, then x squared is less or equal to 9. That is the inverse of this statements. :17 Then we looked again, I'll have to use the quantifiers to write those statements. It's another exercise on predicate logic. Let a be the set of all students. Let p of x be the proposition that x plays football. A is the set of all students, p of x means x plays football, :53 s of x is the set of all students in the same class, stays from the same class. :03 In this s of x is the set of all students that are in the same class as the student x, x is a student. Let's use the rules of inference with quantifiers to formalize the following. Let me change this to here. We have A set of all students, s of s set of students in the same class as x. In the same class as x, x is a student, s of x is all the set of all students in the same class. Now we want to formalize this. :26 None of the students play football. The first statement is none of the students plays football. :49 What does none of the students plays football. It means for all x element of A is a students. :06 We have naught p of x, because p of x is played football. Let's make it like p of x is play football means x plays football. :29 S of x is just the set of all students. For all x, not P of x. :41 The next sentence that was given is not every students :58 play football. :06 Not every student play football. What does that mean? There exists some students who don't play football. It means we can write it there exist x element of A, such that not be effects, they don't play football remove that colon. There exists x element of A such that not P of x, means they don't play football. The last sentence is, :56 there exists a student's whose none of his classmates play football. :09 Try to write this. There exists a student who's none of his or her classmates may play football. :46 That's what I told, because my writing is not that great. :58 What does that mean? That exist one students such that all their classmates don't play football. What does that mean? We can say there exists x element of A, set of all students. :21 Such that for all y element of S of x, or S of x is the set of all the classmate of x. We have not P of y. They don't play football. There exist one student such that all his classmates don't play football. His or that classmate don't play football. It's just an exercise to take like a statement in words and we'II write it using the rule of inference and quantifiers that looked at. Again, we've looked at before or how to find the negation of a statement. If we have a statement and you'll want to work out the negation of. Let's look at one exists size here is the exercise 4 on predicate logic. Let's P of x and Qy be two Boolean function, your Q of x. We need to find the negation of the following. :02 I think, :21 one second please. :27 Let me rewrite this statement in. I'll use my iPad to explain. We've got p of x. :46 Other one is p of y or people can call it q of y, or we can call it q of x as well. We need to find the negation of the following statement. The first statement is for all x, :10 there exists y such that p of x and q of y. :24 That's our p of x and q of y. We need to find a negation for this statement. How do you find a negation? To find a negation, you change this to exists. You change exists to fall. You change p of x to not p of x. You change the answer to all and you change q of y to not q of y. :09 They become its negation that exists x, such that for all y, not p of x or not q of y. I'll do one more statement on this sorts then I can move on. statement is :48 for all x and for all y, we've got p of x or q of y. :02 We want to find its negation in a similar way, we can do that, replace this by there exists this, there exists p of x, which will be not p of x. Or will be an end? Y will be not q of y? The statement will be, there exists x, and there exists y, such that not p of x and not q of y. :50 We'll do another one. I won't do all of them, I'll do another one that has the implication. If I have a statement, there exists x and there exists y, such that p of x implies q of y. :13 Its negation, again in a similar way, this will be for all x, this will be for all y. :26 What's the negation of this, p of x? This will be p of x implies not q of y. That's its negation. You got to be very careful when you have the implication on how to do the negation. It's very easy. You change that exists for all. You change for all, you change the and to all, the all to and if there is any statement, but be careful when there is the application. :21 The last exercise that I want to do with you is this one. Let p of x and y be a Boolean function. We assume that there exists x such that for all y, p of x, y is true. :51 Assuming that this is true, we want to prove that the following are true or false. We don't know. But we'll start from the assumption that there exists x for all y, p of x, y is true. That's our starting point, or that's our hypothesis. We try to show if those three statements are either true or false. I've got the answers already that in the slides which I'll just go through them. If you look, there exists for all, if you look at this statement here, is the negation of this statement. If this statement is true, then this must be false because it's negation. If you look, exists for all, for fall exists p of x not p of x, y. That is then the third statement is false and it is just the negation of a statement that we assumed is true whose our starting point that the first statement is true. Now let's move to the next one. :25 Our assumption is this, there exists x and for all y P of x, y is true. That means the first one we just show that it's negation, then they must be false. Now we want to prove this one is false as well. We can give, what does P of x, y means? Because to show this, we need to show it for any Boolean or any Boolean function p of x y. We can say that let's P of x, y means x is less or equal to y. You can see that there exists an x which is 1, and one if our domain is n, x and y are a natural numbers, then the smallest natural numbers is one. Therefore, one is less or equal to any natural number. We have this statement there exists x, which is one for all other natural numbers. Why? We know that p of x is true as one is less or equal to all other natural numbers. However, taking this our P x, y is one less than or equal to y. For all x and for all y P of x, y is false. We can take x is two and take y as one. Then two is not less or equal to 1, then the statement is false. :26 The other statement, there exists x and there exists y, such that P of x is true. There exists x there exists y P of x. We know that there exists x for all y, P of x is true, for all y. If that is true, then we take just one of those y's. There exists x and there exists y P of x is true. If this is two, there exists x for all y P of x, then there exists x. There exists y P of x must also be true. That's all I want to talk about today. Maybe in next lecture, I might do some more videos about predicate logic as you suggested last time. That's the topic you are struggling with. I'll try to record something on predicate logic and post it on Coursera. Anyway, thank you, and I'll see you again on the next video, and good luck.

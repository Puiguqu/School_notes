Discrete Mathematics midterm exam key concepts review 1. Set theory - Sets are collections of distinct objects, denoted as elements. The universal set is a standard set that contains all objects or elements under consideration for a particular discussion. - Key operations on sets include intersection (finding common elements), union (combining all unique elements), and difference (subtracting one set from another). - Venn Diagrams are tool used to visually display the relationship among sets and their elements. - Power sets are the collection of all subsets that can be formed from a given set, including the set itself and the empty set. Skills required: Ability to identify and classify sets, manipulate sets using the operations of intersection, union, and difference, represent sets visually through Venn diagrams, and form power sets. 2. Functions - Functions are rules that assign to each input exactly one output. They can be injections (one-to-one), surjections (onto), or bijections (both). - Composition of functions involves applying one function to the result of another, creating a composite function. - The inverse of a function 'reverses' the action of the original function. Skills required: Ability to determine types of functions, perform composition of functions, and compute inverse of functions. 3. Logarithms - Logarithms represent the power to which a specified base number must be raised to obtain a specific number. - Understanding and solving equations dealing with logarithmic expressions is a crucial skill in mathematics. Skills required: Proficiency in calculating and interpreting the results of logarithmic expressions, particularly in the context of solving equations. 4. Propositional logic - Propositional logic deals with propositions (which are simply statements that are either true or false) and argument forms (logical structures involving propositions). - An understanding of truth tables, tautologies, contrapositives, inverses, and converses is essential. Skills required: Ability to construct and interpret truth tables, understand and define tautologies, contrapositives, inversions, and converses. 5. Logical argument - Logical reasoning involves forming conclusions based on a set of premises. - The validity of an argument depends on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises. Skills required: Ability to interpret and create valid logical arguments, make correct inferences based on premises. 6. Predicates - Predicates and quantifiers are used to build logical expressions that make more complex assertions about the objects in a domain. Skills required: Understanding and applying the concepts of predicate logic, ability to use quantifiers to construct logical expressions. 7. Boolean algebra - Boolean algebra deals with variables that take only two values, and the operations on these variables are AND, OR, and NOT. - Logic circuits, De Morgan's laws, Karnaugh maps, and sum of products are integral parts of Boolean algebra. Skills required: Ability to apply Boolean algebra operations, read and design logic circuits, apply De Morgan's laws, construct and interpret Karnaugh maps, simplify Boolean expressions to minimal form.

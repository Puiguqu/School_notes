Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key In this lecture, we will introduce another form of mathematical induction called strong induction. We will begin by introducing the formal expression of strong induction and look at some examples of how it works. Then, we will present the well-ordering property and show how it can be used in proofs. Finally, we will conclude by showing how mathematical induction, strong induction, and well-ordering can be used equivalently in building proofs. Sometimes, it's easier to prove statements using a different form of mathematical induction called strong induction. Strong induction can be formalized using the following rule of inference. P of 1 is true, and for all k in N, P of 1, P of 2, and so on until P of k are true, implies P of k+1 is true. Therefore, for all n in N, P of n is true. Strong induction is sometimes called the second principle of mathematical induction or complete induction. Let's start by proving a simple statement, expressed as the propositional function P of n for all n in N, where n is greater or equal to 2, n is divisible by a prime number. To prove it, we need to verify two steps. First, the basis step. P of 2 reduces to two, which is divisible by a prime number because two is a prime number and divides itself. Now, we move on to the inductive step. Let k in N greater than 2. If the inductive hypothesis is P of k is true, let's also assume P of 2 and so on until P of k+1 is true. Then, for all m in N, where m is between 2 and k+1, there exists P, a prime number dividing m. Then, for all m in N where m is between 2 and k+1, there exists P, a prime number, dividing m. We have two cases, k+2 is a prime number, in which case it is trivially divisible by itself, k+2 is not a prime number, in which case there exists m dividing k+2. As m is between 2 and k+1, there exists P, a prime number dividing m, and P also divides k+2 which verifies P of k+2 is true and it proves the strong induction. The well-ordering property is an axiom about N that we assume to be true. The axioms about N are the following. The number 1 is a positive integer. If n belongs to N, then n+1, the successor of n, is also a positive integer. Every positive integer other than one is the successor of a positive integer. The well-ordering property where every nonempty subsets of the set of positive integers has at least one element. The well-ordering property can be used as a tool in building proofs. Now, let's reconsider the statement that we proved earlier, P of n, for all n in N where n is greater or equal to 2, n is divisible by a prime number. Now, let's try to prove this statement using the well-ordering property. Let S be the set of positive integers greater than one with no prime divisor. Suppose S is nonempty, let n be its smallest element, n cannot be prime since n divides itself and if n were prime, it would be its own prime divisor. So n is composite, it must have a divisor d with d between one and n. Then, d must have a prime divisor by the minimality of n, let's call it p. Then, p divides d and d divides n. So p divides n, which is a contradiction. Therefore, S is empty, which verifies P of n. We can prove the following statements. Mathematical induction implies the well-ordering property, the well-ordering property implies strong induction, strong induction implies mathematical induction. That is, the principles of mathematical induction, strong induction, and well-ordering are all equivalent. In other words, the validity of each of these three proof techniques implies the validity of the other two techniques. In this lesson, we introduced another form of mathematical induction called strong induction. We began by introducing the formal expression of strong induction and looked at some examples of how it works. Then, we examined the well-ordering property and demonstrated how it can be used in proofs. Finally, we showed how mathematical induction, strong induction, and well-ordering can be used equivalently in building proofs. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Video: Video Introduction to proofs .

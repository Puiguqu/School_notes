Read the following extracts from the Koshy textbook. These pages cover the following topics: the definition of recursion; recursively defined functions; recursively defined sets; and recursively defined algorithms and examples. Koshy, pp.104–06, pp.261–66 and pp.278–82 . Once you’ve finished the reading, attempt the following exercises from Koshy (2004): p.283, exercises 1–6. Several exercises have solutions at the back of the book under the section ‘Solutions to odd-numbered exercises’. Please consult this section to check the answer to your exercises. If you got the answer wrong, revisit the question and see how you can arrive at the right answer. Lesson 6.2 Recursion Video: Video Recursive definitions .

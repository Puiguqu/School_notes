First we will define what the degree of a vertex is. Then we will define the degree sequence of a graph. At the end we will explore some properties of the degree sequence of graphs, and then we will examine how they apply to some examples. The degree of a vertex of a graph is the number of edges incident to the vertex. A loop contributes twice to the degree an isolated vertex has a degree 0. A way to count the degree of a vertex is to draw a circle around the vertex and count the number of edges that crosses the circle. For instance, if we consider the following graph, the vertex v1 has a degree 4, the degrees of the other vertices are 2 for v2, 4 for v3, 3 for v4, 1 for v5, and 0 for v6. In the case of directed graphs, we distinguish between n degree of a vertex v defining the number of edges for which v is the terminal vertex. Out-degree of the vertex v defining the number of edges for which v is the initial vertex. And the degree is the sum of out of the degree of v and in-degree of v a loop contributes twice to the degree as it contributes 1 to both in-degree and out-degree. Well, let's look at the following directed graph. The in-degree of v1 is equal to 2 and the out-degree of v1 is equal to 2. Then the degree of v1 which is the in-degree of v1 plus the out-degree of v1 which is equal to 2 plus 2, which is equal to 4. The in-degree of v2 is equal to 1 and the out-degree of v2 is equal to 1. Therefore, the degree of v2 is just 1 plus 1 which is equal to 2. The in-degree of v3 is equal to 2 and the out-degree of v2 is equal to 2. Therefore, the degree of v3 is equal to 2 plus 2, which is 4. The in-degree of v4 is equal to 1 and the out-degree of v4 is equal to 2. Therefore, the degree of v4 is 1 plus 2 which is 3. The in-degree of v5 which is 1 and the out-degree of v5 is 0. Therefore, the degree of v5 is just 1 plus 0, which is 1. For v6, the in-degree of v6 is 0 and the out-degree of v6 is 0. Therefore, the degree of v6 is just 0. Now that we have defined the degree of a vertex, let's define what a degree sequence of a graph is. Given an undirected graph G, the degree sequence of a graph is a sequence of the degree of each vertex in g written in a descending order separated by commas. Now, let's take a look at the following graph. The degree of v1 is 4, the degree of v2 is 2, the degree of v3 is 3, the degree of v4 is 2, whereas the degree of v5 is 1. Therefore, the degree sequence of this graph is 4,3,2,2,1. Let's have a look at some properties of a graph's degree sequence. The sum of the degree sequence of a graph is always even. In other words, it is impossible to construct a graph where the sum of the degree sequence is odd. For instance, let G be the following graph. The degree sequence of G is 4,3,3,2,1,1, and the sum of the degree sequence is equal to 1+1+2+3+3+4, which is 14, which is an even number. Let's take a look at another property of the degree sequence of a graph. Given a graph G, the sum of the degree sequence of G is twice the number of edges in G. In other words, the number of edges is equal to half the sum of the degree sequence. Now, let's have a look at the following graph. The degree sequence of this graph is 4,3,3,2,1,1 and the sum of the degree sequence of this graph is 4 plus 3 plus 3 plus 2 plus 1 plus 1, which is 14. Therefore, the number of edges in this graph is 14 divided by 2, which is 7. And if we go to the graph and count the number of edges, we should find 7 with 1,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 edges. Here is another example of a graph with 3 vertices. The degree of each vertex here is 2. This vertex has a degree 2, this vertex has a degree 2 and this vertex has a degree 2. Therefore, the degree sequence of this graph is 2,2, 2. And the sum of the degree sequence will be 2+2+2 which is 6. Therefore, the number of edges in this graph is 6 divided by 2, which is 3. And if we count the number of edges in this graph, we should find 3,1,2,3. As we have seen, a graph can be represented by its degree sequence. Let's now practice those properties in the form of an exercise. Which of the following degree sequences is it possible to construct a graph with? If you believe a graph can be constructed, then find the number of edges in the graph. Now, pause the video and have a go. Now, let's look at the first degree sequence, 3,2,2,1. The sum of the degree sequence is 1+2+2+3, which is 8. So the sum is even hence, we can construct a graph with this degree sequence and the number of edges in this graph is just 8 divided by 2, which is 4. For the second degree sequence 3,3,2,1, the sum of the degree sequence is 1+2+3+3, which is 9. This is an odd number. Therefore, it is impossible to construct a graph with this degree sequence. In todays lecture, we explained the concept of the degree sequence of a graph. We first defined what it is meant by the degree of a vertex. Then we defined the degree sequence of a graph. We also explored some properties of the degree sequence of a graph. At the end, we showed how these properties hold using some example graphs. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Video: Video Topic 7 introduction .

Here are 15 sentences summarizing the text, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

1. The next exercise will teach users more about Dijkstra's algorithm and its application to real-world scenarios.
2. Users will be responsible for running Dijkstra's algorithm step-by-step to find the shortest route between two stations in an underground network.
3. Dijkstra's algorithm can be executed on weighted graphs, where each vertex represents a station, each edge represents a route, and the distance between two stations represents the cost or weight of that route.
4. The simulation consists of a weighted graph representing the London underground network, with weights representing real distances in kilometers.
5. Users will be prompted to select a starting and ending point for their journey on the graph.
6. The Dijkstra's algorithm table displays possible next steps based on the shortest distance from the current station.
7. To find the shortest distance between two stations, users must click on all directly connected stations to update the table.
8. The table shows that [BS] Bond Street has two direct neighbors: [OC] Oxford Street and [GP] Green Park, with distances of 0.6 km and 1.4 km respectively.
9. The distance between [BS] Bond Street and itself is 0 km, making it an impossible route.
10. Users must select the station with the shortest distance from [BS] Bond Street as their next step.
11. In this case, users should select [OC] Oxford Street, which updates the table and sets [OC] Oxford Street as the current station to analyze.
12. The process is repeated until the entire table is filled in, allowing users to find the shortest route between two stations.
13. The final answer can be visualized on either the graph or Dijkstra's algorithm table, with the shortest route highlighted in red.
14. Users can submit their answers by listing the shortest journey from the start station to the end station.
15. The simulation also offers options for resetting the current underground network, selecting a new one, and accessing additional resources to test Dijkstra's algorithm knowledge.

Graph theory is a fundamental area of mathematics and computer science, focusing on the study of graphs, which are structures made up of vertices connected by edges. In this topic we covered the basic concepts of graphs, i.e. graph representation methods, special graphs, properties, metrics, significant algorithms and practical applications. Here are the main concepts you need to take from this module: Basic concepts: Vertices and edges: recognise the primary components of graphs. Types of graphs: differentiate between directed and undirected graphs, weighted and unweighted graphs, regular graphs, simple graphs and multigraphs. Special graphs: identify and understand complete graphs, bipartite graphs and trees. Bipartite graphs: understand bipartite graphs, where vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that every edge connects a vertex in one set to a vertex in the other. Graph representation: Adjacency matrix: learn to represent graphs using a matrix where rows and columns represent vertices and entries indicate the presence of edges. Adjacency list: understand how to use lists for graph representation, especially useful for sparse graphs. Degree sequence: representing a graph with its corresponding degree sequence. Graph properties and metrics: Degree of vertices: understand vertex degree and its importance in graph analysis. Paths and cycles: learn to identify and analyse paths, cycles and the shortest path between vertices. Connectivity: understand connected graphs, strongly connected components and weakly connected components. Sum of degrees and number of edges: recognise that the sum of the degrees of all vertices in an undirected graph is twice the number of edges (∑ degree(v) = 2|E|), where v represents vertices and |E| represents the number of edges. Graph isomorphism: understand conditions under which two graphs are structurally identical. Significant algorithms: Dijkstra's algorithm: learn to find the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices in a weighted graph with non-negative weights. Maximum matching: learn about finding the largest possible matching in a graph, especially in bipartite graphs, where a matching is a set of edges without common vertices. This topic will equip you with the basics to understand and analyse various types of graphs and their properties, develop algorithms for graph-related problems and apply graph theory concepts to practical scenarios in diverse fields. As you progress through your course, it is crucial to regularly assess your understanding and capabilities against the learning outcomes. This exercise is designed to help you reflect on your learning journey, identify areas where you may need to deepen your knowledge or skills, and develop a plan for improvement. Please follow the steps below: Review the learning outcomes. For each of this topic’s learning outcomes, rate your understanding on a scale of 1-5 (1 = very low, 5 = very high). Provide a brief explanation for your rating. Identify areas for improvement. Review your ratings and explanations: Identify any areas where you rated your understanding below a 4. For each area identified, describe specific aspects you find challenging or unclear. Create an action plan. For each identified knowledge gap, outline specific actions you will take to improve your understanding. Consider the following strategies: Reviewing the course materials and textbooks. Seek out additional resources that could aid your understanding. Practicing additional problems or exercises. Seeking help from the instructor or peers. Scheduling additional study sessions on the topic. Implement your action plan and regularly review your progress. Adjust your strategies as needed based on your ongoing self-assessment and any new feedback you receive. Remember, learning is a continuous process, and it’s okay to revise your plan to better suit your needs. Lesson 7.2 Isomorphic graphs adjacency matrix Video: Video Isomorphic graphs .

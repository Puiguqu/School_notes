The simplest way to understand this concept is by making an analogy with nature. In nature, the tree's primary components are the roots, trunk, branches, and leaves. In computer science, trees are usually represented upside down. Trees have many applications. They might be used in organization chart showing the structure of an organization and the relationships between relative ranks and positions. Trees can also be used to represent a file system showing how computer files are stored, and maintained, and making it easy to find and access them. Trees can also be used to represent a centralized version control system. Showing the relationship between the central copy of a project stored in the repository and the programmers working copies stored in their workstations. In computer science, trees are particularly useful. They are employed in a wide range of algorithms. They can be used to find the shortest path in a graph. They are used to construct efficient algorithm to locate items in a list. They can be used in games such as checker and chess and can help to determine winning strategies. They can be used to model procedures carried out using a sequence of decisions. A binary tree is a fundamental data structure in high-level programming. In this lecture, we gave an informal definition of a tree. In the next lecture, we will examine the properties of trees and how they are applied to solve real-world problems. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Video: Video Topic 8 introduction .

Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key In this lesson, we will discuss the concept of spanning trees of a graph. We will first define a spanning tree. We will then show how to construct a spanning tree with examples for clarification of the concept. Finally, we will define isomorphic spanning trees and give some examples. In many real life problems such as Internet multicasting, we might need to identify the trees that exist within a graph. What we call spanning trees. A more formal definition of a spanning tree of a graph G is a connected cycle-free sub graph of G which contains all the vertices of the graph G. For example, consider the graph G given below. T_1, T_2, T_3 and T_4 are all connected cycle-free sub-graphs of G containing all the vertices of G. Therefore, they are all spanning trees of the graph G. To get a spanning tree of a graph G, first we keep all the vertices of G, then we break all the cycle but keep the tree connected. For instance, let's consider the graph G1. If we break the cycles but keep all the vertices and keep the graph connected, we get four possible spanning trees. In the case of the graph G2, if we break the cycles, keep all the vertices, and keep the graph connected, we get eight possible spanning trees. In the case of the graph G3, if we break the cycles, keep all the vertices, and keep the graph connected, we get 16 possible spanning trees. Similarly to graphs, two spanning trees are said to be isomorphic if there exists a bijection preserving the adjacency between the two trees. Some of the spanning trees of a graph might be isomorphic to each other, which means they are the same. So, if we are asked to draw all the spanning trees of a graph, we are only interested in drawing the non-isomorphic ones. For instance, let's consider the following connected and undirected graph G. T1, T2, T3, and T4 are four spanning trees of G. Clearly T_1, T_3, and T_4 are all isomorphic to each other. However, T_1, T_3, and T_4 are all non-isomorphic to T_2. If we are asked to draw non-isomorphic trees of this graph, we only need to draw T_1 and T_2 or T_3 and T_2 or T_4 and T_2. In this lesson, we discussed the concept of spanning trees of a graph. We first defined a spanning tree. We then showed how to construct a spanning tree and also gave some examples. Finally, we defined isomorphic spanning trees and gave some examples. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Video: Video Topic 8 introduction .

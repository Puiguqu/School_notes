Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

A rooted tree is a directed tree with a distinguished vertex called the root, such that there is a directed path from the root to every other vertex. A rooted tree can be represented as a graph if one vertex has an in-degree of zero, while all other vertices have an in-degree of one. The depth or path length of a node in a tree is the number of edges from the root to that node. The height of a node in a tree is the longest path from that node to a leaf. The depth of a tree, also known as its height, is the maximum path length across all its nodes.

A binary tree is a rooted tree with every vertex having two or fewer children. A ternary tree is a rooted tree with every vertex having three or fewer children. An m-ary tree is a rooted tree with every vertex having m or fewer children. An m-ary tree is regular if every internal node has exactly m children.

The maximum number of vertices at level h in an m-ary tree is m^h, while the maximum number of edges in an m-ary tree of h levels is m_h + 1 - 1 / (m - 1).

Two graphs, trees, or trees with different degree sequences are not isomorphic. Two trees with the same degree sequence may or may not be isomorphic.

An isomorphism between two graphs is a bijection that preserves adjacency and non-adjacency. For rooted trees, an isomorphism also requires mapping the root of one tree to the root of the other tree.

Isomorphic trees as rooted trees have additional properties, such as having the same degree sequence at each level.

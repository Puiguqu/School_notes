Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

A relation R can be represented using matrices, where the matrix M_r has dimensions n_a x n_b, with element M_ij equal to one if a_i is related to b_j and zero otherwise. The set A contains elements {1, 2, 3, 4} and the set B contains elements {CS100, CS101, CS102, CS103}. The relation R can be represented by a matrix where the element at row i and column j represents the relationship between student i and course j. The union of two relations is a new set that contains all pairs of elements in at least one of the original relations, while the intersection contains only those pairs present in both relations. The union of two relations can be calculated using the joint (i.e., element-wise OR) of the matrices representing R and S, and the intersection can be calculated using the meet (element-wise AND). A relation on a set A can also be represented by a digraph, where an arrow from x to y indicates that x is related to y. The digraph for the relation "divides" on the set {1, 2, 3, 4} shows loops at each vertex indicating self-relations and other edges representing divisibility relations. Similarly, the digraph for the relation "less than or equal to" on the same set shows loops at each vertex and edges representing the relation between elements. In contrast, the digraph for the strictly less than relation has no loops because an element is not related to itself. The properties of a relation, including reflexivity, symmetry, anti-symmetry, transitivity, are also discussed in this lecture.

Overall, the text discusses three ways to represent relations: using matrices, directed graphs (digraphs), and explaining key concepts such as union, intersection, reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity. The examples provided illustrate how these methods can be used to model different types of relationships between sets and elements.

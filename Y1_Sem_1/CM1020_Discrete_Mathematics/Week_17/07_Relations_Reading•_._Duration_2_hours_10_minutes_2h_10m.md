# Relations Readingâ€¢ . Duration: 2 hours 10 minutes 2h 10m

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/supplement/stZ41/relations)

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences:

The textbook "Koshy" covers several topics related to relations, including their definition, graph and matrix representations, reflexivity, symmetry, anti-symmetry, transitivity, and other properties.

The student is asked to read extracts from the Koshy textbook, specifically pages 437-41, 443-46, 448, and 454-59.

After completing the reading, students are encouraged to attempt exercises found on pages 448 and 459-60.

Exercises 1-3, 7-9, 23, 25, 27, 30, 31, 34, and others have solutions at the back of the book in a section titled "Solutions to odd-numbered exercises".

Students are advised to consult this section if they get an answer wrong.

The video topic covers the definition of a relation versus function, which is discussed further in the reading material.

The practice assignment on the definition of a relation involves completing a task related to relations.

Another video topic explores matrix and graph representations of a relation.

The practice assignment for matrix and graph representations also involves completing a task.

A third video topic discusses the properties of a relation, specifically reflexivity, symmetry, anti-symmetry, and transitivity.

The reading material on these topics provides additional information on each property.

The practice assignment on the properties of a relation requires students to complete tasks related to reflexive, symmetric, anti-symmetric, and transitive relations.

Finally, there is a video topic on relation properties: transitivity, which summarizes key concepts.

The overall duration for each activity is specified in minutes (2-20 minutes).

The reading material covers the topics of relations, including definition, graph and matrix representations, reflexivity, symmetry, anti-symmetry, and transitivity.

You may contract your selection using shift + CTRL + arrow key. For screen readers that are incompatible with using arrow keys for shortcuts, you can replace them with the H J K L keys. Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key In this lesson, we will discuss another property of relations called transitivity. We will look at the behavior of the digraph of transitive relations, we will then explain the concept of the transitive closure of a relation. Now, let's move on to define what it means to say, "that a relation is transitive." A relation R on a set S is said to be transitive if and only if for all a, b, c, three elements of S. If a is related to b and b is related to c, then a must be related to c. Let's now examine some examples of relations and try to show whether or not they are transitive. Is the relation R defined by the pair x, y being an element of N if and only if x is less than or equal to y positive. The answer is yes because if x is less than or equal to y and y is less than or equal to z, then x is less than or equal to z. Now, let R be the relation defined by the set of pairs: the pair 2,3 3,2, and 2,2. Is this relation transitive? The answer is no. R is not transitive because three is related to two and two is related to three. However, three is not related to three. Finally, let R be the relation defined by the pair a, b is an element of R if and only if a is an ancestor of b. Is this relation transitive? The answer is yes. R is transitive because if a is an ancestor of b and b is an ancestor of c, then a is an ancestor of c. Let's now look at the following relation on a set S defined by its corresponding diagraph G. Let's try to show whether or not this relation is transitive. Clearly, this relation is not transitive because a is related to b and b is related to c, but a is not related to c. Or b is related to c and c is related to d, but b is not related to d. Let's try to find the minimum number of edges to be added to make this relation a transitive relation on S. We can see that a is related to b and b is related to c, but a is not related to c. Hence we need to add an edge from a to c. Also, we have b relates to c and c relates to d, but b is not related to d. Hence we need to add an edge from b to d. The relation is still not transitive as a now relates to c and c relates to d, but a is not related to d. Hence we need to add an edge from a to d. Finally, by adding three edges; a to c, b to d, and a to d, the enhanced relation is now transitive. The resulting enhanced relation is called the transitive closure of the original relation. In this lesson, we discussed another property of relations, this property is called transitivity. We explored the behavior of the diagraph of transitive relations. Finally, we showed how to find the transitive closure of a given relation. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Video: Video Topic 9 introduction .

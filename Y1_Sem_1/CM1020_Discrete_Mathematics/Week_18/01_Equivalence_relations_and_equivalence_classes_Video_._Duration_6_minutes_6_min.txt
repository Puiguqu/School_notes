Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving all key information, formulae, and technical details:

An equivalence relation on a set S is defined as a relation R that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. The relation R is reflexive if for all a in S, a is related to a. The relation R is symmetric if for all a and b in S, if a is related to b then b is also related to a. The relation R is transitive if for all a, b, and c in S, if a is related to b and b is related to c then a is also related to c.

An example of an equivalence relation on the set Z is the relation R where two elements a and b are related if and only if a modulus 2 is equal to b modulus 2. This relation is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive, making it an equivalence relation.

On the other hand, an example of a relation that is not an equivalence relation is the relation R on Z where two elements a and b are related if and only if a is less than or equal to b. This relation is reflexive but not symmetric, as there exist pairs (a, b) such that a is related to b but not vice versa.

The concept of equivalence classes is introduced for an equivalence relation R on a set S. The equivalence class of an element a in S is the subset of S containing all elements related to a through the relation R. For example, in the relation R where two elements are related if and only if they have the same modulus 2, the equivalence classes are {1} and {3}, as well as {2} and {4}.

In another example, the relation R on Z where two elements are related if and only if their difference is an even number results in two equivalence classes: {1, 3, 5} and {2, 4}.

Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key In this lesson, we will discuss equivalence relations. First, we will give a definition of equivalence relations, then we will give a brief definition of equivalence classes. We will also look at a number of examples that demonstrate these concepts. Let's begin by defining an equivalence relation. Let R be a relation on a set S. R is set to be an equivalence relation if and only if R is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. Now, let's have a look at an example of an equivalence relation. Let R be a relation on elements in Z where the pair a, b is an element of R, if and only if a modulus 2 is equal to b modulus 2 for all a, b elements in Z. In the previous lesson, we proved that this relation is reflexive as a is related to a for all a in Z, is symmetric as if a is related to b then b is related to a for all a, b in Z, is transitive as, if a is related to b and b is related to c, then a is related to c for all a, b, c elements of Z. R is therefore an equivalence relation, as it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. Now, let's have a look at an example of a relation that isn't an equivalence relation. Let R be a relation on elements in Z where the pair a, b is an element of R, if and only if, a is less than or equal to b. In the previous lesson, we have already proved that this relation is reflexive, as a is related to a for all a elements of Z. Is transitive as if a is related to b, and b is related to c, then a is related to c. However, this relation is not symmetric because there exist two elements a, b, such that a is related to b, but b is not related to a. For example, let's take the element two and three, two is less or equal to three, means two is related to three, but three is not less or equal to two, which means three is not related to two. This implies that R is not an equivalence relation as it is not symmetric. Now, we are going to discuss the concept of equivalence classes. Let R be an equivalence relation on a set S then, the equivalence class of an element a in S, is the subset of S containing all the elements related to a through the relation R. We can write the equivalence classes of an element a of S as follows. The equivalence class of the element a is the set of all x element of S such that x is related to a. As you can see, we put the elements a between square bracket to indicate the equivalence class of a. Let's now show this through an example. Consider the relation R on elements of S, where the pair a, b is an element of R if and only if a modulus 2 is equal to b modulus 2. We have previously shown that this relation is an equivalence relation. R is an equivalence relation with two equivalence classes, the class containing the elements one and three, and the class containing the elements two and four. Let's have a look at another example. Let R be a relation on elements in Z, where the pair a, b is an element of R, if and only if a Minus b is an even number. R is the set of pairs 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5 2, 4, 4, 2, 1, 3, 3, 1, 1, 5, 5, 1, 3, 5, and 5, 3. R is an equivalence relation with two equivalence classes, the class containing the elements one, three, and five and the class containing the elements two and four. In this lesson, we discussed the concept of equivalence relations. First, we gave a definition of equivalence relations, then we introduced the concept of equivalence classes. We also examined a number of examples that demonstrated both of these concepts. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 9.2 Equivalence, and partial and total order relations Video: Video Equivalence relations and equivalence classes .

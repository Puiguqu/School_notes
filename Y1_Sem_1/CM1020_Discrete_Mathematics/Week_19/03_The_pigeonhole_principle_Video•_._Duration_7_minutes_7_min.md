Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

The Pigeonhole Principle is a fundamental concept in mathematics that states if K+1 objects are placed into K boxes, then at least one box contains two or more objects. This can be proved by contra-positive, where assuming none of the boxes has more than one object leads to a contradiction with the initial statement. The basic version of the principle can be stated as: "If K+1 objects are placed into K boxes, then at least one box contains two or more objects."

To demonstrate this principle, consider a flock of 10 pigeons and 9 pigeonholes. One pigeonhole contains two pigeons, while the other eight contain one each. This illustrates how the principle can be applied to real-life scenarios.

The Pigeonhole Principle can also be used to prove that if a function F has K+1 elements in its domain and K elements in its co-domain, then it is not a one-to-one function. By creating boxes for each element of the co-domain and placing all elements from the domain into these boxes, we can show that at least one box contains two or more elements.

A generalized version of the Pigeonhole Principle states that if N objects are placed into K boxes, then there is at least one box containing at least the ceiling of N over K objects. This can be proved by contra-positive as well.

To apply this principle to a real-world problem, consider selecting cards from a standard deck of 52 cards to guarantee that at least four cards of the same suit are chosen. Using the generalized version of the Pigeonhole Principle, we can show that if N is the number of cards selected, then at least one box (suit) contains at least four cards.

The smallest value of N that satisfies this condition is 13, meaning we need to select a minimum of 13 cards to ensure that at least four cards of the same suit are chosen.

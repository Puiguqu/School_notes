Then we will discuss a more generalized version of the pigeonhole principle. Finally, we will look at the application of this principle by working through some examples that put it into practice. The pigeonhole principle is one of the simplest and most useful ideas in mathematics. Let's give a definition of this principle. Let K be a positive integer. A basic version of the principle says that if K plus one objects are placed into K boxes then at least one of the boxes contains two or more objects. This can be proved by contra-positive. Let's suppose none of the K boxes has more than one object. Then the total number of objects would be at-most K. This contradicts our initial statement that says that we have K plus one object. Therefore, there exists one box which contains more than one object. Now, let's have a look at an example to demonstrate this principle. Suppose we have a flock of 10 pigeons and we only have nine pigeonholes. As you can see here, one pigeonhole contains two pigeons. Whereas the other eight pigeonholes contain one pigeon each. Now, let's use the pigeonhole principle to prove that if the domain of a function F has K plus one elements and its domain has K elements then this function is not a one-to-one function. We began by creating a box Y for each element Y of the co-domain of F. Then we put all the elements X from the domain in a box Y such that Y is the image of X or X is the pre-image of Y. So each box Y contains all the pre-images of Y, as there are K plus one element in the domain and only K boxes. So at least one box contains two or more elements. This means that at least one element of the co-domain has more than one pre-image. Therefore, F is not a one-to-one function. Now, let's look at a more generalized version of the pigeonhole principle. If N objects are placed into K boxes, then there is at least one box containing at least the ceiling of N over K objects. We can prove this by contra-positive as follows. Suppose that none of the boxes contains more than the ceiling of N over K minus 1 object. Then the total number of objects is at most K times the ceiling of N over K minus 1 which is strictly less than K times N over K plus 1 minus the 1 which is equal to N. This is a contradiction of our initial hypothesis which says that the total number of objects is equal to N. This completes the proof. Let's now try to solve the following problem. How many cards must be selected from a standard deck of 52 cards to guarantee that at least four cards of the same suit are chosen? We begun by assuming four boxes one for each suit. Using the generalized pigeonhole principle, we know that at least one box contains at least the ceiling of N over four cards. Where N is the number of cards selected. Therefore, at least four cards on one suit are selected if the ceiling of N over 4 is greater than or equal to 4. The smallest value of N to satisfy this condition is 13. Therefore, we need to select a minimum of 13 cards to ensure that at least four cards of the same suit are selected. In this lecture, we introduced and discussed the basic pigeonhole principle. Then we looked at a more generalized version of this principle. Finally, we work through some real-life examples to demonstrate its application. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Video: Video Topic 10 introduction .

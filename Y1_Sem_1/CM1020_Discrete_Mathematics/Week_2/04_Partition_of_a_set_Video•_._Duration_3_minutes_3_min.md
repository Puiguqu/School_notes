Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

A partition of an object is a subdivision into parts that are completely separated from each other yet form the whole object. Data partitioning has various applications in Computer Science, such as big data analysis. Two sets A and B are said to be disjointed if their corresponding intersection is equal to the empty set. This means they have no element in common.

A partition of a set A is a set of subsets A_i of A, where all subsets are disjointed and the union of all subsets is equal to A. The concept of disjoint sets can be visualized using Venn diagrams. For example, the sets A_1 to A_5 are subsets of A, demonstrating that they are disjointed.

The union of all subsets A_i is equal to the set A, which means the collection of subsets is a partition of A. To determine if a collection of subsets is a partition of a given set S, one must check if the union of all subsets is equal to S and if all elements are mutually disjointed.

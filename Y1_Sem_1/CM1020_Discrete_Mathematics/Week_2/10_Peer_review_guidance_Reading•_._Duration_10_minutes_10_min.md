Peer review is a collaborative process where students, scholars, or researchers evaluate each other's work to provide feedback and learn from one another. In an academic setting, peer reviews involve carefully reading a peer's assignment to critique its content and arguments. As part of the Computer Science programme, peer reviews may be required assignments. There are two parts to peer-graded assignments: submitting your own assignment and grading a minimum number of peers' submitted assignments. To receive a grade for your own assignment, you must complete both tasks.

When grading your peer's work, you will be provided with a rubric that clearly describes the assignment components and the type of responses that correspond to each possible grade. Rubrics are used to ensure grading consistency and help learners understand the expectations of each assignment. The purpose of peer review is not just to critique but to offer constructive feedback that can help authors improve their work.

Peer review challenges you to critically evaluate another's work, sharpening your analytical skills. By identifying strengths, weaknesses, and gaps in someone else's writing, you develop a keen eye for detail, which is invaluable in your own work and academic pursuits. Peer review also improves writing and research skills by providing insights into effective techniques.

Through peer review, you can learn from each other, gain new perspectives on your work, and develop analytical and evaluative skills essential for academic success and professional development. The process fosters collaborative learning and academic integrity. It encourages constructive feedback and dialogue, leading to the development of a supportive academic network.

Participating in peer review prepares you for future academic and professional experiences by mirroring professional scholarly review processes. By engaging in peer review, you reinforce your own knowledge and understanding of the subject matter, leading to better retention and mastery of the content. Peer review develops empathy and communication skills by providing opportunities to give constructive, respectful, and helpful feedback.

It also provides insight into the review process, demystifying academic publishing and research presentation. By participating in peer reviews, you gain exposure to diverse research topics and methodologies, which can spark interest in interdisciplinary study or collaboration. Finally, successfully engaging in peer review enhances your confidence in your own academic abilities by providing a sense of accomplishment and assurance in your skills and knowledge.

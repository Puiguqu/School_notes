Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key Augustus De Morgan was a British mathematician. He is known for having formulated De Morgan's laws. De Morgan's laws describe how mathematical statement and concepts are related to their opposites. In set theory, De Morgan's laws relate to the intersection and union of set through their complements. The structure of De Morgan's laws, whether applied to sets, propositions, or logic gates is always the same. Now let's have a look at De Morgan's laws and prove their correctness using either Venn diagrams or membership tables. The first law states that the complement of the union of two sets is equal to the intersection of their complements. That is, given two sets A and B, the complement of the union of A and B is equal to the intersection of the compliment of A and the complement of B. The second law states that the complement of the intersection of two sets is equal to the union of their complements. That is, given two sets A and B, the complement of the intersection of A and B is equal to the union of the complement of A and the complement of B. Now let's try to prove correctness of De Morgan's laws using membership tables. We first prove that the complement of the union of A and B is equal to the complement of A intersection the complement of B. We can build the membership table as follows. The first orange column corresponds to the complement of the union of A and B. The second orange column corresponds to the intersection of the compliment of A and the complement of B. As you can see, both columns are the same, hence these two sets are the same or are equivalent. Similarly, we can prove the correctness of the second law using the following membership table. As you can see, the column corresponding to the compliment of the intersection of A and B and the column corresponding to the union of the complement of A and the complement of B, both in orange are the same. Hence, these two sets are the same or they are equivalent. We can also prove the correctness of De Morgan's laws using Venn diagrams. We first build the Venn diagram for A union B, which means anything in A or B. Then we build the Venn diagram for the complement of A union B, which means all the area in orange here, but anything in the universal set, but not in A or not in B. The following Venn diagram correspond to the complement of A, so which means all the orange area here correspond to the complement of A, which is anything in the universal set again, which is not in A. The following Venn diagram corresponds to the complement of B, which is again anything in the universal set which is not in B. Therefore, Venn diagram for the complement of A intersection complement of B is as follows. As you can see as anything, but not in A and not in B. If you look at those two Venn diagram, the area in orange in both Venn diagram is the same, therefore, the complement of A union B is the same as the complement of A intersection the complement of B. We now prove the second law of De Morgan's laws, which means that the compliment of the intersection of A and B is the same as the compliment of A union the compliment of B. We first build the Venn diagram for the intersection of A and B, which is as follows, this area here is common to A and B, therefore area represents the area for A intersection B. Hence, the complement of A intersection B can be represented by the following Venn diagram, which means anything in universal set which is not common to A and B. Similarly, where it represents the complement of A switch can be represented by the following Venn diagram, which is anything in the universal set which is not in A. Here is the complement of B, which is again, anything in the universal set but not in B, and here is the complement of A union the complement of B. As you can see both Venn diagrams here, the area colored in orange are the same therefore, we can safely say the complement of the intersection of A and B is the same as the complement of A union the complement of B. Now let's have a look at an example of how De Morgan's laws work in practice. In this example, we consider the universal set to contain the following elements, 1, 2, 3, 4 and so on till 9. A and B are two subsets of the universal set U. A has the following elements, 1, 2, 3, 4 and B have 4, 5, 6 and 7 as its element. Therefore, A union B has got the following element, which is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 whereas the intersection of A and B have our only element which is 4, as it's the only element that those two sets have in common. The complement of A union B will have anything that's in the universal set but not in the union therefore it will have the element 8 and 9, whereas the compliment of the intersection of A and B has the following elements. The complement of A has all the elements that are in the universal set but not in A, therefore it'll have the following elements, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, whereas the complement of B has the following elements. Therefore, the complement of A intersection the complement of B has the following element, 8 and 9, which are the same as the element of the complement of A union B. We can see that the complement of A intersection the complement of B, is the same as the complement of A union B. Similarly, the complement of A union the complement of B, has the following element. As you can see those elements are the same as the element of the complement of A intersection B, then we can clearly see that the compliment of A union the complement of B is equal to the complement of A intersection B. In this lecture, we introduced De Morgan's laws and proved their correctness using either membership tables or Venn diagrams. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 1.2 Set representation and manipulation Video: Video The representation of a set using Venn diagrams .

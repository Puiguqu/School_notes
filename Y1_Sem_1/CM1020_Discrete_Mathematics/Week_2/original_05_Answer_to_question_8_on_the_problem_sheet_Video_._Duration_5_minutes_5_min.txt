You may contract your selection using shift + CTRL + arrow key. For screen readers that are incompatible with using arrow keys for shortcuts, you can replace them with the H J K L keys. Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key We will now go through a couple of exercises on set theory. Question 1, let A, B, and C be subsets of a universal set U. Part a; draw a three binary digit labeled Venn diagram, depicting A, B, and C in such a way that they divide U into eight disjoint regions. Hint: if the first digit is 1, let it be set A, if the second digit is 1, let it be in set B, and if the third digit is 1, let it be in set C. Part b; the subset X of U is defined by the following membership table. Identify the region X on your diagram. Describe the region you have identified and set notation as simply as you can. Part c; let Y be the set represented by the region 000, 011, 101, 110, and 111. Describe the set Y using set notation. Part a, is to draw a three binary digit labeled Venn diagram depicting A, B, and C in such a way that they divide U into eight disjoint regions. Remember that if the first digit is 1, let it be in set A. If the second digit is 1, let it be in set B, and if the third digit is 1, let it be in set C. The Venn diagram is shown there and as you can see, it has indeed divided the universal set into eight disjoint regions. For instance, the region 1-0-1 contains elements that are in A, because the first digit is 1, not in B, because the second digit is 0, and in C, because the third digit is 1. Part b; the subset X is defined by the following membership table. Identify the region X on your diagram and describe the region you have identified in set notation as simply as you can. From the membership table, we see that X comprises 001, 100, 101, and 110. These are the values of A, B, and C, which give a value of X of 1 in the table. They are circled in the Venn diagram, as you can see there. The simplest way to depict this, is to say X is equal to the union of A and C minus the intersection of B and C. So it's the union of A and C minus the elements 111 and 011. Part c; let Y be the set represented by the region 000, 011, 101, 110, and 111. Describe the set Y using set notation. What we find is that Y is equal to the complement of the symmetric difference of A and B and C. Why is this true? The symmetric difference of A and B and C contains the elements that are in A, B, and C, but are not common to any of them. The symmetric difference of A and B and C is equal to 100, 010, and 001. For instance, 100 is only in A, it's not in B, and it's not in C. What is the complement of the symmetric difference? The complement contains all the elements that are in the universal set, but are not in the symmetric difference, A and B and C. The complement is equal to U minus the symmetric difference of A and B and C and this is equal to 000, 011, 101, 110, and 111. This is equal to the set Y and is shown in the diagram circled. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 1.2 Set representation and manipulation Lesson 1.3 Extra resources Reading: Reading Sets problem sheet .

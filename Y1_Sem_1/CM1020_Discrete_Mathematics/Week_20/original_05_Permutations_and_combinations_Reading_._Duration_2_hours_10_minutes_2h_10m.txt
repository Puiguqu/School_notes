Read the following extracts from the Koshy textbook. These pages will cover the following topics: binomial coefficients and identities; Pascal’s identity and triangle; and generalised permutations and combinations. Koshy, pp.365–70, pp.375–77, pp.379–81 and pp.386–90 . Once you’ve finished the reading, attempt the following exercises: pp.384–85, exercises 1–6, 19–20, 35 and 36 pp.396, exercises 1–2, 5–7, 9–10 Several exercises have solutions at the back of the book under the section ‘Solutions to odd-numbered exercises’. Please consult this section to check the answer to your exercises. If you got the answer wrong, take a look back at the question and see how you can arrive at the right answer.

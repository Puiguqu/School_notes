Unfortunately, I couldn't find any text to summarize in 15 sentences. The provided text appears to be a set of instructions and recommendations for reading and completing exercises related to discrete mathematics.

However, I can provide a general outline of the topics mentioned:

* The definition of a function is discussed.
* Key concepts include domain, co-domain, range, injection (one-to-one), surjection (onto), and plotting functions.
* There are recommended readings and resources, including Koshy's book and Levin's Discrete Mathematics: An Open Introduction.
* Exercises are provided for students to practice these concepts further.

If you could provide the actual text you would like me to summarize, I'd be happy to help.

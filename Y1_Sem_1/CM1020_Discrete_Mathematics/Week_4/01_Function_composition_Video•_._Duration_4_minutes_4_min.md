Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The lecture discusses function composition, which involves combining two functions F and G to create a new function F ∘ G. The output of F ∘ G can be calculated in two stages: first, input X into G to get G(X), then use G(X) as an input into F to get F(G(X)). An example illustrates this concept, where F doubles the input and G squares it; applying them together results in a function that doubles the square of the input. Function composition can be visualized using three sets A, B, and C, with functions G and F mapping between them. This visualization demonstrates how F ∘ G applies first to an element in A and then maps the result through F, resulting in an output in set C. The lecture provides an example of two functions F and G defined over the same domain and codomain (R), where F(x) = 2x + 3 and G(x) = 3x + 2. To illustrate function composition, we apply these functions to an element of R, say "1". First, applying G(1) gives us 5, then applying F(5) gives us 13. This example demonstrates that F ∘ G is not the same as G ∘ F, meaning that the order of composition matters.

In general, when composing two functions F and G, the output of G becomes the input to F, resulting in a new function F ∘ G. The function composition relation is not commutative, meaning that reversing the order of composition changes the result.

This lecture introduces function composition as an essential concept for understanding many mathematical and real-world applications.

This is not a typical math lesson in which a specific topic and problems are presented. The text appears to be a transcript of a video lecture or a learning platform's content, where various topics related to functions and mathematical concepts are briefly discussed.

There isn't a specific problem or question that requires a step-by-step solution. However, I can provide an overview of the topics covered in the lesson:

1. **Functions**: The text discusses what functions are, examples of functions (e.g., F of X = 2X), and how to prove that a function is bijection.
2. **Bijective Functions**: The lesson explains what bijective functions are, how to prove a function is bijective, and provides practice assignments.
3. **Inverse Functions**: The text discusses finding the inverse function of a given function (e.g., F-1 of X = X/2) and its properties (e.g., composition).
4. **Symmetry with Respect to the Line Y = X**: The lesson explains how to visualize functions and their inverses on a graph, highlighting the symmetry between the two.

If you'd like, I can help with solving problems related to these topics or provide additional explanations on any of the concepts covered in this text.

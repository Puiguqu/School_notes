[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/UR9TP/webinar-on-functions)

This appears to be a transcript of an online learning session or lecture on functions and sets. The transcript covers various topics, including:

1. A discussion on the concept of a function, its domain, and range.
2. An explanation of why minus 1 is not included in the domain of a certain function.
3. A proof that a given function is one-to-one (injective).
4. A problem on sets, where the learner needs to show that a power set of A union B is a subset of another power set.

The transcript does not provide any direct answers or solutions to the problems. Instead, it presents the topics and problems in a detailed manner, allowing learners to understand the concepts and work through the problems on their own.

If you're looking for help with these topics or need assistance with the problems presented in the transcript, I can try to provide guidance and explanations. However, please note that I'll need more context and specific questions to address your needs effectively.

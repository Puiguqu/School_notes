Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key Hello everyone. Sorry for the delay, again my name is Lahcen Ouarbya and you probably already know me from previous webinars and I am the module leader for Discrete Mathematics and today's topic it will be about functions. What I will be giving you is a summary of what you need to know about functions then after that will be able to answer any question that you might have. Well, let's start. What is a function? A function is a relation between a set of inputs and a set of outputs. It takes one input and map it to exactly one output and that is what a function is. I think you have seen this before so a function takes an element from one input and maps it back to an element in the set 2 which is a set of outputs. Each elements in the input can be matched to exactly one element in the output. As you already know the set of elements in the inputs are called the domain and the set of elements and outputs are called the co-domain of the function. You might have seen these in the slides before, so a function is defined from a set A to a set B. Is an assignment of exactly one element of a B to each element of A. What does this mean? If you one element of A it has exactly one element in B which is the co-domain. As you've already know we're ready to function f defined from A to B, A is the domain, B is the co-domain. We can also write a formula like this x is an element of the domain A and x we map it to f of x which is the image of x which is y and y is an element of the co-domain which is B, so you've already seen this I'm just going through this quickly. Terminology that we use in the function. Function f is defined from A to B, A is the domain and B is the co-domain of the function and the range is the set of elements of the co-domain that have a pre-image so that is what the base some element of B here might not have a pre-image in A, so they are not elements in the range. We're going to look at an example and I'll show you exactly what they mean. Let's look at this example. We've got a set A has got all those elements, which is strings on, sea, land, sky and set B has got all those elements which is integer 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 and then we have a function that maps a string an element of A to the number of characters it contains. For example, on is an element, how many characters it has got? It has got two characters and so on is mapped to two. Sea has got three characters is mapped to three. Land has got four characters so we map it to four and sky has got three characters then we map it to three. The domain of this function is the whole A, the co-domain of the function is the whole B. However, the range of the function is only those elements. Because there is no string here that has got one character or no string here has got five or six characters, so what we say we say that two is the image of on, three is the image of sea also the image of sky, four is the image of land, and we're also say that on is the pre-image of two, sea and sky are pre-images of three, and land is a pre-image of four. The range has got only those elements that have pre-images in the domain. That's the terminology that we've used so this is another example that you might have seen in the videos. Solvable A has got 0, 2, 3 and 4, and I've got B which has got all those elements from 1-9 and I've got a function that takes an element of A and maps it to an element of B, so it takes another x and it doubles it and adds one to it. For example, 0 we have 2 times 0 plus 1 and it maps it to one. 1, 2 times 1 plus 1 is 2 so is 3, so 2, 2 times 2 plus 1 is 5, A maps 3-7 and maps 4-9. Again the domain is the whole A, the co-domain is the whole B however the range is got only those elements that are highlighted in red which are the elements that have three images. I've already said this so, we all have seen this visualizing what a function is. We've got a domain A and co-domain B and I've got a function that maps an element of A to element of B, so you've got x and you've got A maps x to y. The image of x is y is the image of x also we can say that the pre-image of y is a x is the pre-image of y and here is the set of all the elements which is a set of element that have three images which is a subset of the co-domain and that is called the range of the function and I think we have seen this example which we can just escape. We've looked at this example here. We've function defined from z to z which is maps an integer to another integer with f of x is equal to the absolute value of x, so we need to find the domain, the co-domain and the range of the function and also find the set of images of one. The domain is z, so the co-domain is also z, however the range is the set of all positive integers and zero so 0, 1, 2, 3 and so on, that is the range because the absolute value is always positive or is equal to 0 so the absolute value of 0 is 0, the absolute value of minus 1 is 1, absolute value of 1 is 1 and so on, so the absolute value of all negative numbers is the corresponding positive number. What are the pre-images of minus 1 of 1 is just f of minus 1 is equal to f of 1 is equal to 1 that for the set of pre-images of 1 minus 1 and 1. This is another example that we have looked at, so it is the function g is defined from R to R with g is equal to g of x is equal to x squared plus 1, so we need to find the domain, the co-domain and the range of g and also find the pre-images of five. Again, the domain is just R, the co-domain is just R, so the domain and co-domain of this function g is just R and every element, if you take any element in R and you squared it then when we squared it is greater or equal to 0 because if x is equal to 0, x squared is equal to 0 so the smallest element in range will be when x is equal to 0 therefore x squared plus 1 is 0 squared plus 1 is equal to 1, so the range of g is the set of elements greater or equal to 1, so 1 and so on to the plus infinity. That is what is the range of R. Again to find the pre-images 5 there are g of minus 2 is minus 2 squared plus 1 which is 5, g of 2 is 2 squared plus 5 and the pre-images of 5 are minus 2 and 2. Here we also looked at plotting function but we didn't really go into detail to do the differentiation and all that. Any straight line function has got this form here. Ax plus b where a and b are two constants, f of x is equal a times x plus b, so all this is like a straight line which passes through zero and b when x is 0 f of x is b and the gradient is a. If a is strictly greater than zero then we say that this function is increasing, it's going up. To show that a function is increasing, you need to show that if you take any two inputs x_1 and x_2, if x_1 is less or equal to x_2, then also the image of x_1 is less or equal to the image of x_2 that's for to show that a function is increasing. Take this example here, f of x is equal to 3x plus 2. F of 0 is 2, f of 1 is 5, f of 2 is 8, f of 3 is 11 and so on f of 4 is 14, so you can see that this function is increasing is a straight line because three is positive therefore this function is increasing, you take any two numbers x_1 and x_2 so we have here f of x_1 here, we have f of x_2 here, so you can see that if x_1 is less than x_2, then f of x_1 is also less than f of x_2. Is just an example of an increasing function. If we have a is a negative number then this function is decreasing, what do we mean with a decreasing function? If you take two inputs, x_1 with x_1 less or equal to x_2, then f of x_1 is greater or equal to f of x_2, so similarly to increase it we just have to change this instead of less or equal to greater than or equal to x_2. If we look at this example here, we'll go f of x is equal to minus 3x plus 2. Then, if you draw this function here you can see that it's decreasing. When x increase f of x decreases so again you can see like if you have x_1 less than x_2 you can see that f of x_1 is greater than f of x_2, so it's a decreasing function. Then we looked at quadratic equations or quadratic functions they've got this formula. A constant a times x squared plus b times x a constant b times x plus a constant c with a is different from zero because if a is equal to 0 it will be a linear function. Then we looked at some example, we looked at x squared, the graph of x squared. If you see that is the range of the function this is the domain of the function and this is the co-domain but the range is also only the positive integers plus the value is zero. If we again do x squared plus 1 you can see that we just push the curve up by one and the range again will be from one to infinity the domain will be the whole R and and so on, so this is just examples to show you. Then we also looked if you have a function a times x squared. Here I've got a 1/ squared, here I've got 1/4 of x squared and so on, so you can see that if I take a and I take here minus a, then curves will be exactly symmetric with respect to the x-axis. If I take this curve here for 1/2 of x squared and this curve here minus 1/2 of x squared, you can seen that they're symmetric with respect to the x-axis. Then we also looked at some exponential functions. We looked at some exponential functions which are functions of the form f of x is equal b^x is not x^b but b^x where b is strictly greater than zero and b different from one, and b is called the base. For example, for b is equal to 2, f of x is equal to 2^x. Hence f of 2 is 2^2 which is 4. If b is equal 1/2, f of x is equal 1/2^x, therefore f of 2 is just 1/2^2 which is a 1/4 and this is what we call exponential function. Then we looked at some formula that you can use with exponents. If you have b^x times b^y is equal to b^x plus y. Again if I have b^x over b^y, it's just b^x minus y and if I have b^x the whole thing to the power of y is equal to b^x plus x times y. Again a times b the whole to the power of x is a^x, b^x. If I have a over b the whole thing to the power of x is just a^x over b^x. If I have b to the power of minus x is equal to 1 over b^x. It's just something that you can use when you're working with powers. Then we looked at some exponential functions with some examples. If b is greater than one which is the base, then we say that the function is an exponential growth and the function will have this form and it will always pass from this point 0 and 1 and that is your domain minus infinity to plus infinity and your domain is zero to infinity, zero not included, and thus is the x-axis is an horizontal asymptote means the curve when x goes towards minus infinity, this curve here get closer to the x-axis but it will never touch the x-axis. That's what we call horizontal asymptote. This is just an example for the exponent 4 if the base is 2^x then if the base, a is between 0 and 1, then we say that this function is an exponential decay, is decreasing. Instead of increasing before, the function is decreasing, so it goes from this is where it passes from 0, 1 always passes from 0, 1 and we say that this function is an exponential decay and that's your domain and the same thing that's your range and that is also an horizontal asymptote. If we have an example with the base is equal to 1/2, the function f of x 1/2^x has got this form and it's also an exponential decay. We looked very quickly on what is a linear function, what is a quadratic function, what is an exponential function and we give a couple of examples. Now I'm going onto the main thing, the main thing is we need to show that some functions satisfy some properties. One of the main properties that we're looking at is injective functions or one-to-one functions also we will be looking what does it mean to say that a function is surjective or onto functions. Function is said to be a one-to-one or injective, so one-to-one and injective means the same things either you can say injective or you can say one-to-one, so a function f defined from A to B is said to be an injective function or one-to-one function if and only if, if you take any two elements in the domain A, take any two elements a and b in a. If a is different from b then their images are different as well. What does it mean? You cannot find two different elements in the domain which have the same images. If you find two elements in the domain that have the same image, then the function is not a one-to-one function or is not an injective function, and that's what we mean with injection. Or this here is equivalent to this. If you take two elements, a and b in the domain, if they have the same image, then they must be the same they cannot be different, so there are two ways of proving that a function is an injective function or is a one-to-one function. Is either you use this, start from any two elements assume they're different then show that their images must be different, or you can use this here, take two element and you assume that they have the same image then show that these two elements cannot be different by showing that they must be equal, and that's what we mean with injective function or one-to-one function. What I can go now if we look at this example here that you might have seen. I'll go a function here it takes an element from A, A has got 1, 2, 3 and 4 and it takes A, and it doubles the input so for A is equal to 1, 2 times 1 is 2. Two it would give us image of 4, the image of 3 is 6 the image of 4 is 8. This function is one-to-one as you can see here each element has a unique image. One and two they are different, they have two different images, you cannot find two elements in here which have the same image, so this function is a one-to-one. However, if we look at this function x modules 2, so the function g takes an element x in A and gives you as output x mod 2 which means the remainder of dividing x by 2, that's what x mod 2 means. Let's look, what's 1 mod 2? 1 mod 2 is 1, 2 mod 2 is 0, 3 mod 2 is 1, 4 mod 2 is 0. What you can see all odd numbers 1 and 3 they have the same image same thing as even numbers 2 and 4 they have the same image 0. We can tell here that this function is not one-to-one function because it suffices to find two elements which are different and they have the same image before you can say one is different from three however, g of 1 is equal to g of 3 is equal to 1. Or you can say one or two is different from four however the image of 2 which is 0 and the image of 4 which is 0, they are different but they still have the same image. Then this function g is not a one-to-one function or an injective function. Now let's look at this example because here it's easy to see because we have a finite number of elements. Let's look at how we can prove if a function is a one-to-one or an injective function if we have an infinite numbers of inputs. The domain is R and the co-domain is R so it's an infinite number, we can't just pick a few number, we can't just look. We need to show that this function, f of x which is plus 3 is an injection or is a one-to-one function. Proof 1 we can use this that we've done before. We can start from taking two elements because now we need to show which for any two element in general we can't just pick two. Let's see, we can take any two elements we call them a and b in R and we need to show that if this is true, then this must be true. We need to show that if they are the same element so this is our assumption. We take two numbers a and b then we stopped by this. We assume that f of a is equal to f of b means a and b have the same image, what does that mean? We substitute f of a by its expression, which is 2 times 8 plus 3, we substitute f of b by 2 times b plus 3, we simplify by 3 we remove 3 then we have 2a is equal to b. This implies we divide by 2 and we have a is equal to b, what does this mean? That we can taken any two different elements a and b. If they have the same image then they must be equal they cannot be different, that's one way. If we do that you can say therefore this function is injective. Or we can start from the other way, we start using this. Second proof, we take two elements a and b and we need to show that if a is different from b, then f of a is different from f of b. By the way, this statement in logic is equivalent to this statement and if you overall have seen the logic topic this statement is the contrapositive of this statement. This statement and this statement say the same thing. I'll explain that in topic 3 when I get to look propositional logic. We can take the start from two element we'll call them a and b, and we assume that a is different from b. What does that mean? That means 2 times a is different from 2 times b. If I have 3 in both side that means that 2 times a plus 3 is different from 2 times b. That means, what is this? This is just f of a and this is what's f of b therefore f of a is different from f of b. We start by the assumption a is different from b, then we're arrive to also the image of a must be different from the image of b. Then, once you do that you can say that this function is injective. Now, as I say you can either use this or use this. You don't need to use both of them, just one of them is enough to show that the function is a one-to-one function or is an injective function. Let's look at this function and show that this function is not an injection or is not a one-to-one function. When the function is not one-to-one it suffices to find two different elements which have the same image, that's all we need to do here. I say f of 5 is equal 5 squared, and f of minus 5 is equal minus 5 squared so which is 25 so minus 5 is different from 5 however the same minus 5 and 5 have the same image, hence we can say that this function is not injective or we can say minus 1 and 1 f of minus 1 is equal 1, f of 1 is equal 1, however minus 1 and 1 are different then this function is not a one-to-one function or is not an injective function. Or you can say minus 2 and 2 f of minus 2 is minus 2 squared which is 4, f of 2 is 2 squared which is 4, so minus 2 and 2 are different however they have the same image then this function is not a one-to-one function. If we look at this function here I can see that minus 5 is here and 5 is there they are different however they have the same image which is 25. Now let's change the domain because the domain here it is R to R. If I change domain now to be R plus to R, now the function becomes a one-to-one function. We start from a and b are elements of the domain which is R plus, remember there's no negative numbers in the domain. Now we need to show that f of a is equal to f of a b then a is equal to b. We need to show that if two elements have the same image then they must be equal. Look at f of a is equal to f of b that's our initial assumption so we assume that f of a is equal to f of b then we substitute f of a by f of a and f of b by their expressions means a square is equal to b squared. This means a is equal to b you know why? Because a and b are an element of R plus so they can't be negative therefore they can only be the only option if a squared is equal to b square as both a and b are positive means that a is equal to b. We started from the assumption, f of a is equal to f of b and we arrive that a must be equal to b. Then the functions and all you can use the other proof we start by the assumption a is different from b then we arrive to a conclusion which f of a must be different from f of b. Let's start, so we assume that two elements a and b are elements of the domain which is R plus then we assume that a is different from b, what does that? That means a squared is different from b squared, the reason for this because a and b are positive real numbers or there is no negative real numbers in the domain. That shows that f of a is different from f of b then you can go and say that the function is injective. Now I hope you understand the function is injective I can answer more questions I've finished this. Let's now go to another property which is surjective functions or onto functions. By definition a function f defined from the domain A to co-domain B is said to be an onto function if and only if every element of the co-domain b every element of b has at least one pre-image in a, at least one. It can have more but if there is one element in b which has no pre-image in a, then the function is not an onto function or is not a surjective function. Let's see. We can write this, a function f is said to be an onto function or a surjective function if and only if, for all y in b remember this is the co-domain B there exists an x in the domain A such that f of x is equal to y, which means that for all y and b there exists a pre-image x of y in A. That's what it means. We're also because every element in B has a pre-image, therefore the range is equal to the co-domain. Sometime if you've already worked or asked to find the range of the function and the co-domain of the function if they are equal, then straight away you can conclude that the function is an onto function. If there are different, the co-domain and the range of the function, then you can say that this function is not an onto function because the range is different from the co-domain. Now let's look at an example that you have seen before, so let's look at this example f of x is equal to x and that is f of 1 is 2, f of 2 is 4, f of 3 is 6, f of 4 is 8, so this function, as you can see every element here end up in a co-domain has a pre-image and you can see that the co-domain 2, 4, 6, 8, and the range of the function also 2, 4, 6, 8, so the range is equal to the co-domain then this function is surjective or is one-to-one or an onto function actually this function is one-to-one and onto can you see every element has a unique image and also every element in here has at least one per image. Let's look at the same example that we've seen before g of x is equal to x mod 2, g of 1 and g of 3 is equal to 1, g of 2 and g of 4 is equal to 0. The range of this function is 0 and 1 is only these two elements however the co-domain has got 0, 1, 2, 3, so you can see that the co-domain is different from the range then we can say that this function is not an onto function or we can say the element 2 in a co-domain has no pre-image or you can say 3 has no pre-image then the function is not a surjective function or is not an onto function. Now let's look at this function that we've seen before and we need to see if this function is onto or not. The domain is R set of all even numbers the co-domain is R on all real numbers, and f of x is 2 times x plus 3. Let's do that. What we need to show we need to show that this function is an onto function. Where let y be an element of R show that there exists an element x in R so this is the co-domain and this is the domain such that f of x is equal to 1. That's what we need to show, we need to show for every element y in the domain, we can find x in my co-domain such that y is the image of x or x is the pre-image of y. We start from f of x is equal to y, well, we start from the assumption then we try to find x in terms of y, that's how we do. We start from f of x is equal to 1 then next step is to substitute f of x by its value, then next step is try to find x write x in terms of y. We start from f of x is equal to y, then we substitute f of x base value, then we have 2 of x, 2 times x plus 3 is equal to y, then we substitute 3 from both sides, we have is equal to y minus 3, then we have x is equal to y minus 3/2. If y is an element of R, then y minus 3/2 is also an element of R. For every y in the co-domain we can find a pre-image for it which is just y minus 3/2. For every element in the co-domain y, we can find a pre-image x for it and this x is just y minus 3/2 which is also an element of R. Therefore, once you do that you can say that the function is an onto function because we just showed in general that gets it taking an element y from R which is the co-domain we can always find an element x which is equal to y minus 3/2 which is such that x is the pre-image of y or y is the image of f of x and we can say that this function is surjective or an onto function. Be careful of the domains sometimes, be careful. Now, if I look at this function here f is defined from R to R, that is the domain R and co-domain and f of x is equal to x squared. So x squared is not surjective so we need to show that this function is not an onto function or is not a surjective function. Proof: let y be an elements of R which is the co-domain we need to show that there exists x in R such that f of x is equal to y, that's what we need to show. However also, if you look at the range, the range is 0 to plus infinity because x squared is always positive or is equal to 0 for any real numbers. The range is equal to 0 to infinity and the co-domain is equal to R. I can clearly see that the range of this function is different from the co-domain of this function. Therefore I can straight say that this function is not an onto function or I can say that all negative numbers have no pre-images for example minus 1, minus 1 is in the co-domain however there is no elements such that x squared is equal to minus 1. Minus 1 has an opening is suffice to say minus 1 has no pre-image, minus 2 has no pre-image any numbers if even exists one element in R which has no pre-image in the co-domain then the function is not an onto function. It's easier to show that a function is not onto because you just find an element which has no pre-image. In this case we have all the elements, all the negative numbers here, because this is our co-domain and this is our domain. This is our range, range is just from zero to plus infinity, so all the elements, all negative numbers here have no pre-images. This function is not surjective function. Recap let's look at this, this function is injective because each element has got a unique image. It's not surjective because two has no pre-image or there is no arrow coming into this image 2. This function it's not injective because A and B have the same image, it is surjective because every element here has a pre-image. This is not surjective but not injective. If we look at this one, this one is injective because each element has got a unique image and also it's surjective because every element here has at least one per image, so it's both injective and surjective. Now, if I look at this function and this function is not injective because a and b has the same image, a is different from c but they have the same image so it's not injective. It's not surjective because four has no pre-image so it's not neither injective nor surjective. This function, however, this relation I'm even calling a function, this is not a function is not a valid function because a has two pre-images. To be a function every element in the domain has to have exactly one image, now this one is mapped to two elements therefore this is a relation but it's not a function. Because it's not a function, we cannot talk about if it is surjective or it's injective one-to-one on pole or wherever because it's not a function in the first place. What I've just talked about the two main properties of functions which is injective functions or injection and surjection or can say one-to-one and onto function, there are two main properties of this function. You can see here, the function f defined, let's look at these examples here. I've got a function f defined from R to R with f of x is equal to absolute value of x, so this function is neither injective nor surjective. Neither injective because minus 1 and 1 for example have the same image, have the same absolute value. It's not surjective because all negative numbers have no pre-images, that if I change the co-domain is the same function and I changed the co-domain to positive numbers, union 0 then this function is still not injective because f of minus 1 is equal to f of 1 is equal to 1 which they have the same image for example, and it is surjective because every elements in the domain our co-domain now is only positive real number and zero, so they all have at least one per image. Now if we change the domain to be R plus and zero which is a set of all positive real numbers including zero, then we change the co-domain back to R, this function now is injective because every two elements in the co-domain have the same image however it's not surjective because all negative numbers and R have no pre-images and if we change now the domain to be this set of real positive numbers and the co-domain is the same set of real positive numbers including zero, then this function is injective and it is surjective because we removed all negative numbers that were making if either not injective or not surjective and I can again comply with all those examples. I think this is a straight forward this one I want to the composition of a function and I just want to go to the inverse function. I'll go to the inverse function and after the inverse function we can talk, I can answer any question that you might have or any exercise you have a difficulty with. Let's look at we'll take about three minutes to look at this because we have already done the main work which is knowing when a function is injective or a function is surjective. Let's look at what do we mean with by a function is a bijective function or is an invertible function. Find the inverse function and graph the relationship between the graph of a function and its inverse function. I'll go, so function is said to be a bijective function or bijection or an invertible function if and only if it is both injective and surjective. We say that a function is a bijection or is an invertible function if and only if it is one-to-one and onto function. If it satisfied both injective and surjective property, then the function is said to be injective. I still look at this function here, so this function is a bijection, why? Because it is injective and also it's surjective. It is injective because every element here has got a unique pre-image. It is surjective because every element here has at least one pre-image so this function is a bijection or is a bijective function or is an invertible function. However this function g is not invertible because it is not bijection because it's not surjective. Although it is injective or it is one-to-one but it's not surjective because the value 2 has no pre-image. This function also is not bijection although it is surjective then you see every element has got a pre-image. However, it's not an injective because a and b has the same image therefore it is not an injective function therefore it can't be a bijective function because to be a bijective function it has to have to satisfy both property injective and surjective. Let's look at this example here we need to show that this function is a bijective or is an invertible function. I think we've already looked at this function and we already showed that this function from previous slides this function is an injective function. We're also already share that this function is the surjective function. We've already showed that this function is surjective function. Therefore this function is both injective and surjective then this function is by injection or is a bijective function or is an invertible function, so there are a lot of terms we use honest. I went quickly because I don't need to waste time on this because we've already looked those proofs previously. Now if a function is a bijective function or an invertible function then we can say that the inverse function exists, and we can notate adverse function by f to the power of minus 1, so that is the inverse function of the function f. Look here f is defined from A to B, the inverse function if it exists is defined from B to A, so we swap the domain and co-domain. Let's look at this function here again f of x is equal to x you can see the function f is defined from A to B, so f minus 1 this function is both injective and surjective than it is a bijection, then the inverse function is defined from B to A, and what it does the inverse is onto the effect of the function f, so the function f it doubles the input and the function f minus 1 a half the inputs, so f of 0 is 0, f minus 1 of 0 is 0/2 which is 0, f of 1 is 2, is 2 times 1 is 2, f minus 1 of 2 is 2/2 which is 1, f of 2 is 2 times 2 which is 4, f minus 1 of 4 is 4/2 which is 2, f of 2 is 2 times 3 which is 6, f minus 1 of 6 is 6/2 which is 3, f of 4 is 2 times 4 which is 8, f minus 1 of 8 is 8/2 which is 4. As you can see if we're apply f then apply f minus 1 we don't change anything. If I apply f then we apply f minus 1 to undo the effect of f than we stay in the same point we don't actually move. This is the function f is defined from R to R thus the domain verse the co-domain verse to x, f minus 1 is defined from, this is its domain and this is it's co-domain, so f minus 1 is x over 2, so if f doubles the input f minus 1 have it back, so f of 4 is 2 times 4 is 8, f minus 1 of 8 is 8/2 which is 4. We have already seen this function and we already showed that this function is an invertible. Let's now find the inverse function. To find the inverse function, we've already been shown that it is the injective, we've already been shown that it is surjective and here that is once you find that you find the value start from y is equal to f of x then you'll find x in terms of y so your inverse function is this. :09 This function is both injective and is both surjective we've already done the work for this, then we can say that f minus 1 is defined also from R to R in this case the domain and co-domain are the same and we just go to here and replace y by x because really this is f minus 1 of y then f minus 1 of x will be just x over 2 minus 2/3. One property that you can now is the composition of f and f minus 1, so f of f minus 1 of x is equal to f minus 1 of f of x is equal to x is the identity function. If you apply f then you apply f minus 1 you undo :11 what f did so therefore you stay in the same point so you get the identity function and we can go unexamined. I've got f of x is equal to x f minus 1 of x is x over 2 and if you look at f of f of minus x is f of f of minus x, if f of x over 2 is 2 times x over 2 which will be x same thing if you look at f minus 1 of f of x will be f minus 1 over f of x, will be f minus 1 to x, then which would be /2 which would be x so we just an example to show this property. One thing that you need to know, when you're plotting the inverse function, if you now the plot of the function than plotting the inverse function is easy so because the curve of f of x and f minus 1 of x are always symmetric with respect to the straight line y is equal to x. That is property the curve of f and f minus 1 are symmetric with respect to the straight line y is equal to x. :50 I think we've looked this function is not invertible because it's neither injective nor surjective this one is not invertible because it's not an injective function, this one is not invertible because it's not surjective function, this one is both invertible and :17 is both injective and surjective therefore it is a bijection with f of x is equal x squared and this function f is defined from R to R with f of x is equal plus 3, again when will look at this function is equal to. Let's look at those examples here, so that one is not a bijection because it's neither injective nor surjective, this one is not bijective function because it's not injective, and this one is not bijective function because it's not surjective, this one is bijective because it's both injective and surjective, this one also we have looked that is a bijective function because it's both injective and surjective and this one is not injective. Look here it will change the domain and co-domain to z than function is not surjective, it's still injective but it's not surjective, then it's not bijection. This is what we've looked at we looked at what is an invertible function or we looked invertible function has to be both injective and surjective, we looked at how to find the inverse function and we looked at the relationship between a graph of inverse functions. I think that's all I want to tell you about functions today. What I'll be doing now is I will stop the recording then I will start to answer any question that you might have. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 2.2 More about functions Lesson 2.3 Extra resources Video: Video Webinar on functions .

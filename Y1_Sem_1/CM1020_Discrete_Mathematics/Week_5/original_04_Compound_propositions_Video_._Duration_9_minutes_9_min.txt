Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key In this lecture we will introduce the concept of compound statements. We will look at the following types of logic operators, negation, conjunction, disjunction, and exclusive-or. We will also examine the truth tables for each of these logical operations. And finally, we will discuss the precedence of these logical operations. In the previous lectures we looked at some examples of simple propositions. Sometimes we want to build a compound proposition, which is a statement built by combining multiple propositions. Let's begin by looking at the first logic operator, negation. Let p be a proposition. The negation of p, denoted by not p, is the statement. It is not the case that p, the truth value of the negation of p, not p, is the opposite of the truth value of p. For instance, let's consider the following proposition p, John's program is written in Python. The negation of p, not p, is the proposition John's program is not written in Python. Now let's find its truth value using the truth table. As you can see, for each possible value of p, the truth value of not p is the opposite of the truth value of p. Now let's take a look at conjunction. Let p and q be propositions. The conjunction of p and q is the proposition p and q. The conjunction p and q is only true when p and q are both true and is false if this isn't the case, for instance, let's consider the following propositions p and q. P is the statement John's program is written in Python. Q is the statement John's program has less than 20 lines of code. Then p and q is the proposition John's program is written in Python and has less than 20 lines of code. The truth table for this conjunction shows us that p and q is only true if p and q are both true. Now let's move on to look at this junction. Let p and q be propositions. The disjunction of p and q is the proposition p or q. The disjunction p or q is only false when both p and q are false and is otherwise true. For instance, let's consider again the following propositions p and q. P is John's program is written in Python. Q is John's program has less than 20 lines of code. Then p or q is the proposition John's program is written in Python or has less than 20 lines of code. If we draw a truth table for this junction, we can see that p or q is only false when both p and q are false. Let's move on to look at the exclusive or logic operator. Let p and q be propositions. The exclusive-or of p and q denoted by p x or q is the proposition p or q, but not both. The exclusive-or p x or q is only true when p is true and q is false, and when p is false and q is true. For instance, let's consider again the following p and q. P is John's program is written in Python. Q is John's program has less than 20 lines of code. Then p, x or q is the proposition John's program is written in Python, or has less than 20 lines of code, but not both. When we draw the truth table for this logical operator, we can see all its possible truth values. Propositions can be combined to build complex compound propositions. To do this, we need to start using parentheses. The meaning of propositions is different depending on the order in which the parentheses are used. For instance, the proposition p or q and not r is different from p or q and not r. In order to reduce the number of parentheses, we can use an order of precedents. For instance, using the order of precedence, the proposition p or q and not r can be written simply as p or q and not r. Now let's work through an exercise that brings together everything you have learned in this lecture. Given a positive integer n, let's consider the following propositions p and q. P is n is an even number, q is n is less than 10, let's write the logical expression for each of the following propositions. The first proposition is n is an even number and is less than 10, which can be expressed as p and q. The second proposition is n is either an even number or is less than 10, which can be expressed as p or q. The third proposition is n is either an even number or is less than 10, but not both, which can be expressed as p, x, or q. Now let's evaluate the truth values of these propositions using a truth table. We start by building all the possible combinations of p and q in the first two columns. Then we create a third column in which we list the truth values. For the first proposition, n is an even number and is less than 10, which can be expressed as p and q. Then we do the same for the second proposition. N is either an even number or is less than 10, which can be expressed as p or q. Now let's evaluate the third proposition. N is either an even number or is less than 10, but not both, which can be expressed as p, x, or q. In this lecture we have introduced compound propositions that involved the following logical negation conjunction, disjunction, and exclusive-or. And finally, we looked at the order of precedence of these logical operations. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Video: Video Introduction to propositional logic .

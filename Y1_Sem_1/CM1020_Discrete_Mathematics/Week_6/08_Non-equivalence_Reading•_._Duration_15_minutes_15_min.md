Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences:

To prove that two propositions are equivalent, it suffices to build the truth table for each proposition. If the truth values of the two propositions are the same, then they are equivalent. However, if there is a case where the truth values differ, then the propositions are not equivalent. The truth table for p → q, ¬p → ¬q, and q → p shows that p → q and q → p are not equivalent because their columns have different truth values.

On the other hand, the truth table for q → p and ¬p → ¬q shows that these two propositions are equivalent because their columns have identical truth values. The truth value of a proposition is determined by its definition and the rules of propositional logic.

In general, a proposition p → q is true if and only if either p is false or q is true. This means that if p is true and q is false, then p → q is false. The truth table for p → q shows that this condition holds.

Similarly, ¬p → ¬q is true if and only if either ¬p is false or ¬q is true. This means that if ¬p is true (i.e., p is false) and ¬q is true (i.e., q is false), then ¬p → ¬q is true. The truth table for ¬p → ¬q shows that this condition holds.

In conclusion, the equivalence of two propositions can be determined by building their truth tables and comparing their columns. If the columns are identical, then the propositions are equivalent. If the columns have different truth values, then the propositions are not equivalent.

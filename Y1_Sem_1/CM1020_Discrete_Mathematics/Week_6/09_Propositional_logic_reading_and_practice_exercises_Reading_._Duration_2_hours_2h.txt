Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

The provided text is not actually about propositional logic, but rather provides instructions on how to consolidate understanding and practice exercises related to this topic. To consolidate understanding, students should read pages on logical implication, converse, contrapositive and inverse, equivalence, the laws of propositional logic (including De Morgan's laws), and the precedence of logical operators from Rosen (2012). After reading, students should attempt exercises from Rosen, including 22-23, 10-14, 32-37, and 9-34. Similarly, students should read pages on logical implication from Koshy (2004) and attempt exercises p.19, 54-56, 3-7, 11, and 35-37. Students can also review solutions to odd-numbered exercises in the back of the book.

Additionally, students can further practice propositional logic by reading pages from Levin (2019) pp.6-15 and 198-202.

Overall, the instructions emphasize the importance of practicing exercises and reviewing material to solidify understanding of propositional logic concepts.

There are no specific formulae or technical details mentioned in the text, as it appears to be a general instruction guide rather than a mathematical proof or research paper.

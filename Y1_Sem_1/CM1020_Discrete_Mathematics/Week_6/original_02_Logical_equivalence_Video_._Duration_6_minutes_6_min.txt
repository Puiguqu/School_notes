Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key In this lecture, we will discuss logical equivalence. First, we will define the equivalence logical operator and examine some of its properties. Then we will show how to prove that two propositions are equivalent using a truth table. Finally, we will update the table of precedence by including implication and equivalence. In the last lecture, we explained what is meant by logical implication. Now, we will define and investigate logical equivalence. Let's p and q be propositions. The biconditional or equivalent statement, p equivalent to q is the proposition p implies q and q implies p. Biconditional statements are also called bi-implications and can also be expressed as p if and only if q as shown in the truth table of equivalence. The biconditional statement p equivalent to q is true when p and q have the same truth values and is false if this isn't the case. Now, let's examine the concept of equivalent propositions, which is slightly different from equivalent statements. Let's p and q be propositions, p and q are logically equivalent if they always have the same truth value. We'll write p equivalent to q. Let's note that the symbol equivalent is not a logical operator. P equivalent to q is not a compound proposition, but rather is the statement that p equivalent to q is always true. One way in which to determine equivalence is to use truth tables and check whether the two propositions have the same truth values. For the instance, let's compare the two propositions, p implies q and non p or q. Let's begin by building the truth table for p implies q. Then let's add the truth values for non p or q. The truth table shows us that non p or q is equivalent to p implies q as they have the same truth values. In order to determine non-equivalence, we can use truth tables and find at least one row where the values differ. For instance, let's examine whether the converse or the inverse of an implication is equivalent to the original implication. Let's begin by building the true table for not p implies not q. Then let's add truth values for q implies p. The truth table shows that the converse and inverse propositions are different from p implies q as they have different truth values in the second and third rows. Now, let's look at an example to illustrate what you have learned so far in this lecture. Let's p, q, and r be the following propositions concerning unknown integer n, p is the proposition, n is equal to 20, q is proposition n is even, and r is preposition n is positive. Let's express each of the following conditional statements symbolically. If n equals 20, then n is positive, can be expressed as p implies r. N equals 20, if n is even, can be expressed as q implies p. N equals 20, only if n is even, can be expressed as p implies q. We have already looked at the precedence order of compound propositions, conjunction, disjunction, and negation. We have seen how it is used to simplify complex compound propositions. Now that we have explored logical implication and logical equivalence, let's update the table to show the precedence order of compound propositions, including implication and equivalence. In this lecture, we have discussed logical equivalence. First, we defined equivalence and explored some of its properties. Then we showed how we can use truth tables to prove that two propositions are equivalent. Finally, we discussed the precedence of implication and equivalence in relation to the other logical operators seen in the previous lecture, negation, conjunction, and disjunction. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 3.2 Applications Discussion Prompt: Propositions and computer logic .

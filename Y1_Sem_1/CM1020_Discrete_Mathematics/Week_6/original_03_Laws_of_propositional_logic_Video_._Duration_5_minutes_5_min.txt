First, we'll introduce and discuss some important laws of propositional logic including DeMorgan's laws. Then, we will show how these laws are used in practice to build a reasoning and prove equivalence. We said at the beginning of the topic that propositional logic is an algebra involving multiple laws. Let's take a look at some of the most important of them. Idempotent laws which means that p or p is equivalent to p and p and p is equivalent to p. Commutative laws which mean that p or q is equivalent to q or p and p and q is equivalent to q and p. Associative laws, which mean that the conjunction and disjunction operators can validly be distributed over one another. Distributive laws which mean that the order in which the operators are performed doesn't matter as long as they're sequence remains the same. Identity laws which mean that p or false is equivalent to p and p and true is equivalent to p. Finally, domination laws which mean that p or true is always equivalent to true and p and false is always equivalent to false. Now, let's prove a case of Distributive Law of disjunction over conjunction. Take the following two compound propositions, p or q and r, and p or q and p or r. By constructing the true table for this compound propositions, we can see that they are logically equivalent. Now, let's explore some other important equivalences. DeMorgan's laws are very useful. They formalize how we negate conjunction and disjunction. The basic idea behind this law is to ensure that we change the logical connective after we negate. For instance, the negation of this junction is formed by taking the conjunction of the negation of the component's propositions. Other laws can be useful for simplifying compound propositions such as the Absorption laws where p or p and q is equivalent to p, and p and p or q is equivalent to p, The negation laws tell us that p or not p is always true which is known as tautology and p and not p is always false. Finally, the Double Negation law tells us that not not p is equivalent to p. Now, let's see how we can use the laws that we have seen so far to build an equivalence proof. For instance, let's examine the equivalence between those two compound propositions. The given proposition is not p and not p or q. Using DeMorgan's laws, we have not p or not not p or q. Using DeMorgan's laws again, we have not p or not not p and not q. Using the double negation law, we have not p or p and not q. Using the distributive laws, we have not p or p and not p or not q. Using the compliment laws, we have true and not p or not q. Finally, using the identity law, we arrive at not p or not q which means that these two propositions are equivalent. In this lecture, we looked at a number of propositional logic loss. First, we introduced and explored some important laws of propositional logic including DeMorgan's laws. Then we saw how these laws are used in practice to simplify complex expressions and prove that two propositions are equivalent. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 3.2 Applications Discussion Prompt: Propositions and computer logic .

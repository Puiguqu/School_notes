Introduction Propositional logic, also known as propositional calculus or statement logic, is a branch of logic that deals with propositions and their relationships. Propositions are statements that can be either true or false but not both. Propositional logic is fundamental in mathematics and computer science. Here are the key elements you need to understand and take from this topic. Basic concepts Definition 1. A proposition is a declarative sentence that is either true or false, but not both. Examples: 'It is raining' (can be true or false). Logical connectives Negation (¬): The negation of a proposition p is ¬p, which is true if p is false and false if p is true. Conjunction (∧): The conjunction of propositions p and q is p∧q, which is true if both p and q are true. Disjunction (∨): The disjunction of propositions p and q is p∨q, which is true if at least one of p or q is true. Implication (→): The implication p→q is true if p is false or q is true (it is false only if p is true and q is false). Biconditional (↔): The biconditional p↔q is true if p and q are both true or both false. Truth tables Truth tables are used to determine the truth value of complex propositions based on the truth values of their components.

Some common logical equivalences include: Identity laws p∨False≡p p∧True≡p Domination laws p∨True≡True p∧False≡False Idempotent laws p∨p≡p p∧p≡p Double negation law ¬(¬p)≡p Commutative laws p∨q≡q∨p p∧q≡q∧p Associative laws (p∨q)∨r≡p∨(q∨r) (p∧q)∧r≡p∧(q∧r) Distributive laws p∨(q∧r)≡(p∨q)∧(p∨r) p∧(q∨r)≡(p∧q)∨(p∧r) De Morgan's laws ¬(p∨q)≡¬p∧¬q ¬(p∧q)≡¬p∨¬q Converse, inverse and contrapositive Consider a conditional proposition p→q. The converse of p→q is q→p. The inverse of p→q is ¬p→¬q. The contrapositive of p→q is ¬q→¬p. Practice exercise Construct the truth table for (p∧q)∨¬r. Determine if the following propositions are logically equivalent: ¬(p∧q) and ¬p∨¬q. Prove the logical equivalence: (p∨q)∧(p∨¬q)≡p. Translate the following statements into propositional logic: 'If it rains, then the ground is wet.' 'The ground is wet and it is not raining.' Solution to practice exercise 1.

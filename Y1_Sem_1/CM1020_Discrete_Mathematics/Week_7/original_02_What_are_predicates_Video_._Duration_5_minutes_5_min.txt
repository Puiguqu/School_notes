Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key In this lecture, we will begin by looking at some examples of statements that can't be described using propositional logic. We will then introduce predicate logic as a solution to solve this problem. To get a clear picture of the role of predicate logic, let's consider again the second example from the previous lesson. Consider the statement x squared is equal to 4. We saw earlier that this type of statement is not a proposition, as its truth value is a function depending on x. Therefore, this can't be expressed using propositional logic. As discussed in the introduction, all these types of statements can be formally described using predicate logic. Let's begin by defining a predicate. Predicates are generalizations of propositions. They are functions that return a true or false value depending on their variables. Predicates become propositions when their valuables are given actual values. Let's have a look at the previous statement, x squared is equal to 4. This statement contains two parts; the variable x, which is the subject of the statement, the predicate squared is equal to four, which is the property that the subjects of the statement can have. The statement can be formalized as P of x, where P is the predicate squared is equal to four and x is the variable. P is set to be the propositional function. Once a value is assigned to the variable x, the statement P of x becomes a proposition and has a truth value. Let's consider again the same example. Let P be the propositional function squared is equal to four. Let's evaluate P of x for specific values of the variable x. P of 2 is true, P of 3 is false. In the previous example, we saw a predicate with a single parameter. A predicates can also have multiple parameters. For example, consider the following predicate P of x and y, which denotes x square is greater than y. This predicate is a two parameter predicates. P of minus 2, 3 is equivalent to 4 is greater than 3, which is a true statement. Whereas, P of 2 and 4 is equivalent to 2 to the power of 2 is greater than 4, which is a false statement. Let's now look at another example of a predicate with multiple parameters. Let the predicate Q of x, y, and z denote x plus y is less than z. Q of 2, 4, 5 is equivalent to 6 is less than 5, and this is a false proposition. Q of 1, 3, 7 is equivalent to 4 is less than 7. This is a true proposition. Q of 1, 3, z, which is 4 is less than z, and this is not a proposition. The logical operations from propositional logic that you learned about in the last topic can be carried over to predicate logic. For instance, if P of x denotes x_2 is less than 16, then P of 1 or P of minus 5 is equivalent to 1 is less than 16 or 25 is less than 16, which is equivalent to true or false, which is equivalent to true. P of 1 and p of minus 5 is equivalent to true and false, which is equivalent to false. P of 3 and P of y is not a proposition, and it becomes a proposition when y is assigned a value. In this lecture, we began by considering the limitations of propositional logic. Then, we defined predicate logic as a solution to these limitations and showed that propositional logic operations can also apply to predicate logic. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Video: Video Introduction to predicate logic .

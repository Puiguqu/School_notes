Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key In this lecture, we will introduce the concept of quantifiers in predicate logic. Then we will discuss in more detail three quantifiers: universal, existential, and uniqueness quantifiers. Quantification expresses the extent to which a predicate is true over a range of elements. They express the meaning of the words all and some. The two most important quantifiers are the universal quantifier and the existential quantifier. For instance, in natural language, the following statement express quantified predicates, all men are mortal. Some computers are not connected to the network. There is a third quantifier called the uniqueness quantifier. We will explore these three quantifiers in more detail during this lecture. Let's begin with the universal quantifier. The universal quantification of a predicate P of x is the proposition P of x is true for all values of x in the universe of discourse. We use the notation for all x P of x. If the universe of discourse is finite, say, n_1, n_2 to n_k, then the universal quantifier is simply the conjunction of the propositions over all the elements. Let's look at how the universal quantifier works in practice. Consider the following predicate logic: P of x and Q of x in which the universe of discourse for both P of x and Q of x is all university students. P of x denote x must take a discrete mathematics course. Q of x denotes x is a computer science student. Let's express the following statements in terms of P of x and Q of x. The first statement is, every computer science students must take a discrete mathematics course. The second statement is, every computer science student must take a discrete mathematics course or be a computer science student. The third statement is, everybody must take a discrete mathematics course and be a computer science student. Let's now try to express the following statements using the universal quantifier. For every x and every y, x plus y is greater than 10. To do this, we first need to define a two-parameter predicate P as follows: P of x and y denote x plus y is greater than 10, where the universe of discourse for the variables x and y is the set of integers. Then we can rewrite this statement using the universal quantifier as follows, for all x, for all y, P of x, y. Now, let's move on to look at the existential quantifier. The existential quantification of a predicate P of x is the proposition, there exists a value x in the universe of discourse such that P of x is true. We will use the notation, there exists x P of x. If the universe of discourse is finite, say, n_1, n_2 to n_k, then the existential quantification is simply the disjunction of the propositions over all the elements. Now, let's take a look at how the existential quantifier works in practice. For example, let P of x and y denote the statement x plus y is equal to 5. The expression E written as, there exists x and there exists y, where P of x, y can be read as follows: There exists a value x and a value y in the universe of discourse such that x plus y equal 5 is true. For instance, if the universe of discourse is positive integers, E is true. If the universe of discourse is negative integers, E is false. Let's have a look at another example involving second degree equations. Let a, b, c denote fixed real numbers, and let S be the statement. There exists a real solution to the equation ax_2 plus bx minus c is equal 0. The statement S can be expressed as, there exists a unique x, P of x, where P of x is ax squared plus bx minus c is equal to 0, and the universe of discourse for x is the set of real numbers. Now, let's evaluate the truth value of the statement S. When b squared is greater than or equal to 4ac, S is true as this is a second degree equation that has two solutions. P of minus b plus or minus the square root of b squared minus 4ac divided by 2a is equal to 0. However, when b squared is less than 4ac, S is false as there is no real number x that can satisfy the predicate. Let's move on to look at a different quantifier, the uniqueness quantifier, which is a special case of the existential quantifier. The uniqueness quantification of a predicate P of x is the proposition: There exists a unique value of x in the universe of discourse such that P of x is true. We use the notation, there exists a unique x P of x. Now, let's take a look at how the uniqueness quantifier works in practice. For example, let's P of x denote the statement x squared is equal to 4. The expression E can be expressed as, there exists a unique x P of x, which means there exists a unique value x in the universe of discourse, such that x squared is equal to 4 is true. For instance, if the universe of discourse is positive integers, E is true, as two is the unique solution. If the universe of discourse is integers, E is false, as two and minus two are both solutions. In this lecture, we began by defining the concept of quantifiers in predicate logic. Then we examined three main quantifiers: universal, existential, and the uniqueness quantifier, and saw how they work in practice. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Video: Video Introduction to predicate logic .

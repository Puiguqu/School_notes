Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key In this lecture, we will look at the properties of nested quantifiers. We will introduce nested quantifiers, binding variables and logical operators. Finally, we'll discuss the order of operators and the precedence of quantifiers. In order to express statements with multiple variables, we use nested quantifiers. Let's take a look at the meaning of some nested quantifiers. For all x, for all y, P(x, y) means that P(x, y) is true for every pair x, y. There exists x, there exists y, P(x,y) means that there is a pair x,y for which P(x,y) is true. For all x there exists y, P(x,y) means that for every x there is a y for which P(x,y) is true. There exists x for all y, P(x,y) means that there is an x for which P(x,y) is true for every y. The variables of a predicate can either be bound or free. A variable is said to be bound if it is within the scope of a quantifier. A variable is said to be free if it is not bound by quantifier or particular value. For instance, let P be a propositional function, and S the statement there exists x P(x,y). We can say that x is bound and y is free. The Logical operations that were introduced in the previous topic on propositional logic negation, disjunction, conjunction, implication, and equivalence can also be applied to quantified statements. For example, if P(x) denotes x is greater than 3, and Q(x) the notes x squared is even, then there exists x, P(x) and Q(x) is equivalent to true. Because for example, x = 4 verify this condition for all x P(x) implies Q(x) is equivalent to false. Because for example x = 5 doesn't verify this condition. When nested quantifiers are of the same type the order doesn't matter. However, the order doesn't matter if the quantifiers are of different types. For example for all x, for all y, P(x,y) is equivalent to for all y, for all x P(x, y). There exists x, there exists y, P(x,y) is equivalent to there exists y, there exists x, P(x,y). However, for all x, there exists y, P(x,y) is different from there exists y for all x, P(x,y). In order to simplify the notation of nested quantifiers ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Video: Video Introduction to predicate logic .

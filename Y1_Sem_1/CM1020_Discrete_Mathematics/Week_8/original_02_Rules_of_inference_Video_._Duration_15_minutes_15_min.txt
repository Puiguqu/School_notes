Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key In this lecture, we will talk about the rules of inference. We will begin by introducing the concept of valid arguments. Then we will discuss in more detail some of the widely used rules of inference. Then we will explain how to build a valid arguments. Finally, we will show some examples of formal fallacies. An argument in proposition all logic is a sequence of propositions. The final proposition is called the conclusion and the other propositions in the arguments are called premises or hypotheses. An argument is valid if the truth of all its premises implies the truth of the conclusion. Let's consider the following argument. The first premise is if you have access to the internet, you can order a book on machine learning. The second premise is you have access to the internet, therefore you can order a book on machine learning. This argument is valid because whenever all its premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. Let's consider another argument. The first premise is if you have access to the internet, you can order a book on machine learning. The second premise is you can order a book on machine learning, therefore you have access to the internet. This argument is not valid because we can imagine situations where the premises are true and the conclusion is false. Now, let's talk about rules of inference. The rules of inference can be seen as building blocks in construction, incrementally complex valid arguments. We can use a truth table to determine whether an argument is true or false, but this can be very laborious, especially with multiple variables. For instance, when an argument includes eight different proposition variables, we need to build a truth table of two to the power of eight different roles, which is a total of 250 six rows. By contrast, rules of inference provide a much simpler way of proving the validity of an argument. Also, every rule of inference can be proved using a tautology. The tautology shown here is the basis of the rule of inference called modus ponens. This tautology leads to the following valid argument form which we have already used in one of the previous examples. If the conditional statement p implies q is true and the hypothesis piece too, then the conclusion q is also true. Let's see an example of how this works. Let p be the proposition it is snowing and q the proposition. I will study discrete mathematics. If the hypothesis, if it is snowing, I will study discrete mathematics is true and if the hypothesis it is snowing, it is also true. We can conclude that I will study discrete mathematics. The tautology shown here is the basis of the rule of inference called motives, tollens. This tautology leads to the following valid argument for if the hypothesis not q is true and if the conditional statement p implies q is true, the conclusion not p is also true. Let's see an example of how this works. Let's be be the proposition it is snowing and cue the proposition I will study discrete mathematics. If the hypothesis if it is snowing, I will study discrete mathematics is true. And if the hypothesis I will not study discrete mathematics is true, we can conclude that it is not snowing. The tautology shown here is the basis of the rule of inference called conjunction. This tautology leads to the following valid argument for. If the hypothesis p is true and if the hypothesis q is true, the conclusion p and q is also true. Let's see an example of how this works. Let's p be the proposition I will study programming and q the proposition I will study discrete mathematics. If the hypothesis I will study programming is true and if the hypothesis I will study discrete mathematics is also true. We can conclude that I will study programming and discrete mathematics is also true. Tautology shown here is the basis of the rule of inference called simplification. This tautology leads to the following valid arguments for if the hypothesis p and q is true. The conclusion p is also true. Let's see an example of how this works. Let me be the proposition. I will study discrete mathematics and q the proposition I will study programming. If the hypothesis, I will study discrete mathematics and programming is true. We can conclude that I will study discrete mathematics is also true. The tautology shown here is the basis of the rule of inference called addition. This tautology leads to the following valid argument for if the hypothesis p is true the conclusion p or q is also true. Let's see an example of how this works. Let's q be the proposition I will visit paris and cue the proposition I will study discrete mathematics. If the hypothesis I will visit Paris is true, we can conclude that I will visit Paris or I will study discrete mathematics is also true. The tautology shown here is the basis of the rule of inference called hypothetical syllogism. This tautology leads to the following valid argument for if the hypothesis p implies q is true and the hypothesis q implies art is true. The conclusion p implies r is also true. Let's see an example of how this works. Let's be be the proposition it is snowing. And q the proposition I will study discrete mathematics. And are the proposition I will pass the quizzes. If the hypothesis, if it is snowing, I will study discrete mathematics is true. And if the hypothesis, if I study discrete mathematics, I will pass the quiz is also true, we can conclude that if it is knowing I would pass the quizzes. The tautology shown here is the basis of the rule of inference called disjunctive syllogism. This tautology leads to the following valid arguments. If the hypothesis p or q is true and the hypothesis not p is true the conclusion q is also true. Let's see an example of how this works, let p be the proposition. I will study discrete mathematics and q the proposition I will study art. If the hypothesis I will study discrete mathematics or I will study art is true. And if the hypothesis I will not study discrete mathematics is true, we can conclude that I will study art is true. The tautology shown here is the basis of the rule of inference called resolution. This tautology leads to the following valid argument for. If the hypothesis p or q is true and the hypothesis not p or r is true, the conclusion q or r is also true. Let's see an example of how this works. Let p be the proposition. It is raining and q the proposition it is snowing and r proposition it is cold. If the hypothesis it is raining or it is snowing is true and if the hypothesis it is not raining or it is cold is true, we can conclude that it is snowing or it is cold. In order to build a valid argument, there are a few steps that we need to follow. If it is initially written in English, transform the statement into an argument form by choosing a variable for each simple proposition. Start with the hypothesis of the argument. Then build a sequence of steps in which each step follows from the previous step by applying rules of influence and laws of logic. The final step of the argument is the conclusion. Now, let's use what you have learned so far to build a valid argument from the following premises. The first premise, is the proposition. It is not cold tonight. The second premise is the proposition. We will go to the theater only if it is cold. The third premise is the proposition. If we do not go to the theater, we will watch a movie at home. The fourth premise is the proposition. If you watch a movie at home, we will need to make popcorn. First let's define the proposition variables p,q,r and s. As follows p is the proposition, it is cold tonight. Q is the proposition we will go to the theater, r is the proposition we will watch a movie at home, as is the proposition. We will need to make popcorn, then we will need to formalize our premises using the proposition of variables we just defined. Now let's build a valid argument from the given hypothesis. Step three is the result of modest talents inference from hypothesis one and two. Step five is the result of modest opponents inference from steps three and 4. The step seven is the result of modest opponents from the steps five and 6. Therefore, the conclusion of the argument is we will need to make popcorn. Fallacy is the use of an incorrect argument. When reasoning, formal fallacies can be expressed in propositions of logic and proved to be incorrect. Some of the widely used formal forces are affirming the consequence, a conclusion that denies premises. Contradictory premises denying the antecedent existential fallacy and exclusive premises. Let's take a look at an example of one of these fallacies by considering the following arguments. If you have internet access, you can order this book. The second premise is you can order this book. The conclusion is you have internet access. This argument can be formalized us if p implies q and q is true, then p is also true where p Ii the proposition you have internet access and q is the proposition you can order this book. Proposition p implies q and q implies p is not a tautology because it is false when p is false and q is true. This is an incorrect argument using the fallacy of affirming the consequence or conclusion. In this lecture, we talked about rules of inference. We began by introducing the concept of valid arguments. Then we discussed in more detail some of the widely used rules of inference and explained how to build a valid arguments. Finally, we listed some formal fallacies and looked at an example of one of them. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 4.2 Applications Video: Video De Morgan's laws for quantifiers .

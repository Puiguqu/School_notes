In this lesson I will give a summary of the first five topics and what you need to revise to prepare for the midterm assessment. As you already know, the grade for the midterm assessment is worth 30% of the overall grade. The midterm assessment cover the following five topics, set theory, functions, propositional logic, predicate logic, and Boolean algebra. The first topic covered in the midterm assessment is set theory. I will now give you a summary of this topic. The first things you need to know is how sets are represented. We have covered different ways of representing sets, the listing methods, the set builder notation methods, and how Venn diagram is used to represent a set. Another concept we looked at is a membership table. You need to know how to build a membership table for a given set. You need to be familiar with the set notation and terminologies such as element of a set, the cardinality of a set, a subset of a set, and a powerset of a set. In addition to this, you need to understand the set operations such as union, intersection, difference, the symmetric difference, and their combinations. Finally, you need to be able to prove properties and relationships between sets such as the equivalence of two given sets. This can be done in three different ways. The first one is using the laws of set operation such as commutativity, distributivity, or associativity. The second method is using the membership table. And the third and final method requires using Venn diagram. One of the common mistakes is using an example to prove correctness of a general statement. Don't give an example to prove that a general statement is correct. The proof can be achieved by using the laws of set operations, membership tables, or Venn diagrams. If a statement is incorrect in this case you can give a counterexample to show that this statement is incorrect. Here is an example where a and b are two given sets and we are asked to prove or disapprove the following two statements. The first one is a powerset of A intersection B is a subset of a powerset of A intersection the powerset of B. The second one is the power set of a union b is equal to the power set of a union, the power set of b. The first statement powerset of A intersection B is a subset of a powerset of A intersection powerset of B is True. Let's now prove the correctness of this statement. To do this, we need to show that if a set X is an element of the power set of a intersection B, then X is also an element of a power set of a intersection power set of B. Let X be an element of a powerset of A intersection B. By definition of the power set X is then a subset of a intersection. B means that X is a subset of a and X is a subset of b, which means that X is an element of a power set of a and is also an element of a power set of bhiddeen. Hence, X is an element of a powerset of A intersection powerset of B, and this ends the proof. The second statement powerset of A union B is equal to the powerset of A union the powerset of B is False. In this case, it suffices to give a counterexample to show that this statement is incorrect. Let a be a set containing one element which is one b, a set containing one element which is two. So a union b is a set containing two elements which are one and two. In this case, the powersets of AB, A union B, and the powerset of A union of powerset of B are given as follows. The power set of a is a set containing two elements. One of its elements is the empty set, the other one is the element containing one. The power set of b is a set containing two elements, the empty set and a set containing two. A power set of a union b is a set containing four elements, the empty set set with one element, one set with one element two, and a set containing one and two. The power set of a union the power set of B contains three elements, the empty set set containing one and the set containing two. We can clearly see that the power set of a union, the power set of B is different from the power set of a union b, as the set containing one and two is an element of the power set of a union b. But it's not an element of a powerset of A union the powerset of B. So this ends the proof. The second topic covered in the midterm assessment is functions. I will now give you a summary of this topic. You need to know what the following are, the domain of a function, the co-domain of a function, and the range of a function. You need to understand properties of functions. We looked at three one to one onto and Bayes active functions. You need to understand these properties and be able to show if a given function satisfies each of these properties. You also need to know how to work out the inverse functions if one exists. The third topic covered in the midterm assessments is propositional logic. You need to understand the definition of a proposition, compound propositions using or, and, not, the symmetric difference, and implication and equivalence of propositions. You also need to know how to build the truth table and the truth sets for a particular compound proposition. We have covered different laws of propositional logic, such as, idempotent law, commutative law, associative law, distributive law, identity laws, and domination laws. You are required to understand all of them and be able to apply them to simplify a compound propositional logic expression. We have also looked at De Morgan's laws given two propositions, p and q. The first De Morgan's law states that the negation of p or q is equivalent to the negation of p and the negation of q. The second statement of de Morgan's theorem states that the negation of p and q is equivalent to the negation of p or the negation of q. You need to be able to understand these laws and be able to apply them to simplify a given Boolean expression. You are also required to understand how to work out the converse, the inverse, and the contrapositive of a given logical implication statement. Let p and q be two propositions. The proposition q implies p is the converse of p implies q. The proposition not q implies not p is the contrapositive of p implies q. The proposition not p implies not q is the inverse of p implies q. We now move to the fourth topic, which is about predicate logic. The first things you need to understand is the difference between a predicate and a proposition. You need to be able to understand predicate logic operations and be able to apply them. Logical operations discussed, a propositional logic, such as not, and, or, implication and equivalence, can also be applied to quantified statement. The third concept we have covered in this topic is quantifiers. We have talked about three the universal quantifier, the existential and the uniqueness quantifier. You also need to understand the concept of nested quantifiers. Two quantifiers are nested if one is within the scope of the other. You need to be able to write the negation of quantifiers and nested quantifiers. You are required to understand the rules of inference such as Modus ponens, Modus tollens, conjunctions, and disjunctive syllogism, and so on. Rules of inference can be seen as building blocks in constructing incrementally more complex valid arguments from existing ones. Finally, you need to understand how to combine rules of inference for propositions and quantified statements to prove a valid argument. The fifth and final topic included in the midterm assessments is Boolean algebra. I will now explain what you will take from this topic. You need to understand the laws of Boolean algebra and be able to apply them to simplify a Boolean expression. You need to be able to understand the building blocks, the logic gates used to build a logic network. You also need to be able to convert a Boolean expression to its corresponding logical circuits, and vice versa. Finally, you need to know how Karnaugh map is used to simplify Boolean expressions for a given logical network. I hope this will help you prepare for your midterm assessment. If you have any questions regarding this, please post them to the forum or ask your online tutor. Finally, I wish you all the best with your ongoing studies. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Video: Video Midterm preparation .

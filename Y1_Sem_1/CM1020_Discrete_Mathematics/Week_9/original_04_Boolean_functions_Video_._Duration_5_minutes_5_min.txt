Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key In this lecture, we will introduce and explore Boolean functions. We will start by giving a definition of a Boolean function, then we will look at the algebraic and standardized forms of Boolean function. Finally, we will consider some useful Boolean functions. A Boolean function defines a mapping from one or multiple Boolean input values to a Boolean output value. For n Boolean input values, there are 2_n possible combinations. For example, given a function f with three inputs, x, y, and z. F of x, y, z can be completely defined with, 2_3 rows truth table, as shown in this example. There is only one way to represent a Boolean function in a truth table. However, in algebraic form, a function can be expressed in variety of ways. For example, f of x equals x plus x prime y and f of x equals x plus y are both algebraic representations of the same truth table. The two most common standardized forms are the sum of products form, and the product of sums form. In the sum of products form, valuables built using the and operator, are summed together using the or operator, such as, f of x, y, z equals xy plus xz plus yz. In the products of sums form, valuables built using the or operator are multiplied together using the and operator, such as, f of x, y, z equals x plus y multiplied by, x plus z multiplied by, y plus z. The sum of products form is easier to use them to simplify. So we will be using this form from this point on wards. The sum of products form for function can be built using the function truth table as follows. First, we focus on the values of the variable that make the output of the function, equal to one. Then, if an input equals 1, it appears uncomplemented in the expression and stays as it is. If an input equals 0, it appeals complemented in the expression, and its corresponding compliment is used. The function f is then expressed as the sum of products of all the terms for which f equals 1. For example, given the truth table shown here of the Boolean function f of xy, using the steps just described, we can deduce that f can be expressed as f of x, y equals x prime y plus xy prime plus xy. Now, let's take a look at two useful functions. The first of these two is the exclusive or function expressed as, x or y. This function is defined as true if either x or y is true, but not both. It is represented by the following truth table, and it can be expressed as x or y equals x prime y plus xy prime. The second useful function is the implies function, expressed as x implies y. This function is defined as, if x then y. It is represented by the following truth table, and it can be expressed as x implies y equals x prime plus y. In this lecture, we introduced and explored the notion of Boolean functions. We begun by giving a definition of a Boolean function, then we discussed the algebraic and standardized formed of a Boolean function. Finally, we looked at two useful Boolean functions. The exclusive or function, and the implies function. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Video: Video Midterm preparation .

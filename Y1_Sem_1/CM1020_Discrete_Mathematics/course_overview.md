### Introduction to discrete mathematics Video• . Duration: 4 minutes 4 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Discrete mathematics is a branch of mathematics that deals with discrete or distinct objects rather than continuous objects. It studies structures and algorithms used to represent and manipulate discrete objects. Discrete objects are separated or distinct from each other, such as integers or rational numbers. Discrete mathematics has many applications in computer science, including programming languages, software development, cryptography, and algorithms.

Graph theory is one of the main areas of study in discrete mathematics, used to model and analyze networks such as social networks, transportation networks, and communication networks. Boolean algebra studies logical operations such as AND, OR, and NOT, and their application in computer circuits. It is an important foundation for studying computer science and has many applications.

Data structures are used to store and manipulate data efficiently and effectively, and they are a crucial aspect of computer science. Discrete mathematics is used to design and analyze data structures and study the complexity of algorithms that manipulate them. The module covers 10 topics over 20 weeks, with two weeks per topic.

The assessment consists of three elements: 10 summative quizzes (20% of final grade), a midterm assignment (30% of final grade), and a final exam (50% of final grade). By studying the module, students gain a mathematical understanding of discrete mathematics topics that improve their skills in thinking abstractly. The course includes a video introduction to discrete mathematics, readings on the syllabus and getting started, and a careers video.

The discussion prompt asks students what they know about sets, which is an important concept in discrete mathematics. Set theory is introduced in Lesson 1.1, covering topics such as union, intersection, and complement of sets. The module is designed to improve reasoning and problem-solving capabilities, making it an essential field of study for computer science and other fields.

Overall, the course aims to provide students with a mathematical understanding of discrete mathematics topics that will support their studies in computer science.

### Careers video Video• . Duration: 3 minutes 3 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Liz Wilkinson, a Careers Consultant at the University of London, welcomes participants to the career development stage. She emphasizes that career development can mean different things for different people, such as climbing the ladder or specialization. After 35 years of work, she has experienced various career development phases and encourages participants to consider their own qualities. The experience gained from studying at the University of London is a significant factor in career development.

Participants may feel uncertain about acquiring new skills, understanding the sector, or networking. Liz suggests starting with self-reflection exercises, such as identifying one's strengths and weaknesses. She references Edwin's point on impostor syndrome, which highlights the importance of self-convincing oneself.

Liedtka's three elements of strategic thinking are discussed: (1) system's perspective, (2) intent focus, and (3) keeping the vision in front of one. A strategic manager at the University of London illustrates this by emphasizing the need to "keep your eye on the end prize." Liz introduces the concept of "thinking in time," which involves looking at past experiences, present circumstances, and future predictions and scenarios.

Strategic thinkers are hypothesis-driven and respond intelligently to changes. This approach can be applied to career development, where participants should examine the big picture, look for growing or declining markets, and consider their own goals and values. The course will guide participants through a five-step process to develop their career.

The course aims to help participants think strategically about their careers, rather than just looking for job opportunities. By applying strategic thinking principles, participants can make informed decisions about their career development and create a fulfilling life.

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Set theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with properties of well-defined collections of objects. The concept of sets was introduced by George Cantor, a German mathematician. A set is defined as a collection of any kind of objects, such as people, ideas, or numbers. The empty set is a set that contains nothing and is denoted by curly brackets with no elements inside. Sets can be written in the form E = {elements}, where the elements are listed between curly brackets. For example, the set of positive even numbers less than 10 is represented as E = {2, 4, 6, 8}. The cardinality of a set S, denoted by |S|, is the number of elements in the set. The empty set has no elements and therefore its cardinality is 0.

A set A is considered a subset of another set B if every element of A is also an element of B. This is equivalent to saying that if x is an element of A, then x is also an element of B for all elements x. The empty set is a subset of any set and a set is always a subset of itself. There are special sets such as N (natural numbers), Z (integers), Q (rational numbers), and R (real numbers). Each of these sets can be related to the others, where N is a subset of Z, Z is a subset of Q, and Q is a subset of R.

The concept of set theory forms the basis of several other fields of study such as counting theory, relations, graph theory, and finite state machines. Understanding sets and their properties is essential in these fields.

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

1. The lesson discusses two ways of representing a set: listing method and set-builder notation.
2. The listing method involves listing all elements of a set, as seen in examples such as S1 (vowels in English alphabet) and S2 (positive integers less than 10).
3. Set-builder notation uses a rule of inclusion to describe the set, such as "the set of even positive integers less than 10" or "the set of all rational numbers Q".
4. The set-builder notation can be written in a formulaic way, e.g., S1 = {3n | n ∈ Z, 0 < n < 6}.
5. Rational numbers (Q) can be represented as Q = {n/m | n, m ∈ Z, m ≠ 0}.
6. The set of objects in a bag can also be described using both methods: listing method by listing elements (e.g., pen, book, laptop) and set-builder notation (e.g., "a bag is the set of x, where x is in my bag").
7. Set S1 consists of all integers 3n where n is a natural number strictly less than 6.
8. The value of n in S1 ranges from 1 to 5, resulting in elements {3, 6, 9, 12, 15}.
9. Set S2 represents all numbers of the form 2^n where n is an integer between 0 and 4 (inclusive).
10. S2 can be rewritten as {2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4} = {1, 2, 4, 8, 16}.
11. Set S3 consists of all integers of the form 3n where n is an integer.
12. The elements of S3 are {0, 3, 6, 9, 12}.
13. To summarize, a set can be represented in two ways: by listing its elements or using set-builder notation.
14. Both methods convey the same information about the elements and properties of the set.
15. Understanding both listing method and set-builder notation is essential for working with sets in mathematics and other fields.

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

A power set of a set S is defined as the set whose elements are all the subsets of S. The cardinality of a power set P(S) is equal to 2 raised to the power of the cardinality of S. For example, given a set A with two elements, {a} and {b}, its power set P(A) contains all possible subsets, including the empty set and individual elements.

The elements of a power set are all subsets of S. Therefore, the empty set is an element of a power set, and it is also a subset of any set. The cardinality of a power set of a set with n elements is 2^n.

To find the power set of a given set, we can list all possible subsets or use the rule of inclusion. For example, if S = {1, 2}, its power set P(S) contains 4 subsets: {}, {1}, {2}, and {1, 2}.

The cardinality of a power set is equal to 2 raised to the power of the cardinality of the original set. This means that the number of possible subsets grows exponentially with the size of the original set.

In general, if A is a set containing n elements, then P(A) contains 2^n subsets. If we apply this process again to find the power set of P(A), we get P(P(A)) with 2^(2^n) subsets.

This process can be repeated indefinitely, resulting in an infinite number of power sets. However, the cardinality of each subsequent power set remains a power of 2.

Overall, the concept of a power set provides a way to systematically generate all possible subsets of a given set and understand their relationships with each other.

The relationship between the cardinality of a set S and its corresponding power set P(S) is well-defined: |P(S)| = 2^|S|.

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

The lesson discusses set operations, including intersection, union, difference, and symmetric difference. Given two sets A and B, the union of A and B (A ∪ B) contains all elements in either A or B. The membership table shows combinations of sets that an element belongs to, with 0 indicating not a member and 1 indicating a member. The intersection of A and B (A ∩ B) contains elements belonging to both A and B.

The formula for the union is: X ∈ A ∪ B if and only if X ∈ A or X ∈ B.
The membership table for A ∪ B shows that an element not in A but in B, and vice versa, are included in the union. The intersection (A ∩ B) contains elements belonging to both sets.

For the difference, A \ B, it contains elements in A but not in B: X ∈ A \ B if and only if X ∈ A and X ∉ B.
Membership tables for A \ B show that an element not in A or B is excluded from the difference.

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving the original content:

A set is a fundamental concept in mathematics and computer science, representing a collection of distinct objects considered as an object in its own right.

A set can be defined in two ways: Definition 1 states that a set is a collection of objects, while Definition 2 describes it as an unordered collection of distinct elements.

The symbol ∈ denotes membership in a set, such as "a ∈ A" meaning a is an element of set A. Conversely, a symbol ∉ is used to denote non-membership, like "a ∉ A".

Special sets include N (natural numbers), Z (integers), Q (rational numbers), and R (real numbers).

The empty set, denoted as ∅ or {}, represents a set with no elements.

Cardinality of a set refers to the number of distinct elements in that set. For example, |A| = 4 means the cardinality of set A is 4.

Finite sets have a limited number of elements, while infinite sets have an unlimited number of elements. The set of natural numbers N={1,2,3,…} is an example of an infinite set.

To list all elements in a set using the listing method, simply write down each element within curly braces.

For example, the set A = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7} contains the elements 1 through 7.

Similarly, the set B = {2,4,6,8,10} and set C=N={1,2,3,4,…} also contain their respective listed elements.

This listing method is used to represent sets in a clear and concise manner.

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

A set is a collection of unique objects, known as elements or members, that can be anything (numbers, letters, people, etc.). The definition of a set is based on the concept of an element, which is an object that belongs to the set. A set is defined using curly brackets {} containing the elements separated by commas. For example, {1, 2, 3} represents the set containing the numbers 1, 2, and 3. The cardinality of a set refers to the number of unique elements it contains. The listing method involves writing down all the elements of a set in a specific order, while the rule of inclusion allows us to add or remove elements from a set using logical operations (e.g., ∪ for union, ∩ for intersection). The powerset of a set is the set containing all possible subsets of the original set. For example, the powerset of {1, 2, 3} is {{}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}}. Set operations include union (∪), intersection (∩), difference (-), and complement ('). These operations can be performed using logical rules, such as the distributive property. The set builder method involves constructing a set from a rule or condition that defines its elements. For example, {x | x is an integer} represents the set of all integers. Subsets are sets whose elements are also elements of another set. The problem section for Exercises 2.1 on pp.76 asks students to attempt questions 1-27, 30-36, and 41-44. Solutions to these exercises can be found in the "Solutions to Odd-Numbered Exercises" section at the back of the book.

## Week 10

### Logic gates Video• . Duration: 6 minutes 6 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Logic gates are electronic circuits that process input signals based on logical operations. The most basic logic circuits are OR gates, AND gates, and invertors (NOT gates). Logic gates can have single inputs or multiple inputs and produce either a single output or multiple outputs. The truth tables for these basic gates are used to determine their outputs.

The AND gate produces a high output when all inputs are high, while the OR gate produces a high output when at least one input is high. Invertors flip the input signal. The XOR gate produces a high output when the inputs are different, while the NAND and NOR gates produce a low output when both inputs are high.

The XNOR gate is similar to the XOR gate but inverts the output. Logic gates can be combined to create more complex circuits. The AND, OR, XOR, and XNOR operations are associative and commutative, allowing for the extension of their use to multiple inputs.

De Morgan's laws can be represented using logic gates, with the first law being "the complement of the product is equal to the sum of the complements". The second law states "the compliment of the sum is equal to the product of the complements". Logic gates are used to represent these laws in a visual format.

The lecture introduced and explored logic gates, covering basic gates and their truth tables. It also examined additional gates, such as XOR, NAND, NOR, and XNOR, and their relationships to basic gates. Finally, it discussed the representation of De Morgan's laws using logic gates.

### Combinational circuits Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Combination circuits are networks of logic gates that model Boolean functions. A combination circuit implements a Boolean function given its current configuration of input signals. The goal is to minimize the number of gates used to minimize circuit cost. Boolean functions can be implemented in different ways using combination circuits.

To build a logic network from a Boolean function, label gate outputs as functions of input variables, express Boolean functions for each gate at the first level, and repeat the process until all outputs are written as Boolean expressions. Combinational circuits can be used to design systems for solving specific problems like addition or multiplication.

For example, a half adder can be designed using logic gates to perform binary bit additions. The truth table shows that the sum is represented by the output of the X OR gate, while the carry outputs are represented by the AND gate. To overcome limitations, a full adder with three inputs can be transformed from a half adder.

A full adder's Boolean expression can be represented as x' or y' or carry in, and carry out is expressed as xy plus carry in. These expressions can be designed using a combinational circuit to perform binary bit additions accurately. To simplify complexity, box diagrams are often used to present only inputs and outputs.

This lecture introduced and defined combination circuits, built logic networks from Boolean functions, and showed how they can be used to design systems for solving specific problems.

### Simplification of circuits Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Boolean algebra can be used to represent and simplify Boolean functions. Simplification of circuits is beneficial as it reduces the global cost, computation time, and allows more circuits to be fitted on the same chip. Two types of simplifications are discussed: algebraic simplification and Karnaugh maps. Algebraic simplification uses De Morgan's laws, distributive laws, commutative, idempotent, and complement laws, and absorption law. The Boolean expression E is simplified using these laws to obtain a simpler form. A full adder circuit can also be simplified using these laws. A Karnaugh map (K-map) is a graphical representation of Boolean functions, showing the true table and allowing for simplification by identifying adjacent 1's. K-maps are useful for expressions with 2, 3, 4, or 5 variables. The number of cells in a K-map represents the total number of possible input variables. To simplify a Boolean function using a K-map, identify all 1's and group them into rectangles of maximum size by adjacent 1's, then write terms for each rectangle. This process is called minimization. Minimization can reduce the complexity of circuits and improve their performance. The De Morgan's laws, distributive laws, commutative, idempotent, and complement laws, and absorption law are used to simplify Boolean expressions and functions. These laws can be applied to various types of Boolean functions, including full adders. K-maps provide a visual representation of Boolean functions and are useful for simplifying and minimizing these functions. The simplified form of the Boolean expression E is x plus yz, which represents a minimized version of the original function.

Note that I did not include any specific formulas or technical details as they were not mentioned in the provided text, but rather focused on summarizing the main concepts and ideas discussed in the lecture.

### Simplification of circuits Reading• . Duration: 15 minutes 15 min

Here are the key points from the text:

The simplification of circuits using Boolean algebra involves applying postulates and theorems to reduce complexity and simplify digital circuits.

A common technique for simplifying Boolean expressions is by using rules of Boolean algebra such as distributive law, idempotent law, absorption law.

Consider a circuit with two OR gates and three AND gates. The output F(A,B,C) can be simplified using Boolean algebra as follows:

F(A,B,C) = A.B + A.(B+C) + B.(B+C)

By applying the distributive law, we get:

F(A,B,C) = A.B + A.B + A.C + B.B + B.C

Using idempotent law and absorption law, we simplify further:

F(A,B,C) = A.B + A.C + B + B.C

This simplifies to:

F(A,B,C) = B + AC

The original circuit can be simplified to two basic digital logic gates: an AND gate and an OR gate.

Another way of simplifying circuits is by using a Karnaugh map to simplify the corresponding Boolean expression.

### Domino logic gates simulation Reading• . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving all key information, formulae, and technical details:

Logic gates are basic elements of electronic circuits that implement Boolean operations. Computers are composed of billions of these tiny electrical components. Logic gates take input information and output processed information accordingly depending on their characteristics. The complexity of computers is difficult to visualize due to the electrical signals they receive. A dominoes-based simulation can be used to represent this process, where a chain of falling dominoes represents high voltage and standing dominoes represent low voltage.

The Domino logic gates simulation allows users to simulate different types of logic gates, including OR, AND, and XOR gates. The simulation also includes a 2-bit binary addition using a combination of these gates. Users can navigate through the simulations by clicking on buttons at the bottom corners or reset the current simulation by clicking the central button.

The next exercise will involve simulating more complex logic gates and learning how to replicate them with real dominoes. The simulation is designed to be interactive, allowing users to experiment with different inputs and observe the output. Logic gates are a fundamental concept in computer science, and understanding their behavior is crucial for designing electronic circuits.

In addition to the Domino logic gates simulation, there are several other resources available for learning about logic gates and combinatorial circuits. These include videos, practice assignments, and reading materials. The lesson includes a peer-graded assignment on Boolean algebra and a summative assessment at the end of the topic.

Set theory involves understanding sets as collections of distinct objects, with key operations including intersection, union, and difference. Venn diagrams are used to visually display the relationship among sets and their elements. Power sets are the collection of all subsets that can be formed from a given set, including the empty set.

Functions are rules that assign exactly one output to each input, with types including injections, surjections, and bijections. Composition of functions involves applying one function to the result of another, creating a composite function. The inverse of a function reverses the action of the original function. Logarithms represent the power to which a specified base number must be raised to obtain a specific number.

Propositional logic deals with propositions that are either true or false and argument forms involving propositions. Truth tables, tautologies, contrapositives, inverses, and converses are essential concepts in propositional logic. Logical arguments involve forming conclusions based on a set of premises, with validity depending on whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises.

Predicates and quantifiers are used to build logical expressions that make more complex assertions about objects in a domain. Boolean algebra deals with variables that take only two values, with operations including AND, OR, and NOT. Logic circuits, De Morgan's laws, Karnaugh maps, and sum of products are integral parts of Boolean algebra. Understanding these concepts is essential for solving equations and interpreting logarithmic expressions.

The midterm exam review includes practice questions, reading materials, and a video tutorial to help students prepare for the exam. The review covers set theory, functions, logarithms, propositional logic, logical arguments, predicates, and Boolean algebra, providing students with a comprehensive understanding of these key concepts.

### [IMPORTANT] - Mid-term Assessment [001] Question3 (e) Update Reading• . Duration: 3 minutes 3 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving all key information, formulae, and technical details:

The instructor has made a correction to Question 3(e) regarding tautologies. The revised question states that a tautology is a proposition that is always true. Three propositions, p, q, and r, are introduced. The student is asked to determine whether ((p ∨ q) ∧ (r → s)) ⟺ ((p ∧ r) → s) ∧ ((q ∧ r) → s) is a tautology or not. A truth table can be used to analyze the given proposition. To solve this problem, the student needs to use the laws of propositions or the truth table. The correct solution involves using De Morgan's law and other logical equivalences to simplify the expression. The student should show that the two expressions are logically equivalent. If the two expressions are logically equivalent, then ((p ∨ q) ∧ (r → s)) ⟺ ((p ∧ r) → s) ∧ ((q ∧ r) → s) is a tautology. Otherwise, it is not a tautology. The student can use truth tables or logical equivalences to determine the nature of the proposition. The instructor provides additional resources and guidance for students to complete the problem. The correct answer should be provided in the Mid-Term Assessment [001] activity. The instructor thanks students for taking the time to read the correction and wishes them luck with their coursework.

### The principle of mathematical induction Video• . Duration: 3 minutes 3 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Mathematical induction is a principle used to assert that a propositional function P(n) is true for all positive integers n. The formal definition of mathematical induction involves two steps: the basic step (proving P(1) is true) and the inductive step (proving that if P(k) is true, then P(k+1) is also true). The intuition behind induction is that if a property holds true for one value (P(1)), it will hold true for all subsequent values due to the iterative application of the property. This can be formalized using the following rule of inference: P(1) is true, and for all k, P(k) implies P(k+1). Therefore, for all n, P(n) is true. Mathematical induction can be used to prove statements about formulas, inequalities, divisibility, properties of subsets, and their cardinality. It can also be applied to assert that a propositional function P(n) is true for all integers greater than a particular integer. The structure of mathematical induction involves verifying the basic step (P(1) = True) and the inductive step (if P(k) is true, then P(k+1) is also true). In strong induction, the assumption that P(k-1) is true is made before the induction hypothesis. Mathematical induction can be used to prove statements about infinite sequences, allowing for the conclusion that a statement holds true for all positive integers. The principle of mathematical induction has various applications in mathematics and other fields, including algebra, geometry, and computer science. It provides a powerful tool for proving statements about properties of numbers and functions. By using mathematical induction, mathematicians can establish the validity of a wide range of statements with high confidence.

### Proof by induction Video• . Duration: 7 minutes 7 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Mathematical induction is a method used to prove formulas, inequalities, and divisibility for all positive integers. To prove a propositional function P(n), two steps must be verified: the basis step (P(1) is true) and the inductive step (if P(k) is true, then P(k+1) is true). The formula "sum from 1 to n is equal n multiplied by n plus 1 divided by 2" can be proved using mathematical induction. The basis step states that for n=1, the sum from 1 to 1 is indeed equal 1*(1+1)/2 = 1. The inductive step involves assuming P(k) is true and showing that P(k+1) is also true. For example, if P(n) states "3^n is less than n!", then if P(7) is true (3^7 < 7!), it can be shown that P(8) is also true (3^8 < 8!). Mathematical induction can be used to prove inequalities and divisibility as well. For instance, it can be used to prove "6^n+4 is divisible by 5" for all positive integers n. However, not all statements can be proved using mathematical induction. An incorrect example of an induction proof is given, where the statement "2^i = sum from i=0 to n-1 2^i" is claimed to be true, but it is actually false (e.g., 2^0 ≠ 3). This highlights the importance of verifying both the basis step and inductive step to avoid false conclusions. In general, mathematical induction requires careful attention to both steps to ensure a valid proof.

### Strong induction Video• . Duration: 7 minutes 7 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving all key information, formulae, and technical details:

Strong induction is another form of mathematical induction that can be formalized using the following rule of inference: P(k) is true for all k in N, if P(1), P(2), ..., P(k-1) are true, then implies P(k) is true. This means that for all n in N, if P(n) is true for all n ≤ k, then P(k+1) is also true. The well-ordering property states that every nonempty subset of the positive integers has a least element. Mathematical induction can be used to prove statements about natural numbers, and it is equivalent to strong induction and the well-ordering property. A statement P(n) for all n in N where n ≥ 2, n is divisible by a prime number, was proved using strong induction. The basis step involves verifying that 2 is divisible by itself, while the inductive step involves assuming P(k) is true and showing that P(k+1) is also true. The well-ordering property can be used to prove statements about natural numbers by contradiction. Let S be a nonempty set of positive integers with no prime divisor, and assume it has a smallest element n. Then n cannot be prime, so it must have a divisor d between 1 and n, which leads to a contradiction. Therefore, S is empty, verifying the statement P(n). The principles of mathematical induction, strong induction, and well-ordering are all equivalent, meaning that each implies the validity of the other two techniques. This means that proofs using one technique can be adapted for use with another technique if necessary. Strong induction was introduced as an alternative to mathematical induction, but it has a similar structure and proof style. The formal expression of strong induction involves assuming P(1), P(2), ..., P(k-1) are true and showing that P(k+1) is also true. This can be used to prove statements about natural numbers in different ways.

## Week 12

### Recursive definitions Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Recursive definitions are used to define mathematical objects in terms of themselves. A recursively defined function f with domain n has two steps: basis step and recursive step. The basis step specifies an initial value of the function, while the recursive step provides a rule for finding the value of the function at an integer from its values at smaller integers.

For example, the sequence aN can be defined as 4n, 4^n, or 4 with different definitions. A set S can also be defined recursively by specifying initial elements and providing a rule for constructing new elements from those already in the set.

Algorithms are finite sequences of precise instructions for performing computations or solving problems. An algorithm is called recursive if it solves a problem by reducing it to an instance of the same problem with smaller inputs. For example, n factorial can be recursively defined as 0! = 1 and n! = n * (n-1)!, where n is a non-negative integer.

Recursive definitions are used in mathematics to define complex objects such as functions, sequences, and sets. They provide a way to break down problems into smaller instances of the same problem, making it easier to solve them. The key concepts in this lecture include recursive definitions, basis steps, recursive steps, and algorithms with recursion.

The formulas and technical details used in this lecture include:

* aN = 4n (sequence)
* aN = 4^n (sequence)
* aN = 4 (sequence)
* S = {x | x is an integer such that x = 4y for some integer y} (set)

The key concepts and findings of this lecture are:

* Recursive definitions provide a way to define complex objects in terms of themselves.
* Basis steps and recursive steps are used to define recursive functions, sequences, and sets.
* Algorithms with recursion can be used to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller instances of the same problem.

### Recurrence relations Video• . Duration: 9 minutes 9 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

A recurrence relation defines a sequence based on a rule that gives the next term as a function of previous terms. An infinite sequence is a function from the set of positive integers to the set of real numbers. The Hanoi Tower problem involves transferring n discs from one spoke to another without placing a larger disc on top of a smaller one, with an equation relating the minimum number of moves (an) to n.

A linear recurrence relation has each term as a linear function of earlier terms in the sequence, with two types: homogeneous and non-homogeneous. The Fibonacci sequence is an example of a second-order linear recurrence relation. An arithmetic sequence has a constant difference between consecutive terms, while a geometric sequence has a constant ratio between consecutive terms.

The number of moves required to transfer n discs from one spoke to another can be expressed as the equation an = 2an-1 + 1. A first-order linear recurrence relates the population in N years from now (an+1) to the previous term (an), with initial conditions a0 = 50 million and an+1 = 1.01an + 50,000.

Divide and conquer algorithms solve problems by dividing them into smaller subproblems, solving recursively each subproblem, and combining solutions. The problem of finding the minimum of a sequence can be solved using this approach. Recurrence relations are essential in solving many types of mathematical problems.

In conclusion, recurrence relations are used to define sequences based on rules that give next terms as functions of previous terms. Linear recurrences relate terms by linear functions of earlier terms, while arithmetic and geometric sequences have constant differences or ratios between consecutive terms. Divide and conquer algorithms can be applied to solve many types of mathematical problems.

### Solving recurrence relations Video• . Duration: 8 minutes 8 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

A recurrence relation can be solved using linear homogeneous recurrences and strong induction. A linear homogeneous recurrence has the form $a_n = c_1a_{n-1} + \cdots + c_ka_{n-k}$, where each term is a multiple of the previous term. The characteristic equation is obtained by dividing both sides by $a_{n-k}$, resulting in $r^n = c_1r^{n-1} + \cdots + c_k$. Solving this equation gives a solution to the recurrence relation.

The Fibonacci recurrence relation is an example of a linear homogeneous recurrence with two distinct roots: $r_1 = 1 + \sqrt{5}/2$ and $r_2 = 1 - \sqrt{5}/2$. The general solution to the Fibonacci recurrence relation is given by $F_n = A_1r_1^n + A_2r_2^n$, where $A_1$ and $A_2$ are constants determined using initial conditions.

In a strong induction proof, we prove that a statement $P(n)$ is true for all integers $n \geq k$, given that it holds for $0, 1, 2, ..., k-1$. To do this, we first verify the base case ($P(k)$), and then assume $P(0), P(1), ..., P(k-1)$ are true. We then show that $P(k+1)$ is also true using these assumptions.

In the context of recurrence relations, strong induction can be used to prove that a solution to a linear homogeneous recurrence relation satisfies the given recurrence relation.

### Recursive definitions Reading• . Duration: 15 minutes 15 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Recursive definitions are used to define objects, functions, sequences, and sets in discrete mathematics. A recursive definition consists of a base case and a recursive step. The base case provides an initial value or set of values for the object being defined. The recursive step defines how to derive new elements from existing ones using the same definition.

In sequences, the recursive step applies to each term based on the previous one. For example, the Fibonacci sequence is defined recursively as F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2). In sets, the recursive step specifies a rule for generating new elements from those already in the set.

Recursively defined functions take an integer n and compute its value using smaller integers. The base case provides the starting values. Defining a recursive function f(n) is equivalent to defining a sequence.

Recursive definitions are useful for simplifying and solving complex mathematical problems. They are crucial in both theoretical and practical applications within computer science and mathematics.

The Fibonacci sequence can be defined recursively as F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1, and F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1. The set of positive integers that are multiples of 6 can also be defined recursively.

Recursion is not syllogism, but a process called recursion, where an object is defined in terms of itself. Recursively defined functions and sets provide a clear and concise way to define complex mathematical objects.

The conclusion is that understanding recursive definitions is crucial for grasping how they are used to simplify and solve complex mathematical problems. This lesson provides a foundational understanding of recursion in defining sequences and sets, which is essential in both theoretical and practical applications within computer science and mathematics.

### Topic 6 essential reading Reading• . Duration: 1 hour 45 minutes 1h 45m

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences:

The textbook by Koshy covers topics such as recursion, recursively defined functions, sets, and algorithms. The definition of recursion is discussed, which states that a function f is recursive if f(f(x)) = f(x) for all x in its domain. Recursively defined functions are functions that can be defined using other instances of the same function. There are three types of recursively defined functions: direct recursion, indirect recursion, and mixed recursion. The textbook also covers recursively defined sets, which are sets that can be defined using recursive formulas. These sets have a similar structure to the set of natural numbers, with each element being represented as a pair of smaller elements. Recursively defined algorithms are used to solve problems efficiently by breaking them down into smaller sub-problems. Examples of such algorithms include merge sort and binary search. The textbook also covers recurrence relations, which are equations that define how a sequence evolves over time. Solving recurrence relations is essential for understanding many algorithmic techniques, including dynamic programming and greedy algorithms. Recurrence relations can be solved using various methods, including substitution and iteration. In addition to these topics, the textbook provides essential reading material on recursion.

### Topic 7 introduction Video• . Duration: 3 minutes 3 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences:

Graph theory is an area of discrete mathematics that studies configurations called graphs, involving sets of vertices interconnected with edges. A graph is a discrete structure consisting of vertices or nodes and edges connecting them. Graphs can be used to model real-world problems, such as computer networks, roadmaps, shortest path problems between cities, and assigning jobs to employees in an organization.

The first problem in graph theory was the Seven Bridges of Konigsberg problem, which was solved by Leonhard Euler in 1735. Euler showed that it is impossible to take a walk and cross all seven bridges only once using a specific graph model. Graphs can be used to represent real-world problems as a set of vertices and edges, where each vertex represents an item or location, and each edge represents a connection between them.

Graph theory has many applications in various disciplines, including computer science, chemistry, and physics. It can be used to distinguish chemical compounds' structures, model molecules, and gain insight into physical properties of chemical compounds. The gas butane can be represented by a graph structure where the carbon items are vertices and the chemical bonds are edges.

In this lecture, an informal definition of graphs was given, and real-world applications of graph theory were discussed. Graph theory is used to create abstraction from real-world problems that can be understood and manipulated by computers. Computer scientists use graph models to design computer circuits, schedule final exams, and solve other complex problems. The next lesson will discuss graphs in more detail.

Key concepts such as walks, paths, and circuits in graph theory were also discussed. Graphs have various types of edges, including dry land (vertices) and bridges (edges). The degree sequence of a graph refers to the number of edges connected to each vertex. Special graphs, such as simple, r-regular, and complete graphs, were also introduced.

Overall, graph theory is a fundamental area of discrete mathematics that provides a powerful tool for solving complex problems in various disciplines.

### Definition of a graph Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

A graph is a discrete structure consisting of vertices and edges connecting them. A graph G can be represented by a pair VE, where V is a set of nodes (vertices) and E is a set of edges. The set of vertices of a graph G is usually denoted by V(G) or just V. An edge is a link between two vertices, drawn as a line connecting them. The set of edges in a graph G is usually denoted by E(G) or just E. Two vertices are said to be adjacent if they are endpoints of the same edge, and two edges are said to be adjacent if they share the same vertex.

The adjacency of vertices can be defined using the concept of incident edges, where an edge e and a vertex v are said to be incident if v is an endpoint of e. A directed graph, or digraph, is a graph in which the edges have a direction, indicated by an arrow on the edge. In this lecture, we defined what a graph is, annotated its basic elements (vertices and edges), explained the concept of adjacency, and introduced directed graphs.

The definition of a graph can be formalized as follows: a graph G = (V, E) consists of a set V of vertices and a set E of edges. A vertex v is said to be adjacent to another vertex u if there exists an edge e such that v and u are endpoints of e. An edge e is said to be incident on a vertex v if v is an endpoint of e. The degree sequence of a graph G refers to the sequence of degrees of all vertices in G.

Special types of graphs include simple graphs, r-regular graphs, and complete graphs. Simple graphs have no multiple edges or loops, while r-regular graphs have exactly r edges incident on each vertex. Complete graphs are graphs in which every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge. These concepts form the foundation of graph theory, a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of graphs and their properties.

The video lectures cover these topics in detail, including the definition of a graph, walks and paths in a graph, circuits in a graph, and special graphs such as simple, r-regular, and complete graphs. The practice assignments provide opportunities for students to apply their knowledge and reinforce their understanding of these concepts.

### Walks and paths in a graph Video• . Duration: 11 minutes 11 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving all key information, formulae, and technical details:

A walk in a graph is a sequence of vertices and edges where vertices and edges can be repeated. A walk of length k in a graph is a succession of k edges that are not necessarily different. A trail is a walk in which no edge is repeated, while a circuit is a closed trail with repeated vertices only.

A path is a trail in which neither vertices nor edges are repeated, and the length of a path is equal to the number of edges it contains. A cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex. An Eulerian path visits each edge of a graph exactly once, while a Hamiltonian path visits each vertex of a graph exactly once.

A strongly connected digraph has a directed path between all pairs of vertices, while a connected undirected graph has a path connecting any two nodes. The transitive closure of a digraph G is the digraph G* that contains a directed edge from U to V if there exists a directed path from U to V in G.

A simple graph has no multiple edges between any pair of vertices, an r-regular graph has exactly r edges incident on each vertex, and a complete graph has an edge between every pair of vertices. The degree sequence of a graph is the sequence of degrees of its vertices. Understanding these concepts is essential for studying graph theory and its applications in computer science and other fields.

A digraph can be classified into different types based on its connectivity properties, such as strongly connected or weakly connected graphs. The transitive closure provides reachability information about a digraph, allowing us to determine whether there exists a directed path between two vertices.

### The degree sequence of a graph Video• . Duration: 8 minutes 8 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving all key information, formulae, and technical details:

1. A graph can be represented using its degree sequence, which is a sequence of the degree of each vertex in descending order.
2. The degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it, with loops contributing twice to the degree and isolated vertices having a degree of 0.
3. In directed graphs, there are two types of degrees: out-degree (number of edges that start at the vertex) and in-degree (number of edges that end at the vertex).
4. The degree sequence is defined as a list of the degrees of all vertices in the graph, separated by commas.
5. One property of the degree sequence is that its sum is always even, which means it's impossible to construct a graph with an odd sum.
6. Another property is that the sum of the degree sequence is twice the number of edges in the graph, making the number of edges equal to half the sum of the degree sequence.
7. This relationship can be expressed mathematically as: ∑deg(v) = 2|E|, where ∑deg(v) is the sum of the degrees and |E| is the number of edges.
8. The degree sequence provides a way to describe a graph without explicitly drawing its edges or vertices.
9. It's possible to construct graphs with certain degree sequences by starting with an empty graph and adding edges until the desired degree distribution is achieved.
10. For example, given a degree sequence 3,2,2,1, it's possible to construct a graph with 4 vertices, where each vertex has the specified degree.
11. However, other degree sequences, like 3,3,2,1, are impossible to construct because their sum is odd.
12. The degree sequence can be used to analyze and understand properties of graphs, such as connectivity and clustering coefficients.
13. By analyzing the degree sequence, we can infer information about the graph's structure and behavior.
14. The concept of the degree sequence is a fundamental aspect of graph theory, providing a concise way to describe complex networks.
15. It has numerous applications in fields like computer science, physics, biology, and social network analysis, among others.

### Walks, paths and circuits in graph theory Reading• . Duration: 15 minutes 15 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Graph theory is a fundamental area of discrete mathematics with applications in computer science, biology, sociology, and many other fields. A walk in a graph is an alternating sequence of vertices and edges, starting and ending with a vertex, where vertices and edges can be repeated. A walk can be represented as: v0, e1, v1, e2, ..., ek, vk where vi = (vi−1, vi) for i = 1, 2, ..., k. Examples of walks include sequences that start and end at a vertex, passing through another vertex, such as (a, b), b, (b, d), d, (d, a), a. A walk can also be a sequence that starts and ends at the same vertex, visiting each edge exactly once, such as (a, b), b, (b, d), d, (d, a), a. A path is a walk in which all vertices and edges are distinct. Formally, a path from vertex u to vertex v can be represented as: u = v0, e1, v1, e2, ..., ek, vk = v where vi ≠ vj for all i ≠ j. This ensures that a path does not revisit any vertex. An example of a path from a to d is: a, (a, b), b, (b, d), d. A circuit is a walk that starts and ends at the same vertex, with all edges distinct. Formally, a circuit can be represented as: v0, e1, v1, e2, ..., ek, vk = v0 where vi ≠ vj for all i ≠ j except vi = vk. Understanding walks, paths, and circuits is essential in various applications, including Network Routing and Social Networks. Graph theory provides the foundation for more advanced topics and applications, such as special graphs like simple, r-regular, and complete graphs.

The work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution- Alike 4.0 International License. After completing the reading, students are encouraged to attempt exercises that match the corresponding pages and sections in the textbooks. Exercises for Koshy can be found on p.534, while those for Levin are located on pp.243, 242-43, and 277-80. The solutions to these exercises can be found at the back of the books under specific sections. Students are advised to consult the solution section if they need help with their answers. Graph theory is an essential concept in various fields, including computer science and engineering. A graph is defined as a set of vertices connected by edges, where each edge has a label or weight associated with it. The degree sequence of a graph refers to the number of edges incident on each vertex. Simple graphs have no multiple edges between any two vertices, while regular graphs have equal degrees for all vertices. Complete graphs are those where every pair of distinct vertices is connected by an edge. Graphs also include paths and circuits, which are sequences of edges connecting vertices in a specific order. The degree sequence of a graph can be used to determine its properties and behavior. In the context of graph theory, simple, regular, and complete graphs have important applications in computer science, engineering, and other fields.

### Isomorphic graphs Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Two graphs, G1 and G2, are isomorphic if there exists a bijection (invertible function) F that maps all vertices of G1 to vertices of G2 while preserving adjacency and non-adjacency. This means that for any two vertices U and V in G1, if uv is an edge, then f(U)f(V) is an edge in G2, and vice versa. The concept of isomorphism aims to show that two graphs may appear different but are actually the same. An example of this can be seen with the graphs G1 and G2, where a mapping function f can be defined to establish isomorphism between them. A bijective function preserves adjacency and non-adjacency, as shown in the example of graph G1 mapped onto graph G2 using the function f. Two graphs cannot be isomorphic if they have different degree sequences. For instance, two 3-regular simple connected graphs with four vertices cannot be isomorphic due to their differing degree sequences. However, two graphs can have the same degree sequence and still not be isomorphic. This can be proven by showing that a one-to-one correspondence between the vertex sets of these graphs preserves adjacency but does not exist. The three graphs shown in the example are 2-regular simple connected with four vertices and exhibit isomorphism among themselves through bijection. Similarly, the two graphs shown in another example are 3-regular simple connected with six vertices and can be proven to be isomorphic through a bijective mapping function. In contrast, the final pair of graphs are 2-regular simple connected with five vertices but lack an identifiable bijection, hence cannot be proven to be isomorphic based on given criteria. The concept of isomorphism in graph theory highlights that similarity between graphs may imply underlying structural equivalence despite surface-level dissimilarities. Understanding this relationship between graph structure and adjacency through mapping functions can aid in identifying distinct patterns across various types of connected networks.

### Bipartite graphs Video• . Duration: 9 minutes 9 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

A bipartite graph is a special type of graph where the set of vertices can be divided into two sets, V1 and V2, such that each edge connects one vertex from V1 to one vertex from V2. A bipartite graph is two-colorable, meaning it can be represented using two colors, which are used to represent vertices in V1 (e.g., orange) and vertices in V2 (e.g., yellow). One important property of bipartite graphs is that they have no cycles of odd length.

A matching in a bipartite graph is a set of pairwise non-adjacent edges with no shared endpoints. A vertex is matched or saturated if it's an endpoint of one of the edges, otherwise it's unmatched. The maximum matching is the largest possible number of edges that can still form a matching when adding any edge would break it.

The Hopcroft-Karp algorithm is used to find the maximum matching in a bipartite graph. It uses two other algorithms: breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS). The algorithm starts with all nodes in each side of the graph where C and J have no pairings and iterates through BFS and DFS to find augmenting paths.

An augmenting path is an alternating sequence of unmatched edges ending on a free node, which augments the cardinality of the current machine. In the first iteration, BFS finds three trees connecting nodes in C to nodes in J. The maximum matching is found when an augmenting path is discovered from node J2 up to C1.

The second iteration starts with DFS and finds an augmenting path from node J3 up to C3. This results in a semi-matched graph. After the second iteration, every job seeker is matched to a job.

### The adjacency matrix of a graph Video• . Duration: 9 minutes 9 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

A graph can be represented by a set of vertices and a set of edges or connections. The adjacency list represents a graph as a list of vertices and their corresponding individual adjacent vertices. For example, the adjacency list of the graph shown below is as follows: vertex A has B and C as its adjacent vertices, vertex B has A, C, and D as its adjacent vertices, and so on.

A graph can also be represented by its corresponding adjacency matrix. The adjacency matrix represents a graph as a set of entries m_ij, where i and j represent the vertices of the graph. The values in the leading diagonal are loops, which means there is an edge between a vertex and itself.

The number of edges in an undirected graph is equal to half the sum of all the elements m_ij of its corresponding adjacency matrix. This can be expressed as m = (1/2) * ∑m_ij. The sum of all the elements of the adjacency matrix is equal to the sum of the degree sequences of the graph.

For example, given the graph with vertices v_1, v_2, and v_3, the degree sequence is [4, 5, 3], and the sum of the degree sequences is 12. The corresponding adjacency matrix has a sum of elements equal to 12, which matches the number of edges in the graph (6).

The adjacency matrix of a directed graph represents the direction of each edge. In this case, each entry m_ij represents the number of paths from vertex i to vertex j.

For instance, in the given directed graph, the first row of M^2 shows that there is one path of length 2 from v_1 to v_1, four paths of length 2 from v_1 to v_1, and so on for other vertices.

### Dijkstra's algorithm Video• . Duration: 8 minutes 8 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

1. Dijkstra's algorithm is used to compute the shortest path between two vertices in a weighted graph.
2. A weighted graph is a graph where each edge has a numerical value assigned to it, representing the distance or cost between nodes.
3. In 1956, Edsger Dijkstra introduced an algorithm to find the shortest path between any two nodes in a graph.
4. The algorithm works by iteratively selecting the unvisited vertex with the smallest known distance from the starting node and updating its neighbors' distances.
5. The first step of the algorithm is initialization, where the distance from the starting node to itself is set to zero, and all other distances are initialized to infinity.
6. The second step is the update step, where the algorithm visits each unvisited vertex with a known distance, updates its neighbors' distances if necessary, and marks it as visited.
7. This process continues until all vertices have been visited, resulting in a complete table of shortest distances from the starting node to any other node.

The final answer is: $\boxed{6}$

### Topic 8 introduction Video• . Duration: 2 minutes 2 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

A mathematical concept known as "trees" is discussed, with an analogy to nature. In computer science, trees are represented upside down and have various applications. Trees can be used to represent organizational charts, file systems, and centralized version control systems. They are particularly useful in algorithms, such as finding the shortest path in a graph. Binary trees are a fundamental data structure in high-level programming. The lecture will examine the properties of trees and their application to real-world problems. Informal definitions of trees have been provided, with an upcoming lecture covering their properties. Trees can be used to model procedures carried out using a sequence of decisions. They have applications in games like checker and chess to determine winning strategies. A binary tree is defined as a fundamental data structure in high-level programming.

### Definition of a tree Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

A graph G is considered acyclic if it has no cycles, including loops and parallel edges. The directed graph G1 contains at least one cycle and is therefore not acyclic. In contrast, the directed graph G2 is cycle-free and hence acyclic. An undirected graph G is a tree if and only if it is connected and acyclic. This means that there exists a path between any two vertices of G, and G has no cycles. The graph G1 is connected but not a tree because it contains at least one cycle. On the other hand, the graph G2 is both connected and cycle-free, making it a tree. A forest in graph theory refers to a cycle-free disconnected graph. An undirected graph is considered a tree if there exists a unique simple path between any two of its vertices. This property can be proven by contradiction, where assuming a non-unique path leads to a cycle, contradicting the definition of a tree. By this reasoning, a tree with n vertices has exactly n-1 edges. A rooted tree is defined as a tree in which one vertex is designated as the root, and every edge is directed away from the root. The concept of tracing graph theory introduces the idea of analyzing graphs by identifying cycles and paths. Understanding acyclic graphs, trees, and rooted trees is essential for studying graph theory.

### Spanning trees of a graph Video• . Duration: 3 minutes 3 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

A spanning tree of a graph G is a connected cycle-free subgraph that contains all the vertices of G. A more formal definition states that a spanning tree T is a subgraph of G such that every vertex of G is in T, and T has no cycles. To construct a spanning tree, one can start with an empty tree and add edges to connect all the vertices while avoiding cycles. The number of possible spanning trees for a graph with n vertices increases exponentially with n. For example, a graph with 4 vertices can have 8 or 16 possible spanning trees, depending on its structure. Two spanning trees are isomorphic if there exists a bijection between them that preserves adjacency. Isomorphic spanning trees represent the same underlying structure. When drawing all spanning trees of a graph, it's only necessary to draw non-isomorphic ones to avoid duplicates. The concept of spanning trees has applications in real-life problems like Internet multicasting. Identifying the trees within a graph is crucial for understanding its properties and behavior. Graphs with many vertices can have an enormous number of possible spanning trees, making analysis and visualization challenging. The definition of a tree is closely related to spanning trees, as any subgraph that includes all vertices and no cycles can be considered a tree. Understanding spanning trees is essential for solving problems in graph theory and computer science.

### Minimum spanning tree Video• . Duration: 7 minutes 7 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving all key information, formulae, and technical details:

A minimum cost spanning tree is a subgraph that connects all vertices in a connected undirected graph with the minimum total edge weight. The weight of a spanning tree is the sum of the weights of its edges. Two algorithms are used to find minimum cost spanning trees: Kruskal's algorithm and Prim's algorithm.

Kruskal's algorithm starts by selecting the cheapest edge in the graph that is not part of the current spanning tree. If adding this edge would form a cycle, it is skipped. Otherwise, it is added to the spanning tree. This process is repeated until all vertices are connected.

Prim's algorithm also starts with an arbitrary node and adds the smallest edge incident to that node to the spanning tree. The node is then removed from consideration, and the next smallest edge incident to the remaining nodes is selected. This process continues until all vertices are connected.

A key concept in both algorithms is the use of disjoint sets (also known as union-find data structures) to detect cycles and ensure that the resulting graph is a minimum spanning tree.

In Kruskal's algorithm, the edges are sorted by weight, and the cheapest edge that does not form a cycle is selected. In Prim's algorithm, the smallest edge incident to each node is chosen until all nodes are connected.

Both algorithms have time complexity of O(E log E) or O(E + V), where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices in the graph. The algorithms also use a disjoint set data structure to keep track of the connected components and detect cycles.

The minimum cost spanning tree has the lowest total edge weight among all possible spanning trees of the graph.

### Topic 8 essential reading Reading• . Duration: 30 minutes 30 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences:

The provided text discusses various topics in graph theory, including trees, spanning trees, weighed graphs, minimum spanning trees, and Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms.

These topics will be covered through extracts from two textbooks: Koshy and Levin.

The definition of a tree is discussed, although the exact content is not specified.

Spanning trees are introduced as subgraphs that connect all vertices in a graph without forming any cycles.

Weighted graphs are also mentioned, which implies that the weights or costs associated with edges will be considered.

Minimum spanning trees (MSTs) are defined as subsets of edges in a weighted graph that connect all vertices without forming any cycles and have the minimum total weight.

Two algorithms for finding MSTs are presented: Prim's algorithm and Kruskal's algorithm.

Prim's algorithm is a greedy algorithm that starts with an arbitrary vertex and grows the tree by adding the smallest-weight edge that does not form a cycle.

Kruskal's algorithm, on the other hand, sorts all edges in non-decreasing order of their weights and then adds them to the tree one by one.

The text also mentions video lectures, practice assignments, and reading topics for further learning and exploration.

There are exercises provided at the end of each chapter or section, which students can attempt to check their understanding and learn from mistakes.

Video lectures cover various aspects of these topics in 2-7 minute segments.

Practice assignments allow students to apply theoretical concepts to practical problems and reinforce their learning.

## Week 16

### Rooted trees Video• . Duration: 8 minutes 8 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

A rooted tree is a directed tree with a distinguished vertex called the root, such that there is a directed path from the root to every other vertex. A rooted tree can be represented as a graph if one vertex has an in-degree of zero, while all other vertices have an in-degree of one. The depth or path length of a node in a tree is the number of edges from the root to that node. The height of a node in a tree is the longest path from that node to a leaf. The depth of a tree, also known as its height, is the maximum path length across all its nodes.

A binary tree is a rooted tree with every vertex having two or fewer children. A ternary tree is a rooted tree with every vertex having three or fewer children. An m-ary tree is a rooted tree with every vertex having m or fewer children. An m-ary tree is regular if every internal node has exactly m children.

The maximum number of vertices at level h in an m-ary tree is m^h, while the maximum number of edges in an m-ary tree of h levels is m_h + 1 - 1 / (m - 1).

Two graphs, trees, or trees with different degree sequences are not isomorphic. Two trees with the same degree sequence may or may not be isomorphic.

An isomorphism between two graphs is a bijection that preserves adjacency and non-adjacency. For rooted trees, an isomorphism also requires mapping the root of one tree to the root of the other tree.

Isomorphic trees as rooted trees have additional properties, such as having the same degree sequence at each level.

### Rooted trees Reading• . Duration: 15 minutes 15 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences:

Rooted trees are a fundamental concept in graph theory with wide-ranging applications in computer science, data structures, and algorithms. Understanding rooted trees is essential for tackling problems involving hierarchical structures and recursive data. A rooted tree is defined as a tree where each node has at most two children. The root of the tree is the topmost node, while parent-child relationships are established between nodes. Siblings are nodes with the same parent, and leaves are nodes with no children. Internal nodes are those that have children. Tree levels and height refer to the depth and distance from the root node. Binary trees are a type of rooted tree where each node has at most two children. Binary search trees (BSTs) facilitate efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations by maintaining a sorted order. Balanced trees like AVL trees and Red-Black trees maintain balanced heights to ensure optimal performance. Understanding these concepts is crucial for working with hierarchical structures in computer science. The study of rooted trees has wide applications in data structures and algorithms. Rooted trees are used to model real-world hierarchies, such as file systems or organizational structures. Learning about rooted trees equips students with the necessary skills to tackle complex problems involving recursive data and hierarchical structures.

### Binary search trees Reading• . Duration: 15 minutes 15 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

A binary search tree (BST) is a type of binary tree that maintains a sorted order of elements. Each node in a BST contains a value, pointer to the left child, and pointer to the right child. The BST property states that the left subtree of a node contains only nodes with values less than the node's value. The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with values greater than the node's value. Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees. To build a binary search tree, one can start with an empty tree and recursively add nodes with values that maintain the BST property. The height of a binary search tree is determined by the maximum depth of the tree, which is calculated using the formula H = log2(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. Binary trees are used to search for values on a sorted list by traversing the tree from left to right. This type of search is more efficient than linear searches, especially for large datasets. To find the height of a binary search tree, one can use the formula H = log2(n) or recursively traverse the tree and keep track of the depth. The key concept in building a binary search tree is maintaining the BST property, which ensures that all nodes are sorted. Understanding how to build and traverse binary search trees is essential for searching large datasets efficiently.

### Topic 8 summary Reading• . Duration: 15 minutes 15 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences:

Trees are a crucial concept in discrete mathematics and computer science, with applications in hierarchical data representation, efficient data structures, algorithm design, database management, artificial intelligence, computational biology, and network design.

A tree is defined as a connected, acyclic graph with n vertices that has n-1 edges. A rooted tree is a tree with one designated root node, where every node (except the root) has exactly one parent.

There are several components of trees: the root is the topmost node, leaves are nodes with no children, and internal nodes have at least one child. The height of a tree is the length of the longest path from the root to a leaf, while depth or level refers to the number of edges from the root to a node.

Binary trees are characterized by each node having at most two children (left and right). Binary search trees (BSTs) are binary trees with the property that the left child's value is less than the parent's value and the right child's value is greater.

Balanced trees maintain a balanced height to ensure efficient operations. The sum of degrees of all vertices in a tree is 2(n-1), where n is the number of vertices. A tree with n vertices has n-1 edges.

Understanding these concepts allows students to analyze and work with various types of trees, implement efficient algorithms, and apply them to solve real-world problems. Regularly assessing understanding and capabilities against learning outcomes is crucial as the course progresses.

To improve understanding, students should review course materials and textbooks, seek additional resources, practice problems or exercises, seek help from instructors or peers, and schedule additional study sessions. Implementing an action plan and regularly reviewing progress will help adjust strategies as needed based on ongoing self-assessment and new feedback.

### Topic 9 introduction Video• . Duration: 2 minutes 2 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

A new topic called relations will be introduced, which will cover relationships between living or nonliving things. In mathematics, a relation refers to a connection between two elements, such as the relationship between a positive integer and an integer it divides. Relations can also be defined between two real numbers or between a real number x and the value of f(x) where f is a function. Mathematically, relations are used to study relationships between sets and their properties. The concept of relations in mathematics was introduced in this video lecture, which will be further discussed in the next lecture. Relations can be defined between two elements of the same set or between two different sets. In mathematics, we can use various methods to represent relations, such as matrices and graphs. The matrix representation of a relation is a square matrix where each entry represents a relationship between two elements. Graph representations of a relation are also used to visualize relationships between sets. There are several properties of relations, including reflexive, symmetric, anti-symmetric, and transitive. Reflexivity means that every element is related to itself, symmetry means that if one element is related to another, then the other element is also related to it, and anti-symmetry means that if one element is related to another, then they cannot be equal. Transitivity means that if two elements are related to a third element, then those two elements must also be related to each other. The properties of relations will be discussed in more detail in future lectures. Relations have various applications in computer science, such as between a computer language and a valid statement in the language. Understanding relations is essential for studying mathematics and its many applications.

### Definition of a relation: relation versus function Video• . Duration: 8 minutes 8 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

A relation between elements of two sets A and B can be defined as a link or connection between an element of set A to an element of set B. The relation R linking elements of set A to elements of set B is denoted by xRy, where x is related to y. The Cartesian product of two sets A and B, written as AxB, is a set of pairs (x,y) such that x is an element of set A and y is an element of set B. A binary relation from a set A to a set B is a subset of the Cartesian product AxB. The pair (x,y) is an element of R if and only if x is related to y. When the sets A and B are the same, we talk about a relation on the set A. In this case, a relation R and the set A is denoted by RxA. A relation can be defined between elements of the same set. For example, let R be a relation on the set A given x,y element of the set A, x is related to y if and only if x is strictly less than y. The relation R on the set A can be represented as a set of pairs (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), and (3, 4). A relation is reflexive if every element of the set is related to itself. A relation is symmetric if for every x in the set A, if x is related to y, then y is also related to x. A relation is anti-symmetric if for every x in the set A, if x is related to y and y is related to x, then x = y.

The Cartesian product of two sets A and B can be calculated using the formula: aAxB = {(a,b) | a ∈ A, b ∈ B}. The relation R on the set A can be represented in matrix form as:

```
| 1  2  3
|------------------
| 0  1  0
| 1  0  1
| 0  1  0
```

The relation R on the set A can also be represented graphically using a directed graph, where each element of the set is connected to every other element in the set.

### Matrix and graph representations of a relation Video• . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

A relation R can be represented using matrices, where the matrix M_r has dimensions n_a x n_b, with element M_ij equal to one if a_i is related to b_j and zero otherwise. The set A contains elements {1, 2, 3, 4} and the set B contains elements {CS100, CS101, CS102, CS103}. The relation R can be represented by a matrix where the element at row i and column j represents the relationship between student i and course j. The union of two relations is a new set that contains all pairs of elements in at least one of the original relations, while the intersection contains only those pairs present in both relations. The union of two relations can be calculated using the joint (i.e., element-wise OR) of the matrices representing R and S, and the intersection can be calculated using the meet (element-wise AND). A relation on a set A can also be represented by a digraph, where an arrow from x to y indicates that x is related to y. The digraph for the relation "divides" on the set {1, 2, 3, 4} shows loops at each vertex indicating self-relations and other edges representing divisibility relations. Similarly, the digraph for the relation "less than or equal to" on the same set shows loops at each vertex and edges representing the relation between elements. In contrast, the digraph for the strictly less than relation has no loops because an element is not related to itself. The properties of a relation, including reflexivity, symmetry, anti-symmetry, transitivity, are also discussed in this lecture.

Overall, the text discusses three ways to represent relations: using matrices, directed graphs (digraphs), and explaining key concepts such as union, intersection, reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity. The examples provided illustrate how these methods can be used to model different types of relationships between sets and elements.

### The properties of a relation: reflexive, symmetric and anti-symmetric Video• . Duration: 14 minutes 14 min

It appears that the provided text is not a complete solution to a problem, but rather a transcript of a lecture or presentation on "Properties of Relations" in mathematics. The text outlines the concepts of reflexivity, symmetry, and anti-symmetry, as well as their graphical representations using matrices and digraphs.

There is no specific problem or question being addressed in the provided text, and it does not contain step-by-step solutions or answers to a particular problem. However, I can provide a summary of the key points discussed in the lecture:

1. Definition of a relation: A relation between two sets is a subset of their Cartesian product.
2. Properties of relations:
	* Reflexivity: A relation R on a set A is reflexive if for all x in A, (x, x) is in R.
	* Symmetry: A relation R on a set A is symmetric if for all x and y in A, if (x, y) is in R, then (y, x) is also in R.

### Relation properties: transitivity Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

A relation R on a set S is transitive if for all a, b, c in S, if a is related to b and b is related to c, then a must be related to c. This concept is essential in graph theory, where the digraph of a relation represents the pairs (a, b) such that a is related to b. The transitive closure of a relation R on S is the smallest transitive relation that contains R.

To determine if a relation is transitive, one can examine its digraph and add edges as necessary to ensure that the resulting graph is transitive. For example, in the case of the relation defined by x ≤ y on N, we can see that it is indeed transitive since x ≤ y and y ≤ z imply x ≤ z.

In contrast, the relation R = {(2, 3), (3, 2), (2, 2)} is not transitive because three is related to two, but two is related to three, while three is not related to three. This implies that adding edges to the digraph will make it transitive.

To find the minimum number of edges needed to add to a relation to make it transitive, we can analyze the digraph and identify any missing connections. For instance, in the case of the relation R on S with the given digraph, we need to add edges (a, c), (b, d), and (a, d) to make it transitive.

The enhanced relation obtained by adding these edges is called the transitive closure of the original relation. This concept is crucial in graph theory, as it allows us to analyze and understand the behavior of relations on graphs.

In conclusion, transitivity is a fundamental property of relations that ensures that if two elements are related through an intermediate element, then they are also directly related. Understanding transitivity is essential for analyzing and manipulating relations in various contexts.

The process of finding the transitive closure of a relation involves examining its digraph and adding edges as necessary to ensure transitivity. This can be a complex task, but it provides valuable insights into the structure and behavior of relations on graphs.

Overall, the concept of transitivity is a key aspect of graph theory, and understanding it is essential for analyzing and manipulating relations in various contexts.

## Week 18

### Equivalence relations and equivalence classes Video• . Duration: 6 minutes 6 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving all key information, formulae, and technical details:

An equivalence relation on a set S is defined as a relation R that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. The relation R is reflexive if for all a in S, a is related to a. The relation R is symmetric if for all a and b in S, if a is related to b then b is also related to a. The relation R is transitive if for all a, b, and c in S, if a is related to b and b is related to c then a is also related to c.

An example of an equivalence relation on the set Z is the relation R where two elements a and b are related if and only if a modulus 2 is equal to b modulus 2. This relation is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive, making it an equivalence relation.

On the other hand, an example of a relation that is not an equivalence relation is the relation R on Z where two elements a and b are related if and only if a is less than or equal to b. This relation is reflexive but not symmetric, as there exist pairs (a, b) such that a is related to b but not vice versa.

The concept of equivalence classes is introduced for an equivalence relation R on a set S. The equivalence class of an element a in S is the subset of S containing all elements related to a through the relation R. For example, in the relation R where two elements are related if and only if they have the same modulus 2, the equivalence classes are {1} and {3}, as well as {2} and {4}.

In another example, the relation R on Z where two elements are related if and only if their difference is an even number results in two equivalence classes: {1, 3, 5} and {2, 4}.

### Partial and total order Video• . Duration: 6 minutes 6 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

A relation R on elements in a set S is said to be a partial order if it satisfies three properties: reflexivity, anti-symmetry, and transitivity. A relation R is reflexive if for all a in S, the pair (a, a) is an element of R. A relation R is anti-symmetric if whenever a is related to b and b is related to a, then a is equal to b for all a and b in S. A relation R is transitive if whenever a is related to b and b is related to c, then a is related to c for all a, b, and c in S.

The relation "less than or equal to" on the set of integers Z is an example of a partial order because it satisfies these three properties. Another example is the relation "divides" on the set of positive integers Z+, which also satisfies these properties.

A total order is defined as a partial order where for all pairs (a, b) in S, either a is related to b or b is related to a. This means that every two elements in the set can be compared with respect to the relation. The relation "less than or equal to" on Z is an example of a total order.

However, not every partial order is a total order. For example, the relation "divides" on Z+ is a partial order but not a total order because there are elements that are incomparable with respect to this relation.

In summary, a partial order and a total order are two different types of relations on a set, where a partial order satisfies reflexivity, anti-symmetry, and transitivity, while a total order adds the condition that every two elements can be compared.

### The pigeonhole principle Video• . Duration: 7 minutes 7 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

The Pigeonhole Principle is a fundamental concept in mathematics that states if K+1 objects are placed into K boxes, then at least one box contains two or more objects. This can be proved by contra-positive, where assuming none of the boxes has more than one object leads to a contradiction with the initial statement. The basic version of the principle can be stated as: "If K+1 objects are placed into K boxes, then at least one box contains two or more objects."

To demonstrate this principle, consider a flock of 10 pigeons and 9 pigeonholes. One pigeonhole contains two pigeons, while the other eight contain one each. This illustrates how the principle can be applied to real-life scenarios.

The Pigeonhole Principle can also be used to prove that if a function F has K+1 elements in its domain and K elements in its co-domain, then it is not a one-to-one function. By creating boxes for each element of the co-domain and placing all elements from the domain into these boxes, we can show that at least one box contains two or more elements.

A generalized version of the Pigeonhole Principle states that if N objects are placed into K boxes, then there is at least one box containing at least the ceiling of N over K objects. This can be proved by contra-positive as well.

To apply this principle to a real-world problem, consider selecting cards from a standard deck of 52 cards to guarantee that at least four cards of the same suit are chosen. Using the generalized version of the Pigeonhole Principle, we can show that if N is the number of cards selected, then at least one box (suit) contains at least four cards.

The smallest value of N that satisfies this condition is 13, meaning we need to select a minimum of 13 cards to ensure that at least four cards of the same suit are chosen.

### Permutations and combinations Video• . Duration: 9 minutes 9 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

A counting problem can be solved by finding the number of ways to arrange distinct elements in a set of a particular size. Permutations involve arranging objects in order, while combinations involve unordered selections. The number of r-permutations of a set with n elements is denoted by P(n,r), which equals n factorial divided by (n-r) factorial.

The formula for permutations can be proven using the product rule, where there are n choices for the first element, n-1 choices for the second element, and so on. This results in n! / (n-r)! possible permutations.

Combinations, on the other hand, involve unordered selections of r elements from a set of n distinct elements. The number of r-combinations is denoted by C(n,r), which equals n factorial divided by r factorial times (n-r) factorial.

The notation "n choose r" refers to the binomial coefficient and represents the number of r-combinations from a set of n elements. This can also be calculated as n! / ((n-r)!r!).

To find the number of all permutations of a set with n elements, we use the formula P(n,r) = n! / (n-r)!. For example, to find the number of three permutations of a set with 50 elements, we calculate 50! / (50-3)!.

In the problem of selecting a first prize winner, second prize winner, and third prize winner from 50 different people, we need to find the number of three permutations. This equals 50! / (50-3)! = 117,600 possible ways.

The order of objects in selections is important in permutations but not in combinations. In the scenario of choosing six players from a tennis team with 20 members, we want to find the number of six combinations. Using the formula C(n,r), this equals 20! / (6!(20-6)!) = 38,760.

In summary, permutations involve ordered arrangements while combinations involve unordered selections. The formulas for permutations and combinations are n! / (n-r)! for r-permutations and n! / ((n-r)!r!) for r-combinations.

### The representation of a set using Venn diagrams Video• . Duration: 4 minutes 4 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

The Venn diagram is a graphical representation used to visualize the possible relations among a collection of sets. The universal set (U) contains everything, and a set A is a subset of U. The Venn diagram represents A as an area in red within U. Given a set A, its complement (A') is a set containing all elements in U not in A, represented by the area outside A in the Venn diagram. The union of A and A' is always equal to the universal set U. Venn diagrams can also represent the intersection of two sets A and B as an overlapping area, and their symmetric difference as the area in red representing all elements in either A or B but not both. To show that two sets are identical, one can draw a Venn diagram for each set and compare them. The symmetric difference of A and B is equal to the union of A and B minus the intersection of A and B. This concept can be demonstrated using Venn diagrams by comparing areas representing different operations. De Morgan's laws state that (A ∩ B)' = A' ∪ B' and (A ∪ B)' = A' ∩ B', which can be visualized in a Venn diagram. The commutative, associative, and distributive laws of sets also have graphical representations using Venn diagrams. Additionally, the concept of partitioning a set into smaller subsets can be represented graphically with Venn diagrams. Review resources are available to help students further understand these concepts. A summative assessment will evaluate students' understanding of these key concepts.

Note: Some technical details and specific examples were omitted from the summary to maintain conciseness, while still preserving the essential information and key findings.

### De Morgan's laws Video• . Duration: 8 minutes 8 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Augustus De Morgan was a British mathematician who formulated De Morgan's laws, which describe the relationship between mathematical statements and their opposites.

De Morgan's laws are applicable to sets, propositions, and logic gates, and their structure is always the same.

The first law states that the complement of the union of two sets is equal to the intersection of their complements: A ∩ B' = (A' ∪ B')'.

The second law states that the complement of the intersection of two sets is equal to the union of their complements: A ∪ B' = (A' ∩ B').

De Morgan's laws can be proven using membership tables and Venn diagrams. The first law can be demonstrated by building a membership table showing that the columns corresponding to the complement of the union and the intersection of the complements are identical.

The second law can also be proven using a membership table, as the column corresponding to the complement of the intersection is equal to the column corresponding to the union of the complements.

Venn diagrams can be used to visualize De Morgan's laws. The diagram for A ∪ B shows all elements in A or B, while the diagram for A ∩ B' shows all elements not in both A and B.

By examining these Venn diagrams, it is clear that (A' ∪ B') = A ∩ B', demonstrating the first law.

Similarly, the diagram for A ∩ B shows all common elements between A and B, while the diagram for A' ∪ B' shows all elements not in both A and B.

This demonstrates that A ∪ B' = (A' ∩ B'), showing the second law.

De Morgan's laws have practical applications, as illustrated by an example involving subsets of a universal set.

In this example, the complement of A ∪ B is equal to the complement of A intersection the complement of B.

This demonstrates that De Morgan's laws are valid and applicable in real-world scenarios.

Overall, De Morgan's laws provide a fundamental understanding of set relationships and have numerous applications in mathematics and other fields.

### Laws of sets: Commutative, associative and distributives Video• . Duration: 11 minutes 11 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving all key information, formulae, and technical details:

The lecture covers three set identities: commutativity, associativity, and distributivity.

Commutativity refers to an operation where the order of elements does not affect the result. For example, addition and multiplication are commutative operations, while subtraction is not.

The union of two sets A and B is commutative, as A ∪ B = B ∪ A.

However, the set difference is not commutative, as A \ B ≠ B \ A.

Associativity refers to an operation where the order in which elements are combined does not affect the result. The union and intersection of three sets A, B, and C are associative, as (A ∩ B) ∪ C = A ∪ (B ∩ C).

The distributive law states that A \ (B ∪ C) = (A \ B) ∪ (A \ C), which is used to simplify set expressions.

De Morgan's laws state that the complement of a union is equal to the intersection of complements, and vice versa: ¬(A ∪ B) = ¬A ∩ ¬B, and ¬(A ∩ B) = ¬A ∪ ¬B.

The absorption law states that A ∩ (A ∪ B) = A and A ∪ (A ∩ B) = A.

Another set identity is related to complement: the complement of a union of two sets is equal to the intersection of their complements.

Additionally, the complement of an empty set is the universal set, and vice versa.

The complement of a set A is denoted as ¬A, which represents all elements not in A.

To simplify set expressions using set identities, one can apply De Morgan's laws, commutativity, and distributive law.

Set operations include union, intersection, difference, and complement.

The lecture concludes with an overview of the set identities covered in the lesson.

### Partition of a set Video• . Duration: 3 minutes 3 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

A partition of an object is a subdivision into parts that are completely separated from each other yet form the whole object. Data partitioning has various applications in Computer Science, such as big data analysis. Two sets A and B are said to be disjointed if their corresponding intersection is equal to the empty set. This means they have no element in common.

A partition of a set A is a set of subsets A_i of A, where all subsets are disjointed and the union of all subsets is equal to A. The concept of disjoint sets can be visualized using Venn diagrams. For example, the sets A_1 to A_5 are subsets of A, demonstrating that they are disjointed.

The union of all subsets A_i is equal to the set A, which means the collection of subsets is a partition of A. To determine if a collection of subsets is a partition of a given set S, one must check if the union of all subsets is equal to S and if all elements are mutually disjointed.

### Answer to question 8 on the problem sheet Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

The problem presents a set theory exercise involving subsets A, B, and C of a universal set U. The goal is to draw a three-binary digit labeled Venn diagram that divides U into eight disjoint regions.

To accomplish this, each digit represents an element in the corresponding set (A, B, or C). For example, 101 means the element is in both A and C.

The problem provides a membership table for subset X of U and asks to identify its region on the Venn diagram. The region contains elements that are in X, which includes values 001, 100, 101, and 110.

These elements can be described as the union of A and C minus the intersection of B and C. In other words, X = (A ∪ C) - (B ∩ C).

The problem also defines set Y as represented by regions 000, 011, 101, 110, and 111 on the Venn diagram. To describe Y using set notation, we need to understand its relationship with the symmetric difference of A, B, and C.

The symmetric difference of A, B, and C contains elements that are in at least one of them but not all of them. In this case, it includes values 100, 010, and 001.

The complement of the symmetric difference is equal to U minus the symmetric difference of A, B, and C. By taking the complement, we obtain the set Y, which consists of elements 000, 011, 101, 110, and 111.

This relationship holds because the symmetric difference contains only those elements that are not in all three sets (A, B, and C), leaving out the regions where an element belongs to exactly one or two of these sets.

### Answer to question 11 on the problem sheet Video• . Duration: 2 minutes 2 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

The video transcript provides a set theory problem where A = [1, 2] and B = [2, 3]. To solve this, we need to find the powerset of A ∩ B, A ∪ B, and A × B. The intersection of two sets is given by elements that are in both sets, resulting in A ∩ B = [2]. The powerset of A ∩ B includes the empty set and {2}. The union of two sets is given by elements that are in either set, resulting in A ∪ B = [1, 2, 3]. The powerset of A ∪ B includes the empty set and all possible subsets of [1, 2, 3], totaling 7 subsets. The Cartesian product of two sets, A × B, is given by (x, y), where x is from A and y is from B, resulting in A × B = [(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)]. The powerset of A × B includes all possible subsets of the Cartesian product.

### Laws of sets: Commutative, associative and distributives Reading• . Duration: 15 minutes 15 min

## Step 1: Understand the laws of sets and their applications
The problem requires us to simplify a given expression using the laws of sets. The laws of sets are mathematical principles used to manipulate and simplify set operations.

## Step 2: Identify the laws applicable to the given expression
To simplify the expression (A∪B)∩(A∪B c ), we need to apply the distributive law, absorption law, complement law, and double negation law.

## Step 3: Apply the distributive law
First, we distribute the intersection over the union using the distributive law: (A∪B)∩(A∪B c ) = (A∩(A∪B c )) ∪ (B∩(A∪B c ).

## Step 4: Simplify each term
Next, we simplify each term. A∩(A∪B c ) can be simplified using the absorption law, which states that A∩(A∪B) = A.

## Step 5: Apply the distributive law to B
For the second term, B∩(A∪B c ), we apply the distributive law again. However, since (B∩B c ) equals ∅, we need to find an alternative way to simplify this expression.

## Step 6: Simplify using De Morgan's laws and complement law
We use De Morgan's laws to relate the complement of the union of sets to the intersection of their complements. By applying De Morgan's laws, (A∪B) c = A c ∩ B c .

## Step 7: Combine simplified terms
Now we combine the simplified terms. Since B∩(A∪B c ) can be rewritten as B∩(A c ∩B c ), and since B∩B c is a contradiction (∅), this simplifies to just B.

## Step 8: Apply the absorption law
With A from step 4, we can now simplify further using the absorption law. This states that A ∪ (B ∩ A) = A.

## Step 9: Final simplification
Applying the absorption law to our expression gives us A ∪ B ∩ A, which simplifies to just A.


The final answer is: $\boxed{A}$

### Topic 1 summary Reading• . Duration: 15 minutes 15 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Set theory is a fundamental area of mathematics that studies collections of objects, known as sets. It forms the basis for various mathematical disciplines and has applications in computer science, logic, and more. A set is defined as an unordered collection of unique objects, which can be represented using listing methods, set builder notation, or Venn diagrams. The cardinality of a set refers to its size, while a subset of a set is a smaller set that contains some or all elements of the original set. There are different types of sets, including empty sets, finite sets, and infinite sets. The powerset of a set is the collection of all possible subsets. Set operations include union, intersection, symmetric difference, and complement. Laws of set theory, such as commutative laws, associative laws, and distributive laws, govern how these operations work. De Morgan's laws provide additional relationships between sets. To prove a relation between two given sets, one can use the laws of set theory or Venn diagrams. Regular assessment is crucial to ensure understanding against learning outcomes. This exercise helps reflect on learning journey, identify areas for improvement, and develop an action plan. Reviewing course materials, seeking additional resources, practicing problems, and seeking help from instructors or peers are recommended strategies for improvement. Implementing the action plan and regularly reviewing progress are essential steps in continuous learning.

## Week 20

### Binomial coefficients and identities Video• . Duration: 9 minutes 9 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving all key information, formulae, and technical details:

The binomial theorem states that given two variables x and y and a non-negative integer n, then x + y^n = ∑[k=0 to k=n] n choose k times x^k times y^(n-k). This formula allows us to expand binomials of any degree. The coefficient of x^8 times y^7 in the expansion of 3x - y^15 is obtained when k = 8, and is equal to 15 choose 8 times 3^8 times (-1)^7 divided by 8! times 7!. The binomial theorem can also be used to show that 2^n = ∑[k=0 to k=n] n choose k. This result follows from applying the binomial theorem with x = 1 and y = 1. Another application of the binomial theorem is to find the number of subsets of a set with n elements, which is equal to 2^n. Pascal's identity states that given two integers n and k with n ≥ k ≥ 1, then n choose k + n choose k-1 is equal to (n+1) choose k. This identity can be used to simplify complicated binomial coefficients. Pascal's triangle is a number triangle with numbers arranged in staggered rows such that the element at row r and column n is the binomial coefficient of n choose r. The result of adding two adjacent binomial coefficients in this triangle is the binomial coefficient in the next row between these two coefficients.

### Generalised permutations and combinations Video• . Duration: 11 minutes 11 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

1. The lecture discusses generalist permutations and combinations, covering both with and without repetition.
2. Permutations with repetition involve selecting r objects from a set of n objects where repetition is allowed, resulting in n^r possible permutations.
3. To prove this, we use the product rule, multiplying n possibilities for each object selection together.
4. For example, if we want to form strings of length r using only uppercase letters in the English alphabet (26 letters), the number of such strings is 26^r.
5. Permutations without repetition involve selecting r objects from a set of n objects where repetition is not allowed, resulting in n! / (n-r)! possible permutations.
6. This can be thought of as distributing r identical balls into n distinct boxes where each box receives at most one ball.
7. Combinations with repetition involve selecting k objects from a set of n objects where repetition is allowed, resulting in (n+k-1) choose K possible combinations.
8. This is equivalent to putting k identical balls into n distinct boxes or finding the number of functions from a set of k identical elements to a set of n distinct elements.
9. Combinations without repetition involve selecting k objects from a set of n objects where repetition is not allowed, resulting in n! / (n-k)! possible combinations.
10. This can be thought of as distributing k identical balls into n distinct boxes where each box receives at most one ball or finding the number of 1-1 functions from a set of k identical elements to a set of n distinct elements.
11. The formulae for permutations and combinations are summarized in the table:
	* Permutations with repetition: n^r
	* Permutations without repetition: n! / (n-r)!
	* Combinations with repetition: (n+k-1) choose K
	* Combinations without repetition: n! / (n-k)!
12. The lecture also discusses generalized permutations and combinations, distinguishable objects and boxes, and binomial coefficients.
13. Generalized permutations involve selecting r objects from a set of n objects where order matters and repetition is allowed or not allowed.
14. Distinguishable objects and boxes refer to scenarios where the order of selection matters and repetition is allowed or not allowed.
15. Binomial coefficients are used in various combinatorial problems, such as distributing identical balls into distinct boxes or finding the number of functions between sets.

### Distinguishable objects and boxes Video• . Duration: 9 minutes 9 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Counting problems can be reduced to finding the number of ways objects can be placed into boxes. The objects can be either distinguishable or indistinguishable, and the boxes can also be distinguishable or indistinguishable. Counting problems can take place with exclusion or without exclusion, where exclusion means no box can contain more than one object.

When placing distinguishable balls into distinguishable boxes with exclusion, it is equivalent to forming an unordered selection of k boxes from n available boxes. The number of ways of distributing k distinguishable balls into n distinguishable boxes with exclusion is equal to n factorial over n minus k factorial (n! / (n-k)!).

Without exclusion, the distribution is equivalent to making an ordered selection of k boxes from n boxes with repetition, and the number of ways is n to the power of k (n^k). When placing indistinguishable balls into distinguishable boxes with exclusion, it is equivalent to forming a combination of size k from a set of size n, resulting in n factorial over k factorial times n minus k factorial.

Without exclusion for indistinguishable balls, it is equivalent to forming a combination of size k from a set of size n with repetition, giving (n+k-1) factorial over k factorial times n minus 1 factorial. The problem of distributing eight indistinguishable balls into six distinguishable boxes is equivalent to choosing an unordered selection of 8 items from a set of 6 elements when repetition is permitted.

The number of ways to distribute eight indistinguishable balls into six distinguishable boxes equals 13 choose 8, which is equal to 1,287. The lecture discussed how counting problems can be modeled by distributing objects into boxes and looked at various scenarios with exclusion or without exclusion for both distinguishable and indistinguishable objects.

### Binomial coefficients and identities Reading• . Duration: 15 minutes 15 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Binomial coefficients represent the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements without regard to order. They are defined as: (k n) = k!(n-k)! / n!. This definition is essential in combinatorics and algebra, with numerous applications in probability, statistics, and algebra.

The binomial coefficient has two properties: symmetry and Pascal's rule. Symmetry states that (k n) = (n-k n), reflecting the equivalence of choosing k elements from n elements versus leaving out n-k elements. Pascal's rule states that (k n) = (k-1 n-1) + (k n-1), derived from considering whether a particular element is included in the subset or not.

The binomial theorem describes the expansion of a binomial raised to any positive integer power: (x+y)^n = ∑[k=0,n] (k n)x^(n-k)y^k. This theorem expresses the coefficients in the expansion as binomial coefficients.

Binomial coefficients are central to combinatorics and algebra, providing tools for counting, probability, and algebraic manipulations. The properties of binomial coefficients, including symmetry and Pascal's rule, make them a fundamental concept in mathematics.

In conclusion, binomial coefficients and their identities are essential for solving problems in combinatorics and algebra, with numerous applications across various fields of study. Understanding the definition, properties, and identities of binomial coefficients is crucial for working in these areas.

Combinatorics is a branch of mathematics that focuses on counting, arranging, and combining elements in sets, with applications in computer science, probability, statistics, and optimization. The field covers basic counting principles, including the addition principle and multiplication principle. Permutations refer to the arrangement of n elements in a specific order, with formulas P(n) = n! and P(n,r) = (n-r)!n!. Combinations refer to the selection of n elements without regard to order, with the formula C(n,r) = r!(n-r)!n!.

The binomial theorem expands expressions of the form (x+y)^n, using coefficients known as binomial coefficients. These coefficients represent the number of ways to choose k elements from n elements. The pigeonhole principle states that if n items are put into m containers and n>m, then at least one container must contain more than one item.

Combinatorics provides a mathematical foundation for counting, arranging, and analyzing sets and sequences. It is an essential tool in many areas of mathematics and applied sciences. Regularly assessing understanding against learning outcomes is crucial as students progress through their course. This exercise aims to help reflect on learning journeys, identify knowledge gaps, and develop improvement plans.

The exercise consists of several steps: reviewing learning outcomes, rating understanding (1-5), identifying areas for improvement, creating an action plan, and implementing it. The action plan may involve reviewing course materials, seeking additional resources, practicing problems, seeking instructor or peer help, scheduling study sessions, and adjusting strategies as needed. Combinatorics is a continuous process of learning, and revising plans to better suit needs is encouraged.

The module summary covers key concepts in combinatorics, including basic counting principles, permutations, combinations, binomial theorem, and pigeonhole principle. The exercise aims to help students identify areas for improvement and develop a plan to address these gaps.

## Week 3

### Topic 2 introduction Video• . Duration: 1 minute 1 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

A function is a rule that relates one quantity to another, where each input maps to exactly one output. Functions are a fundamental concept in computer programming and are used extensively in writing programs. A plant's growth, for example, depends on factors such as sunlight and rainfall, while a runner's speed depends on the time taken to run a distance. Voltage is also dependent on resistance and electric current.

In mathematics, functions are used to model relationships between variables. The concept of a function is central to computer programming and most programs consist of functions that work together to achieve a goal. To be considered a valid function, it must satisfy certain properties, including being one-to-one (injective) or onto (surjective).

Injective functions map each input to exactly one output, while surjective functions ensure every output has at least one corresponding input. Functions can also be categorized as even or odd based on their behavior under symmetry operations.

In this topic, we will introduce functions and examine various properties, including plotting functions, injective and surjective functions, and more. We will explore how functions are used in computer programming and review essential reading material. The goal of this topic is to provide a comprehensive understanding of functions and their applications in mathematics and computer science.

Overall, functions play a crucial role in modeling relationships between variables and are an essential tool for problem-solving in both mathematics and computer programming.

### The definition of a function Video• . Duration: 11 minutes 11 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

A function is a relation between a set of inputs (called the domain) and a set of outputs (called the co-domain). The output for each input is unique. A function can be represented as f(x), where x is an element of the domain and f(x) is an element of the co-domain.

The range of a function is the subset of the co-domain that contains all possible outputs of the function. To find the range, we need to determine the set of values that the output takes for each input.

To find the pre-image of an element in the co-domain, we need to find the input that produces that output. In other words, we need to solve the equation f(x) = y for x.

A function can be injective (one-to-one), meaning that no two different inputs produce the same output. A function can also be surjective (onto), meaning that every element in the co-domain has a corresponding input in the domain.

For example, consider the function f: Z -> Z defined by f(x) = |x|. The domain of this function is all integers, and the range is all non-negative integers. To find the pre-image of 1, we need to solve |x| = 1 for x, which gives us x = -1 or x = 1.

In summary, a function is a relation between two sets that assigns each element of one set to exactly one element of another set. The range of a function is the subset of the co-domain that contains all possible outputs, and the pre-image of an element in the co-domain is the input that produces that output.

Here are some key points to take away from this lesson:

* Definition of a function
* Finding the domain, co-domain, and range of a function
* Pre-images of elements in the co-domain
* Injective and surjective functions

To practice what you have learned, try completing the exercises provided in the video.

### Plotting functions Video• . Duration: 9 minutes 9 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

A function f is called linear if it is of the form f(x) = ax + b, where a and b are real numbers. The gradient of the function f, a, determines whether the function is increasing or decreasing. If a is positive, the function is increasing, and if a is negative, the function is decreasing.

A quadratic function is of the form f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c, where a, b, and c are real numbers and a ≠ 0. The graph of a quadratic function is a parabola that opens upwards or downwards depending on the value of a.

An exponential function is of the form f(x) = b^x, where b > 0 and b ≠ 1. The variable b is called the base of the function.

The laws of exponential functions include:

* b^x * b^y = b^(x+y)
* b^x / b^y = b^(x-y)
* (b^x) * y = b^((x)y)
* a * b^x = (a*b)^x
* a/b^x = a/(b^x)

If the base b is greater than 1, the function is increasing and represents growth. If the base b is less than 1, the function is decreasing and represents decay.

The domain of an exponential function is the set of all real numbers. The range of an exponential function depends on the value of the base and can be the set of all positive real numbers or other intervals.

This transcript appears to be a lecture on functions, specifically focusing on injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto) properties of functions. The speaker guides the audience through several key concepts and provides examples to illustrate these ideas.

Here are the main points covered in this lecture:

1. **Definition of Functions**: The lecturer emphasizes that for every input in a function, there is exactly one output. This is crucial for defining what constitutes a valid function.
2. **Injective (One-to-One) Functions**: Injective functions are those where each element in the domain maps to a unique element in the range. The speaker provides examples of injective functions and highlights their key characteristics, including that no two different elements in the domain map to the same element in the range.
3. **Surjective (Onto) Functions**: Surjective functions are those where every element in the co-domain is mapped by at least one element from the domain. The speaker discusses how surjectivity ensures that every possible output value is covered, making it useful for applications involving exhaustive coverage of all possibilities.

The lecture also includes several practical exercises and video segments to reinforce understanding through examples:

### Injective and surjective functions Reading• . Duration: 15 minutes 15 min

## Step 1: Understanding Injective Functions
An injective function, also known as a one-to-one function, is a function where every element of the codomain is mapped to at most one element from the domain.

## Step 2: Understanding Surjective Functions
A surjective function, also known as an onto function, is a function where every element in the codomain is mapped by at least one element from the domain.

## Step 3: Understanding Bijective Functions
A bijective function is both injective and surjective. This means that every element in the codomain is mapped to exactly one element from the domain.

## Step 4: Analyzing Examples of Injective, Surjective, and Bijective Functions
We can analyze examples such as f(1)=a, f(2)=b, f(3)=c for injectivity, g(1)=a, g(2)=a, g(3)=b for non-injectivity, h(1)=a, h(2)=b, h(3)=c for surjectivity, and i(1)=a, i(2)=b, i(3)=c for bijectivity.

## Step 5: Drawing Conclusions
From the analysis of examples, we can conclude that injective functions map each element in the domain to at most one element in the codomain, surjective functions map each element in the codomain to at least one element in the domain, and bijective functions are both injective and surjective.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$

## Week 4

### Function composition Video• . Duration: 4 minutes 4 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The lecture discusses function composition, which involves combining two functions F and G to create a new function F ∘ G. The output of F ∘ G can be calculated in two stages: first, input X into G to get G(X), then use G(X) as an input into F to get F(G(X)). An example illustrates this concept, where F doubles the input and G squares it; applying them together results in a function that doubles the square of the input. Function composition can be visualized using three sets A, B, and C, with functions G and F mapping between them. This visualization demonstrates how F ∘ G applies first to an element in A and then maps the result through F, resulting in an output in set C. The lecture provides an example of two functions F and G defined over the same domain and codomain (R), where F(x) = 2x + 3 and G(x) = 3x + 2. To illustrate function composition, we apply these functions to an element of R, say "1". First, applying G(1) gives us 5, then applying F(5) gives us 13. This example demonstrates that F ∘ G is not the same as G ∘ F, meaning that the order of composition matters.

In general, when composing two functions F and G, the output of G becomes the input to F, resulting in a new function F ∘ G. The function composition relation is not commutative, meaning that reversing the order of composition changes the result.

This lecture introduces function composition as an essential concept for understanding many mathematical and real-world applications.

### Logarithmic functions Video• . Duration: 12 minutes 12 min

Here is a summary of the text in 5 paragraphs:

The lecture discusses two fundamental concepts in mathematics: exponential functions and logarithmic functions. Exponential functions are introduced as functions that grow or decrease continuously, whereas logarithmic functions are defined as inverse operations to exponential functions.

The lecture introduces logarithmic functions with any base, but focuses on common bases such as the natural logarithm (ln x) with a base of e = 2.71828. The properties of logarithmic functions, including their graphs and domains, are discussed. It is explained that logarithmic functions have an increasing trend when the base is greater than 1, while decreasing when the base is less than 1.

The relationship between exponential and logarithmic functions is emphasized as they are inverse operations. This means that if we take a function f(x) = e^x (exponential), its inverse is log(x) (logarithm). The graphs of exponential and logarithmic functions are also shown to be symmetric with respect to the line y = x.

Logarithmic functions have several important properties, including intercepting the x-axis at 1,0. The domains and ranges of logarithmic functions are discussed in detail. It is explained that logarithmic functions are increasing when the base is greater than 1, while decreasing when the base is less than 1.

The lecture concludes by discussing natural logarithms (ln x) with a base of e = 2.71828, which have several unique properties. The graph of the natural logarithm function is shown to be an increasing curve that passes through the point (e, 1).

### The floor and ceiling functions Video• . Duration: 12 minutes 12 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

The floor function is defined as a function from R to Z that takes a real number x as input and gives output the largest integer less than or equal to x. The ceiling function is also defined as a function from R to Z that takes a real number x as input and gives output the smallest integer greater than or equal to x.

The floor function rounds down a real number, while the ceiling function rounds up a real number.

For example, given an integer n, if n is less than or equal to x, and x is strictly less than n plus 1, then the floor of x is equal to n. Similarly, for negative numbers, if x is between two integers, the floor of x will be the lower integer.

The ceiling function rounds up a real number to the nearest integer. For example, given an integer n, if n is greater than or equal to x, and x is strictly less than n minus 1, then the ceiling of x is equal to n.

To prove that the floor function satisfies certain properties, let m be an integer and assume that the floor of x is equal to m. Adding n to both sides of this inequality yields the result that the floor of x plus n equals the floor of x on its own plus n.

The ceiling function also has similar properties.

### Answer to question 1 on the problem sheet Video• . Duration: 7 minutes 7 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

The video transcript discusses functions A, B, and C, as well as two functions f and g that map between these sets. The domain of a function is the set of all inputs, while the co-domain is the set of all possible outputs. The range of a function is the set of all actual outputs. Function f maps set A to set B, with a table defining the mapping: x = 1 => f(x) = a, x = 2 => f(x) = b, etc. Similarly, function g maps set B to set C: x = a => g(x) = w, x = b => g(x) = x, etc. The domain of f is {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, the co-domain is {a, b, c, d}, and the range is also {a, b, c, d}. For function g, the domain is {a, b, c, d} and the range is {w, x, y, z}. To find f(1), we look at the table and see that f(1) = a. The pre-image of d under function f is {5, 6}, as both are mapped to d. Finally, g(f(3)) = g(a) = w. Function f is not one-to-one because multiple inputs map to the same output (d = 5 and d = 6). However, function f is onto because every element in the co-domain has a pre-image. To show that g is both one-to-one and onto, we can see from the arrow diagram that each element in the range has a unique pre-image, making g one-to-one. Additionally, since the range equals the co-domain, g is also onto.

### Answer to question 7 on the problem sheet Video• . Duration: 3 minutes 3 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

The floor function F(X) is defined as the largest integer less than or equal to X, where f maps real numbers to integers. The graph of F(X) for X in the interval from -3 to 3 is plotted. To find the floor of π, which is between 3 and 4, we get 3; for -2.5, we get -3; and for -1, we get -1. The function F is not injective because each element of its range has more than one pre-image, such as the case where the floor of 2.5 equals both 2 and 2.1. However, it is bijective (onto) since every element of its codomain has a pre-image on the floor function.

Furthermore, the graph shows that F(X) = -3 for multiple values of X. For example, floor(2.5), floor(-0.5), and floor(4) all yield 2. Since there is no real number such that the floor function equals only one value in the codomain (negative integers), the set {n ∈ ℤ: n ≥ -3} has an infinite number of elements and cannot be exactly equal to any integer; therefore, F(X) = n ≠ for all n > -3. The solution is also proven using logical reasoning.

In conclusion, while the floor function maps real numbers into integers (but doesn't always map one-to-one), it does provide every integer in its codomain with pre images: there are values that take the same output on both sides; therefore it can be said to be a bijective function.

10. Function composition is denoted as (f∘g)=f(g()), where f and g are functions in the same domain and range.

Some specific functions that need understanding include:

11. Linear functions: f(x) = mx + b, where m and b are constants.
12. Quadratic functions: f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c, where a, b, and c are constants.
13. Ceiling function: ⌈x⌉ = the smallest integer greater than or equal to x.
14. Floor function: ⌊x⌋ = the largest integer less than or equal to x.
15. Exponential function: f(x) = e^x, where e is a base constant.

The learning exercise aims to help students reflect on their understanding of functions and identify areas for improvement by rating their knowledge against the learning outcomes and creating an action plan to address any gaps in their understanding.

## Week 5

### Introduction to propositional logic Video• . Duration: 2 minutes 2 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

Propositional logic is a branch of logic that studies mathematical statements, dating back to Aristotle's original purpose. It serves as the basis for reasoning and rules in constructing mathematical theories. Propositional logic is an algebra of propositions, where variables represent unknown propositions rather than unknown real numbers. The operators used are: ∧ (and), ∨ (or), ¬ (not), → (implies), and ⇔ (if and only if). This form of logic can be applied to computer circuit design and programming languages like Prolog. Prolog is a language that uses predicate logic, a more powerful form of logic that extends propositional logic. Predicate logic will be explored in the next topic. Propositional logic is used in systems for reasoning by computers, including theorem provers, program verifiers, and applications in artificial intelligence. The use of logical statements allows for efficient processing of information and validation of assumptions. Truth tables and truth sets are essential tools in propositional logic, enabling the evaluation of compound propositions. Compound propositions combine simple propositions using logical operators to form more complex statements. Understanding logical statements is crucial for effective reasoning and problem-solving in computer science and other fields. The properties of propositional logic include distributivity, associativity, and commutativity, which govern how logical operators interact with one another. Propositional logic has numerous applications, including programming languages, artificial intelligence, and computer circuit design. By mastering propositional logic, individuals can develop a solid foundation for reasoning and problem-solving in a variety of contexts.

### Truth tables and truth sets Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

A truth table is a tabular representation of all possible combinations of its propositional variables. To construct a truth table for n propositional variables, create a table with 2^n rows and n columns. Fill the columns with all possible combinations of values, starting with false values. This ensures that every possible combination of the propositional variables is represented.

For example, considering three propositional variables p, q, and r, the resulting truth table would have eight rows, representing all possible combinations of these variables. Each column represents a propositional variable, alternating between true and false values to cover all possibilities.

A truth set is defined as the set of elements from a set S for which a proposition is true. For instance, if p is the proposition "n is even" on the set of integers from 1-10, then the truth set of p is {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}.

In practice, truth sets are denoted using capital letters (e.g., P for the truth set of p). The concept of truth tables and truth sets allows us to systematically determine the truth value of complex propositions. By examining all possible combinations of propositional variables, we can assess the truth value of a proposition in a systematic and objective manner.

The construction of truth tables involves creating a table with n columns, where each column represents a propositional variable, and filling it with alternating true and false values. This ensures that every possible combination of the propositional variables is represented in the table.

Truth sets provide an alternative way to represent the truth value of propositions. By examining the elements of a set S for which a proposition holds true, we can define the truth set of the proposition.

## Week 6

### Logical implication Video• . Duration: 7 minutes 7 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Logical implication is a type of conditional statement that can be defined as "if p then q", where p is called the hypothesis and q is called the conclusion or consequence. The truth table for an implication shows that it is true to think that if the hypothesis is false, then any conclusion can be implied whether it's false or true. There are multiple ways to express conditional statements, such as "if p, then q" or "p only if q". Implication can also be expressed in other forms, including "q follows from p", "p is sufficient for q", and "q unless not p".

The converse of an implication is the proposition "q implies p", while the contrapositive is the proposition "not q implies not p". The inverse of an implication is the proposition "not p implies not q". These three propositions are related to the original implication.

Implication can be used to express statements such as "if it's sunny, then John goes to the park" or "n has one digit if n is less than 10". Symbolic logic expressions for these statements include "p implies q", while English translations may vary depending on the context.

Logical implication is an important concept in computer logic and other areas of mathematics. Understanding logical implication can help individuals develop their critical thinking skills and make informed decisions. The concepts of converse, inverse, and contrapositive are also essential to understanding more advanced topics in propositional logic.

In conclusion, logical implication is a fundamental concept in mathematics and computer science that involves conditional statements and their relationships with other propositions. Understanding the truth table, different expressions for implications, and the concepts of converse, inverse, and contrapositive can help individuals develop a strong foundation in propositional logic.

### Logical equivalence Video• . Duration: 6 minutes 6 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Logical equivalence is a concept in propositional logic where two propositions have the same truth value. The biconditional statement "p if and only if q" is true when p and q have the same truth values and false otherwise. Two propositions are logically equivalent if they always have the same truth value. The symbol "=" is not a logical operator, but rather denotes that two propositions are equivalent. To determine equivalence, one can use truth tables to check whether the two propositions have the same truth values.

For example, the proposition "p implies q" is equivalent to "non-p or q". However, the converse and inverse of an implication are different from the original implication. The precedence order of compound propositions includes implication and equivalence, which updates the table of precedence for logical operators.

Implication and equivalence can be used to simplify complex compound propositions. The biconditional statement "p if and only if q" is a way to express the idea that two propositions are equivalent. Logical equivalence can be proven using truth tables by checking whether the two propositions have the same truth values in all possible cases.

The concept of logical equivalence is important in computer logic, where it can be used to simplify code and improve efficiency. The precedence order of compound propositions ensures that operators are applied in the correct order when simplifying complex expressions.

In summary, logical equivalence is a fundamental concept in propositional logic that allows us to determine whether two propositions have the same truth value. It can be proven using truth tables and has important applications in computer logic.

### Laws of propositional logic Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Propositional logic is an algebra involving multiple laws that enable reasoning and proof of equivalence. The law of idempotence states that p or p is equivalent to p and p and p is equivalent to p. The commutative law states that p or q is equivalent to q or p and p and q is equivalent to q and p. The associative law states that the conjunction and disjunction operators can be distributed over each other. The distributive law states that the order of operators does not matter as long as the sequence remains the same. The identity law states that p or false is equivalent to p and p and true is equivalent to p. The domination law states that p or true is always equivalent to true and p and false is always equivalent to false.

DeMorgan's laws formalize how we negate conjunction and disjunction, ensuring that we change the logical connective after negating a proposition. The Absorption laws state that p or p and q is equivalent to p and p and q or q is equivalent to p. The negation law states that p or not p is always true (tautology) and p and not p is always false. The Double Negation law states that not not p is equivalent to p.

To prove equivalence between two compound propositions, we can use DeMorgan's laws, double negation, distributive laws, and identity laws. For example, the given proposition "not p and not q or q" can be simplified using these laws to arrive at a logically equivalent form "true and not p or not q". This demonstrates how propositional logic laws can be used to simplify complex expressions and prove equivalence between two propositions.

### Answer to question 4 on problem sheet Video• . Duration: 3 minutes 3 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

The first exercise on propositional logic involves using the listing method to specify the truth set corresponding to given statements. The propositions relate to the letter "l" in the word "software". P states that l is a vowel, while q states that l comes after the letter K in the alphabet. To find the truth set of not q, we identify the letters in software that come before K, which are a, e, and f. For p or q, we need to find the letters that are both in the set of vowels (p) and those that come after K (q). The intersection of these sets is {a, e}. To find the truth set of p or q, we combine the set of vowels with those that come after K, resulting in {s, f, t, w, r, o}.

### Answer to question 5 on problem sheet Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Propositional logic is the study of statements that can be either true or false, and how to reason about them using logical operators. Two propositions, p and q, are considered. A truth table is constructed to show the truth value of each logical statement involving p and q. The truth table has at least 2^n rows, where n is the number of propositions. For two propositions, there are 4 possible combinations: 0, 0; 0, 1; 1, 0; and 1, 1. Notation for negation (not) is used to create new columns in the truth table.

The first column represents p, with values 0 and 1. The second column represents q, also with values 0 and 1. The third column represents not p, which is 1 when p is 0, and 0 when p is 1. Similarly, the fourth column represents not q. 

To evaluate the truth value of "p or q", the columns are examined for rows in which either p or q (or both) is true. The first row has neither p nor q true; all other rows have at least one proposition true, so the statement "p or q" is true for those rows.

Similarly, to evaluate the truth value of "p and q", the columns are examined for rows in which both p and q are true. Only the last row meets this condition, so "p and q" is false for that row and true otherwise.

Noting the statement "not p or not q", its truth table is constructed similarly to the others. This statement holds if either not p (and thus) not q is true; only when both are 0 does it hold that the statements are false.

DeMorgan's second law states that "not p or not q" and "not p and not q" are equivalent, meaning they have the same truth values for all combinations of p and q. This equivalence is demonstrated using the truth table.

This summary provides an overview of constructing truth tables for propositional logic statements involving two propositions (p and q), evaluating their truth values, and demonstrating DeMorgan's second law.

### Non-equivalence Reading• . Duration: 15 minutes 15 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences:

To prove that two propositions are equivalent, it suffices to build the truth table for each proposition. If the truth values of the two propositions are the same, then they are equivalent. However, if there is a case where the truth values differ, then the propositions are not equivalent. The truth table for p → q, ¬p → ¬q, and q → p shows that p → q and q → p are not equivalent because their columns have different truth values.

On the other hand, the truth table for q → p and ¬p → ¬q shows that these two propositions are equivalent because their columns have identical truth values. The truth value of a proposition is determined by its definition and the rules of propositional logic.

In general, a proposition p → q is true if and only if either p is false or q is true. This means that if p is true and q is false, then p → q is false. The truth table for p → q shows that this condition holds.

Similarly, ¬p → ¬q is true if and only if either ¬p is false or ¬q is true. This means that if ¬p is true (i.e., p is false) and ¬q is true (i.e., q is false), then ¬p → ¬q is true. The truth table for ¬p → ¬q shows that this condition holds.

In conclusion, the equivalence of two propositions can be determined by building their truth tables and comparing their columns. If the columns are identical, then the propositions are equivalent. If the columns have different truth values, then the propositions are not equivalent.

### Topic 3 summary Reading• . Duration: 15 minutes 15 min

To address this problem, I will provide a step-by-step solution.

## Step 1: Understand the Problem
The problem requires us to construct a truth table for the proposition (p∧q)∨¬r and determine if two given propositions are logically equivalent. Additionally, we need to prove a logical equivalence between the propositions (p∨q)∧(p∨¬q) and p.

## Step 2: Construct the Truth Table
To construct the truth table for (p∧q)∨¬r, we need to create a table with all possible combinations of truth values for p, q, and r. We will then use these truth values to determine the truth value of the proposition (p∧q)∨¬r.

## Step 3: Determine Logical Equivalence
To determine if two propositions are logically equivalent, we need to compare their truth tables. If the truth tables are identical, then the propositions are logically equivalent.

## Step 4: Prove Logical Equivalence
To prove a logical equivalence between two propositions, we can use various methods such as constructing a truth table or using algebraic manipulations.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$

### Introduction to predicate logic Video• . Duration: 1 minute 1 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Predicate logic is a type of logic that overcomes the limitations of propositional logic. It can express complex reasoning and formalize statements with unknown truth values. The two statements "All men are mortal" and "Socrates is a man" cannot be represented by propositional logic alone. However, they can be expressed using predicate logic to build more complex reasoning. For example, if we consider the statement "X squared is equal to 4," it is not a proposition but rather an equation whose truth value depends on X. This type of statement cannot be expressed using propositional logic alone. Predicate logic is able to handle these types of statements and provide a powerful tool for formalizing complex reasoning.

Predicate logic is defined by its use of predicates, which are functions that assign properties to entities. For example, the predicate "is mortal" can be used to assign a property to Socrates in the statement "Socrates is a man." The key properties of predicate logic include:

*   Quantification: the ability to express statements with unknown truth values
*   Nested quantifiers: the use of multiple quantifiers to describe complex relationships between entities
*   Predicates: functions that assign properties to entities

Predicate logic provides a powerful tool for formalizing complex reasoning and expressing statements with unknown truth values. It can be used to build more complex models of reality, including those involving abstract objects and mathematical concepts.

### What are predicates? Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Predicate logic is introduced as a solution to the limitations of propositional logic. Predicates are generalizations of propositions that return true or false values depending on their variables. A predicate can be formalized using a propositional function, which becomes a proposition when its variable(s) are assigned actual values. The statement "x squared is equal to 4" contains two parts: the variable x and the property "squared is equal to four". It can be represented as P of x, where P is the predicate squared is equal to four. When x has specific values, P of x becomes a proposition with a truth value.

Predicates can have multiple parameters, such as the example "x square is greater than y", which is a two-parameter predicate. The statement "2 square is greater than 3" is true, while "2 square is greater than 4" is false. A predicate's truth value depends on its variables and assigned values.

The logical operations from propositional logic can be applied to predicate logic. For instance, "P of x or P of y" is equivalent to "x squared is less than 16 or y squared is less than 16", which is true. However, "P of 1 and P of -5" is not a proposition until y is assigned a value.

Predicate logic provides a solution to the limitations of propositional logic by allowing for generalizations of propositions and functions that return true or false values depending on their variables. This allows for more expressive and flexible logical statements.

### Quantification Video• . Duration: 9 minutes 9 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

The concept of quantifiers in predicate logic expresses the extent to which a predicate is true over a range of elements. Quantification expresses the meaning of words like "all" and "some." The two most important quantifiers are the universal quantifier and the existential quantifier. Universal quantification states that a predicate P of x is true for all values of x in the universe of discourse, denoted as ∀xP(x). Existential quantification states that there exists a value x in the universe of discourse such that P of x is true, denoted as ∃xP(x). The uniqueness quantifier is a special case of existential quantification, stating that there exists a unique value of x such that P of x is true. To express statements using universal and existential quantifiers, we use predicates and the logical operators ∀ and ∃. For example, "for all x and y, x plus y is greater than 10" can be expressed as ∀x∀y(x + y > 10). The existential quantifier works similarly, but with a disjunction operator (∨) instead of conjunction (∧). The uniqueness quantifier states that there exists a unique value of x such that P of x is true. For instance, "there exists a unique x such that x squared is equal to 4" can be expressed as ∃x∀y(x² = y). Quantifiers are essential in predicate logic to express complex statements and relationships between predicates.

### Nested quantifiers Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Nested quantifiers are used to express statements with multiple variables. The meaning of nested quantifiers includes "for all x, for all y, P(x, y)" meaning P(x, y) is true for every pair x, y; "there exists x, there exists y, P(x,y)" meaning there is a pair x,y for which P(x,y) is true; and "for all x there exists y, P(x,y)" meaning that for every x there is a y for which P(x,y) is true. There also exists the statement "there exists x for all y, P(x,y)" meaning that there is an x for which P(x,y) is true for every y. Variables in a predicate can be either bound or free, with a variable being bound if it is within the scope of a quantifier and free if it is not bound by a quantifier or particular value. The Logical operations introduced in propositional logic, including negation, disjunction, conjunction, implication, and equivalence, can also be applied to quantified statements. For example, "there exists x P(x,y)" is equivalent to "P(x) and Q(y)" where P(x) denotes x > 3 and Q(y) denotes y^2 is even. However, the order of nested quantifiers does not matter when they are of the same type (e.g., "for all x, for all y, P(x,y)" is equivalent to "for all y, for all x P(x, y)"). The order of nested quantifiers can change when they are of different types (e.g., "for all x, there exists y, P(x,y)" is not equivalent to "there exists y for all x, P(x,y)"). When simplifying the notation of nested quantifiers, it is essential to maintain consistency in the order of quantifiers. The variables within a predicate can be bound or free, and their relationship affects the meaning of the statement. Nested quantifiers are used to express complex statements with multiple variables, and understanding their properties and relationships is crucial for logical reasoning.

### Nested quantifiers Reading• . Duration: 1 hour 30 minutes 1h 30m

Unfortunately, there is no text provided for me to summarize in 15 sentences. The text appears to be a list of reading assignments, exercises, and videos related to predicate logic, but it does not contain any specific information or concepts that can be summarized.

However, I can provide some general information about the topics mentioned:

Predicate logic is a branch of mathematics that deals with reasoning and argumentation using predicates, which are statements that describe properties or relationships between entities. Quantifiers, such as "for all" and "there exists," are used to express these properties or relationships in formal language.

Logical operators, such as conjunction and disjunction, are used to combine predicates and quantifiers to form more complex statements.

Nested quantifiers refer to the use of quantifiers within themselves, which can lead to complex logical structures.

The texts mentioned (Rosen, 2012, and Koshy, 2004) are likely textbooks or study materials that cover these topics in detail. The exercises listed provide opportunities for practice and reinforcement of the concepts learned from reading the material.

If you could provide a specific text or passage that you would like me to summarize, I would be happy to try and assist you.

## Week 8

### De Morgan's laws for quantifiers Video• . Duration: 6 minutes 6 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

De Morgan's laws are applied to predicate logic to formalize intuitions about negation. The rules for negating quantifiers can be summarized as follows: (1) ¬∀x P(x) ≡ ∃x ¬P(x), where P is a predicate over x; (2) ¬∃x P(x) ≡ ∀x ¬P(x). These laws allow us to formalize intuitions about negation of quantified expressions. The example S, "All university computers are connected to the network," can be expressed as ∀x P(x), where U is students in computer science and p(x) is "x has taken a course in neural networks." The negation of S can be expressed as ¬S ≡ ∃x ¬p(x), meaning there is at least one student who has not taken a course in neural networks. Similarly, the example R, "There is a student of Computer Science who didn't take a course in Machine Learning," can be expressed as ∃x q(x), where U is students in computer science and q(x) denotes "X didn't take a course in machine learning." The negation of R can be expressed as ¬R ≡ ∀x ¬q(x), meaning every student in computer science has taken a course in machine learning. De Morgan's laws can be applied to nested quantifiers by moving the negation through all quantifiers and replacing each "for all" with "there exists" and vice versa. For example, ¬∀x ∃y P(x, y) ≡ ∃x ∀y ¬P(x, y). The application of De Morgan's laws demonstrates how to formalize intuitions about negation in predicate logic.

### Rules of inference Video• . Duration: 15 minutes 15 min

Based on the provided transcript, it appears that the topic is about rules of inference in propositional and predicate logic.

Here's a possible response to the discussion prompt:

**Propositional logic and predicate logic**

To address this question, we need to consider the differences between propositional logic and predicate logic. Propositional logic deals with statements that are either true or false, whereas predicate logic extends this to include variables and predicates that can take on multiple values.

Rules of inference in propositional logic are often based on simple logical operations such as conjunction, disjunction, negation, and implication. In contrast, rules of inference in predicate logic involve more complex operations such as universal instantiation, existential generalization, and modus ponens.

When applying rules of inference, it's essential to carefully analyze the structure of the argument and ensure that the premises logically follow from the conclusion.

Some common mistakes when using rules of inference include:

* Affirming the consequence: incorrectly assuming that a true premise implies a true conclusion.
* Denying the antecedent: incorrectly assuming that if a premise is false, then the consequent is also false.
* Existential fallacy: incorrectly assuming that because an individual exists, they have certain properties or characteristics.

To avoid these mistakes, it's crucial to carefully evaluate the logical connections between premises and conclusions.

**Extra resources**

For further learning on rules of inference, I recommend checking out the following resources:

* "Introduction to Model Theory" by Moses Schreiber: This textbook provides a comprehensive introduction to model theory, including an overview of rules of inference.
* "Logic for Mathematics Students" by Patrick Suppes: This textbook provides a clear and concise introduction to propositional and predicate logic, including rules of inference.
* Online resources such as Khan Academy's "Introduction to Logic" course and MIT OpenCourseWare's "Logic" course provide additional support and practice exercises.

**Summative assessment**

For the summative assessment, I will be evaluating students' ability to apply rules of inference in propositional and predicate logic. This will involve a written assignment where students will be presented with a series of logical arguments and asked to identify any fallacies or errors. Additionally, students will be required to provide step-by-step reasoning for their answers.

Grading criteria will include:

* Accuracy and completeness of argument
* Correct application of rules of inference
* Clarity and organization of writing

By the end of this lesson, students should have a solid understanding of rules of inference in propositional and predicate logic and be able to apply them to solve logical problems.

### Rules of inference with quantifiers Video• . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

The lecture discusses rules of inference with quantifiers, which are used to remove or reintroduce quantifiers within a statement. Universal instantiation removes the universal quantifier, while universal generalization introduces it. Existential instantiation removes the existential quantifier, while existential generalization introduces it. The universal modus ponens rule combines universal instantiation and modus ponens, while the universal modus tollens rule combines universal instantiation and modus tollens.

To formalize a statement using natural language, one must first determine the universe of discourse and variables, then reformulate the statement by making for all and there exists explicit, introduce variables and predicates, and finally, introduce quantifiers and logical operations. The statement "there exists a real number between any two, not equal real numbers" can be formalized as "for all real numbers x and y, there exists z where z is between x and y." The statement "every student has taken a course in machine learning" can be expressed as "for all x, M of x," while the statement "some student has taken a course in machine learning" can be expressed as "there exists x, M of x."

The lecture also covers De Morgan's laws for quantifiers and provides practice assignments to reinforce understanding. The rules of inference with quantifiers are essential for working with complex statements in predicate logic. The universal modus ponens and universal modus tollens rules are crucial for making logical deductions using quantifiers. By mastering these rules, one can express complex statements using quantifiers and make logical deductions with precision.

In addition to the lecture materials, there are practice assignments and a peer-graded assignment that cover predicate logic. The reading materials provide summaries of the topics covered in the lecture and offer additional practice questions.

### Topic 4 summary Reading• . Duration: 15 minutes 15 min

Here are the 15 sentences summarizing the text:

Predicate logic is a branch of logic that extends propositional logic by dealing with predicates and quantifiers. This allows for more expressive and detailed logical representations. The key elements of predicate logic include understanding propositional logic, recognizing the limitations of propositional logic, and learning about terms, predicates, quantifiers, and logical connectives.

Predicate logic enables the translation of natural language statements into formal expressions. It also involves interpreting complex formulas involving multiple quantifiers and predicates. Evaluating logical formulas is another crucial aspect of predicate logic, where truth values are determined based on a particular domain and interpretation.

Understanding logical equivalence, validity, satisfiability, and entailment in predicate logic is essential. Applying quantifiers correctly is critical, including the use of universal and existential quantifiers. Manipulating and transforming logical expressions involving quantifiers is also necessary.

Predicate logic includes techniques such as direct proof, proof by contradiction, and proof by contrapositive for constructing formal proofs. Critical analysis of arguments is also a key aspect, where validity and errors in reasoning are assessed. Improving overall logical thinking and problem-solving skills is the ultimate goal of studying predicate logic.

Regularly assessing understanding against learning outcomes is crucial as students progress through the course. Identifying areas for improvement allows for targeted action plans to be developed. Strategies for improving understanding include reviewing course materials, seeking additional resources, practicing problems, and scheduling additional study sessions.

The exercise aims to help students reflect on their learning journey, identify knowledge gaps, and develop an action plan to improve their understanding of predicate logic. The final assessment will evaluate the student's mastery of the subject matter.

### Introduction to Boolean algebra Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Boolean algebra is a new topic that will be introduced in this lecture. The history of Boolean algebra dates back to Aristotle's work on logic between 384 and 322 BC. George Boole published an investigation of the laws of thought in 1854, developing a system of logical algebra for mathematical expression of reasoning. Claude Shannon wrote a thesis in 1938, investigating Boolean algebra as a tool for analyzing relay switching circuits.

Today, Boolean algebra is the foundation of computer circuit analysis and design of transistors, which are the basic elements in building processors. A two-valued Boolean algebra system is used, where variables can only have values of zero or one. The operators "+" and "." are used instead of "and" and "or". The most well-known form of Boolean algebra is a two-valued system.

Boolean algebra is based on three fundamental operations: the logical product (AND), represented as x.y; the logical sum (OR), represented as x+y; and the logic complement (NOT), represented as x'. The truth tables for these operators are provided. When parentheses are not used, these operators have a specific order of precedence.

The two-valued Boolean algebra system can be used to describe and design digital circuits. It is also the basis for designing transistors in building processors. For example, an IoT system can be designed using a Boolean algebra equation, such as w = h and a, where w represents the spray in water, h represents high heat detected, and a represents the system being activated.

Overall, this lecture introduces Boolean algebra, its history, applications, and basic operations, providing a foundation for computer circuit analysis.

### Postulates of Boolean algebra Video• . Duration: 8 minutes 8 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving all key information, formulae, and technical details:

Boolean algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with logical operations. The six axioms of Boolean algebra, known as Huntington's postulates, are: closure, identity, commutativity, complements, distributivity, and uniqueness of complements. These axioms define the properties of Boolean operations such as AND (dot) and OR (plus). The Boolean operation satisfies the following laws: idempotent law (x + x = x and x.x = x), tautology (x + 1 is always true), contradiction (x * 0 is always false), involution (x complemented twice equals x), associative law (x + y + z = x + y + z), absorption law (x + xy = x and x.x + y = x), and uniqueness of complements. De Morgan's theorems state that the complement of a product is equal to the sum of the complements, and the complement of a sum is equal to the product of the complements. The principle of duality states that every theorem in Boolean algebra remains valid if we interchange all ANDs and ORs and interchange all zeros and ones. There are four ways to prove the equivalence of Boolean relations: perfect induction (showing identical truth tables), axiomatic proof (applying Huntington's postulates or other rules), duality principle, and contradiction. The absorption rule can be proved by writing a true table or using the rules earlier seen as x + xy = x and x.x + y = x. Boolean algebra has many applications in digital electronics and computer science, including circuit design and analysis. Understanding Boolean algebra is essential for designing and analyzing digital circuits, which are used in computers, communication systems, and other electronic devices.

### Boolean functions Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

A Boolean function defines a mapping from one or multiple Boolean input values to a Boolean output value. For n Boolean input values, there are 2^n possible combinations. A truth table can be used to represent a Boolean function, but it is not the only form of representation. The algebraic form of a Boolean function can be expressed in various ways, including the sum of products form and the product of sums form.

The sum of products form is more convenient for simplification purposes. To build a function in this form, focus on the values of the variable that make the output equal to 1, then express it as the sum of products of all the terms for which f equals 1. If an input equals 0, its complement is used.

The exclusive or function can be expressed as x or y = x'y + xy'. The implies function can be expressed as x → y = x' + y. Two useful Boolean functions are the exclusive or function and the implies function. These functions have specific truth tables that illustrate their behavior. 

The sum of products form is used in this lecture for building Boolean functions. It allows for easier simplification of complex expressions.

### Postulates of Boolean algebra Reading• . Duration: 15 minutes 15 min

Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Boolean algebra is a mathematical structure that captures the essentials of logic operations and set operations. The primary postulates of Boolean algebra are: closure with respect to binary operations, identity, complement, commutativity, associativity, distributivity, absorption, idempotent law, De Morgan's laws. These postulates provide a formal framework for manipulating and reasoning about logical expressions and digital circuits using addition (+) for OR and multiplication (⋅) for AND. The set S={0,1} is closed under the operations of addition and multiplication, meaning that for all a,b∈S, a+b∈S and a.b∈S. For all a∈S, we have a+0=a and a.1=a, which represent the identity element for OR and AND operations, respectively. Every element a∈S has a complement a’∈S such that a+a’=1 and a.a’=0, representing the complement operation. The commutative law states that a+b=b+a and a,b=b.a, indicating that the order of elements does not change the result. Associativity holds for all a,b,c∈S, meaning that (a+b)+c=a+(b+c) and (a.b).c=a.(b.c), showing that the order in which elements are combined does not affect the result. Distributivity states that a.(b+c)=a.b+a.c and a+(b+c)=(a+b)+c, demonstrating the relationship between addition and multiplication operations. The absorption law states that a+(a.b)=a and a.(a+b)b=a, showing that certain combinations can be simplified. De Morgan's laws state that (a+b)’=a’.b’ and (a.b)’=a’+b’, which provide a way to simplify complex logical expressions. These principles are foundational to computer science, digital logic design, and various fields involving binary decision processes. The postulates of Boolean algebra provide a mathematical structure for analyzing and designing digital circuits and computer algorithms. By understanding these fundamental concepts, one can better appreciate the power of Boolean algebra in solving problems related to logic and computation.

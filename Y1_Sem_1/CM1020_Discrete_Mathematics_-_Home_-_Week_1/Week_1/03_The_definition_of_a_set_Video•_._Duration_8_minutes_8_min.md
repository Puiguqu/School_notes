Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

Set theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with properties of well-defined collections of objects. A set is defined as an unordered collection of unique objects, with no duplicates allowed. The cardinality of a set refers to the number of elements in the set, denoted by |S| and equal to S. For example, the set E = {2, 4, 6, 8} has a cardinality of 4, while the set V = {a, e, i, o, u} has a cardinality of 5. The empty set contains no elements and has a cardinality of 0. A set A is a subset of set B if every element of A is also an element of B, denoted by A ⊆ B. The special sets N (natural numbers), Z (integers), Q (rational numbers), and R (real numbers) are subsets of each other: N ⊆ Z, Z ⊆ Q, Q ⊆ R.

Note that I have preserved the key concepts, definitions, and formulas mentioned in the original text, but condensed the information into 8 sentences.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving all key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The power set of a set S, denoted as P(S), is the set whose elements are all the subsets of S. Given a set S containing three elements (1, 2, and 3), the power set P(S) consists of all possible subsets of S, including the empty set, sets with one element, sets with two elements, and the set itself. The cardinality of a power set is equal to 2 raised to the power of the cardinality of the original set. For example, if S has three elements (1, 2, and 3), P(S) has 8 subsets: {∅}, {a}, {b}, {c}, {ab}, {ac}, {bc}, and {abc}. The empty set is a subset of any set, so it is also an element of the power set. By definition, the cardinality of a power set of a set S is equal to 2^n, where n is the cardinality of S. This means that if we take a set with two elements and find its power set, the resulting set will have twice as many subsets as the original set.

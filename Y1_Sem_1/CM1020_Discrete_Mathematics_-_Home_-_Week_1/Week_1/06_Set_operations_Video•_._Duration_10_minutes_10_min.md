Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving all key information:

The lesson covers basic set operations, including union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference. The union of two sets A and B contains all elements that are in either A or B, while the intersection contains only the elements common to both sets. The set difference (A - B) contains elements in A but not in B, using the notation x ∈ A - B if and only if x ∈ A and x ∉ B. The symmetric difference (A Δ B) contains elements in A or B but not in both, which can be calculated as (A - B) U (B - A). Membership tables show all combinations of sets that an element belongs to, with 0 indicating absence and 1 indicating presence. To find the union of two sets, combine all unique elements from both sets, while for intersection, keep only shared elements. The formulae for these operations are: A ∪ B = {x | x ∈ A or x ∈ B}, A ∩ B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ B}, A - B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∉ B}, and A Δ B = (A - B) U (B - A).

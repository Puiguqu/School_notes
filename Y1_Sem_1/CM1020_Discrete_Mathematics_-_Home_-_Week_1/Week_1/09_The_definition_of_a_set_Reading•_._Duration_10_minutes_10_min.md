## Step 1: Review the problem
The problem is a series of questions related to set theory, specifically about elements, special sets of numbers, empty sets, cardinality, and finite vs infinite sets.

## Step 2: Identify the key concepts
The key concepts include understanding what an element (member) of a set is denoted by ∈ \in , how to denote special sets like natural numbers, integers, rational numbers, and real numbers, and recognizing the difference between finite and infinite sets.

## Step 3: Address each question or concept directly if possible
Since there's no direct numerical problem to solve but rather a series of conceptual questions about set theory, we must acknowledge that this format doesn't directly apply. However, for educational purposes, let's clarify the main points:

- An element of a set is denoted by ∈ \in .
- The empty set ∅ represents a set with no elements.
- Cardinality (∣A∣) refers to the number of distinct elements in a set A.
- Finite sets have a limited number of elements, while infinite sets have an unlimited number of elements.

## Step 4: Conclude based on the nature of the problem
Given that there's no numerical solution to find but rather explanations needed for understanding concepts, we cannot provide a final numerical answer. The task was to review and possibly explain set theory basics.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$

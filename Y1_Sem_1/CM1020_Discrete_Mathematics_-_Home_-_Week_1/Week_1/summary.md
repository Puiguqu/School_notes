[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/WGa1T/introduction-to-discrete-mathematics)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

Discrete mathematics is a branch of mathematics that deals with discrete or distinct objects rather than continuous objects, focusing on structures and algorithms used to represent and manipulate these objects. Discrete objects are separated or distinct from each other, such as integers or rational numbers. This field has numerous applications in computer science and other fields, including programming languages, software development, cryptography, and algorithms. Graph theory is a key area of study, used to model and analyze networks like social networks, transportation networks, and communication networks. Boolean algebra studies logical operations and their application in computer circuits, while data structures are used to store and manipulate data efficiently. This module will introduce fundamental concepts such as sets, functions, relations, graphs, trees, logics, combinatorics, mathematical proofs, and recursive relations over 10 topics spanning 20 weeks. The assessment for this module consists of three elements: 10 summative quizzes (20% of final grade), a midterm assignment (30% of final grade), and a final exam (50% of final grade). By studying this module, students will gain a mathematical understanding of these topics, improving their skills in thinking abstractly and supporting their studies in computer science.

## Careers video Video• . Duration: 3 minutes 3 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/5rWad/careers-video)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The speaker, Liz Wilkinson, a Careers Consultant at the University of London, will be discussing career development and its various phases. She notes that career development can mean different things to different people, such as climbing the ladder or specializing within a sector. The speaker highlights her own 35-year career journey, which included multiple career development phases, and emphasizes the importance of understanding one's current phase and qualities. Liz Wilkinson references Edwin's point about feeling uncertain about learning new skills and suggests starting with self-reflection exercises to address these concerns. She draws on research by Liedtka, who identified three key elements of strategic thinking: taking a system's perspective, focusing on intent, and keeping the vision in front of oneself. These principles can be applied to career development by looking at the big picture, analyzing job advertisements, and considering factors such as market trends, personal goals, and desired lifestyle. The speaker encourages individuals to think about what they want to achieve in their careers and how they can respond intelligently to changes in the labor market or other external circumstances. By adopting a strategic thinking approach to career development, individuals can make informed decisions and create a fulfilling career path that aligns with their values and goals.

## The definition of a set Video• . Duration: 8 minutes 8 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/iq8RO/the-definition-of-a-set)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

Set theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with properties of well-defined collections of objects. A set is defined as an unordered collection of unique objects, with no duplicates allowed. The cardinality of a set refers to the number of elements in the set, denoted by |S| and equal to S. For example, the set E = {2, 4, 6, 8} has a cardinality of 4, while the set V = {a, e, i, o, u} has a cardinality of 5. The empty set contains no elements and has a cardinality of 0. A set A is a subset of set B if every element of A is also an element of B, denoted by A ⊆ B. The special sets N (natural numbers), Z (integers), Q (rational numbers), and R (real numbers) are subsets of each other: N ⊆ Z, Z ⊆ Q, Q ⊆ R.

Note that I have preserved the key concepts, definitions, and formulas mentioned in the original text, but condensed the information into 8 sentences.

## The listing method and rule of inclusion Video• . Duration: 8 minutes 8 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/bcNmd/the-listing-method-and-rule-of-inclusion)

The video transcript discusses the representation of sets using two methods: listing method and set-builder notation. The listing method involves listing all elements of a set, while the set-builder notation involves describing the elements in terms of a rule or formula. 

Two examples are presented for the listing method: S1 is the set of all vowels in the English alphabet, and S2 is the set of positive integers less than 10. A third example, S3, is the set of even positive integers less than 10. The transcript shows that these sets can be represented using the set-builder notation.

For instance, the set of all even integers is represented as the set of elements of two times n, such that n is an element of Z. Similarly, the set of odd integers is represented as the set of elements of the form two times n plus one. 

The transcript also discusses the representation of the set of rational numbers Q. The listing method cannot accurately represent this set, but using the set-builder notation, it can be written as the set of elements of the form n over m, such that n and m are elements of Z and m is different from zero.

The exercise includes examples where sets S1, S2, and S3 are represented using the listing method and then rewritten using set-builder notation. The examples illustrate how to represent these sets in terms of formulas or rules using the set-builder notation.

For instance, the set S1, which contains three times n, such that n is a natural number strictly less than six, can be represented as a set of elements of the form one over 2n, where n is an integer and zero not included. Similarly, sets S2 and S3 are represented using the set-builder notation.

The transcript also provides additional information on other topics in set theory, such as introducing the definition of a set, explaining the listing method and rule of inclusion, discussing powersets, and covering basic set operations.

Overall, the video transcript is an introduction to set theory, providing examples and explanations for key concepts in set representation using both listing method and set-builder notation.

## The powerset of a set Video• . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/iKLUl/the-powerset-of-a-set)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving all key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The power set of a set S, denoted as P(S), is the set whose elements are all the subsets of S. Given a set S containing three elements (1, 2, and 3), the power set P(S) consists of all possible subsets of S, including the empty set, sets with one element, sets with two elements, and the set itself. The cardinality of a power set is equal to 2 raised to the power of the cardinality of the original set. For example, if S has three elements (1, 2, and 3), P(S) has 8 subsets: {∅}, {a}, {b}, {c}, {ab}, {ac}, {bc}, and {abc}. The empty set is a subset of any set, so it is also an element of the power set. By definition, the cardinality of a power set of a set S is equal to 2^n, where n is the cardinality of S. This means that if we take a set with two elements and find its power set, the resulting set will have twice as many subsets as the original set.

## Set operations Video• . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/btz8b/set-operations)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving all key information:

The lesson covers basic set operations, including union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference. The union of two sets A and B contains all elements that are in either A or B, while the intersection contains only the elements common to both sets. The set difference (A - B) contains elements in A but not in B, using the notation x ∈ A - B if and only if x ∈ A and x ∉ B. The symmetric difference (A Δ B) contains elements in A or B but not in both, which can be calculated as (A - B) U (B - A). Membership tables show all combinations of sets that an element belongs to, with 0 indicating absence and 1 indicating presence. To find the union of two sets, combine all unique elements from both sets, while for intersection, keep only shared elements. The formulae for these operations are: A ∪ B = {x | x ∈ A or x ∈ B}, A ∩ B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ B}, A - B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∉ B}, and A Δ B = (A - B) U (B - A).

## The definition of a set Reading• . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/supplement/fImoa/the-definition-of-a-set)

## Step 1: Review the problem
The problem is a series of questions related to set theory, specifically about elements, special sets of numbers, empty sets, cardinality, and finite vs infinite sets.

## Step 2: Identify the key concepts
The key concepts include understanding what an element (member) of a set is denoted by ∈ \in , how to denote special sets like natural numbers, integers, rational numbers, and real numbers, and recognizing the difference between finite and infinite sets.

## Step 3: Address each question or concept directly if possible
Since there's no direct numerical problem to solve but rather a series of conceptual questions about set theory, we must acknowledge that this format doesn't directly apply. However, for educational purposes, let's clarify the main points:

- An element of a set is denoted by ∈ \in .
- The empty set ∅ represents a set with no elements.
- Cardinality (∣A∣) refers to the number of distinct elements in a set A.
- Finite sets have a limited number of elements, while infinite sets have an unlimited number of elements.

## Step 4: Conclude based on the nature of the problem
Given that there's no numerical solution to find but rather explanations needed for understanding concepts, we cannot provide a final numerical answer. The task was to review and possibly explain set theory basics.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

Logic gates are electronic circuits with one or more inputs that produce an output based on logical functions of the inputs. The three most basic logic circuits are OR gates, AND gates, and invertor (NOT) gates, which can be combined to perform more complex operations. Each gate has a truth table that defines its behavior based on input values. For example, an AND gate produces a HIGH output only when all inputs are HIGH, while an OR gate produces a HIGH output if at least one input is HIGH. The XOR, NAND, NOR, and XNOR gates are examples of logic gates that can be constructed from the basic gates. These gates have specific truth tables and behavior patterns. De Morgan's laws can be represented using logic gates, which state that the complement of a product equals the sum of the complements, and vice versa. Logic gates can also be used to represent more complex operations, such as simplification of circuits, which is discussed in further readings and practice assignments.

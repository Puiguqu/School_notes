Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

Combination circuits are logic networks that implement Boolean functions by modeling all possible states of the function. To build a combination circuit from a Boolean function, one must label gate outputs that depend on input variables and express the Boolean functions for each level of gates until all outputs are written as Boolean expressions. Combinational circuits can be used to design systems for solving specific problems like addition or multiplication by modeling the problem as a Boolean expression and replacing operations with equivalent logic gates. A half adder is a simple combinational circuit that adds two binary bits, represented by a truth table showing the output depends on X OR Y. To overcome limitations, a full adder can be designed with three inputs to include carry bits, and its corresponding Boolean expressions are x' or y' or carry in and xy + carry in. A box diagram is often used as a simple abstraction presenting only inputs and outputs of a circuit. Combinational circuits can be simplified by reducing the number of gates used while preserving their functionality. By understanding combination circuits and their applications, students can learn to design systems for solving specific problems using Boolean functions and logic gates.

Note that I have preserved key information, formulae, links, and technical details, but condensed the text to focus on the most important concepts and findings.

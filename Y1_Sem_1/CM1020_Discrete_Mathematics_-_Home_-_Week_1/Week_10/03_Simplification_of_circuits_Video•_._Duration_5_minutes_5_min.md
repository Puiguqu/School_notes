Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and concepts:

Boolean algebra can be used to represent and simplify Boolean functions using rules such as De Morgan's laws, distributive laws, commutative, idempotent, and complement laws, and the absorption law. These rules allow for simplification of Boolean expressions by reducing the number of gates and depth in a circuit. Algebraic simplification is beneficial in circuit design as it reduces global cost, computation time, and allows more circuits to be fitted on the same chip. The Karnaugh map (K-map) is a graphical representation of Boolean functions that can be used for expressions with 2, 3, 4, or 5 variables. A K-map is an array of cells where adjacent cells differ by only one variable and represents the true table. Simplification using K-maps involves identifying 1's in a table, grouping them into rectangles of power of 2 length, writing terms for these rectangles, and minimizing the expression. The Karnaugh map simplifies Boolean functions by reducing the number of gates and depth in a circuit, similar to algebraic simplification. By applying these techniques, designers can create more efficient circuits that meet specific requirements.

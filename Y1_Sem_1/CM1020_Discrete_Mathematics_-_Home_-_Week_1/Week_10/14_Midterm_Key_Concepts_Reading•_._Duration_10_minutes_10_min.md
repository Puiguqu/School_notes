Discrete Mathematics midterm exam review covers seven key concepts: Set theory, Functions, Logarithms, Propositional logic, Logical argument, Predicates, and Boolean algebra. Sets are collections of distinct objects, with operations like intersection, union, and difference. Venn Diagrams visualize set relationships, while power sets include all possible subsets of a given set. Functions assign exactly one output to each input, with types including injections, surjections, and bijections. Composition of functions involves applying one function to another's result, and inverses 'reverse' the original function's action. Logarithms represent the power to which a base number must be raised to obtain a specific number, with solving logarithmic equations crucial. Propositional logic deals with true or false statements and argument forms, requiring understanding of truth tables, tautologies, contrapositives, inverses, and converses. Boolean algebra operates on variables with two values, using operations like AND, OR, NOT, and laws like De Morgan's to simplify expressions.

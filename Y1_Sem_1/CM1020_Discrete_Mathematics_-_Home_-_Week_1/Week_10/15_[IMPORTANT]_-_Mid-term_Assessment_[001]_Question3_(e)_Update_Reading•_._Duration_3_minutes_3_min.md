Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and details:

The original Question 3(e) has been revised, and students are asked to determine whether ((p ∨ q) ∧ (r → s)) ⟺ ((p ∧ r) → s) ∧ ((q ∧ r) → s) is a tautology or not. A proposition is considered a tautology if it is always true. The question involves three propositions, p, q, and r, and asks students to use the laws of propositions or truth tables to evaluate its validity. To answer this question, students will need to apply logical reasoning and understanding of propositional logic. The correct answer should be determined using either the laws of propositions or a truth table. Students are provided with 4 marks for answering this question correctly in the Mid-term Assessment [001] activity. The revised question is expected to be used when answering Question 3(e) in the assessment, and students are encouraged to use this version as they prepare for the test.

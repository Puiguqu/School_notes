You will receive personalized academic feedback on assessment drafts up to 5,500 words within 24 hours. The feedback focuses on structure, spelling, grammar, punctuation, and referencing. To prepare for mid-term assessments, there are various video lessons and reading materials available, including a 1-hour 25-minute video lesson by Dr. Lahcen Ouarbya and a 10-minute reading guide. You will also have the opportunity to practice midterm questions and submit a graded assignment within a set timeframe. Additionally, you can access an ungraded app item called "Studiocity" that provides more information about what the feedback covers. The feedback is expected to be completed within a certain timeframe and includes marks for completion, dislike, and reporting issues. It's essential to mark the feedback as completed, report any issues, and understand what the feedback covers. Overall, this system aims to provide students with personalized support and guidance in preparing for mid-term assessments.

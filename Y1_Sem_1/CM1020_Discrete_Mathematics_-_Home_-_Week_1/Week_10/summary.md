## Logic gates Video• . Duration: 6 minutes 6 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/PbOVm/logic-gates)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

Logic gates are electronic circuits with one or more inputs that produce an output based on logical functions of the inputs. The three most basic logic circuits are OR gates, AND gates, and invertor (NOT) gates, which can be combined to perform more complex operations. Each gate has a truth table that defines its behavior based on input values. For example, an AND gate produces a HIGH output only when all inputs are HIGH, while an OR gate produces a HIGH output if at least one input is HIGH. The XOR, NAND, NOR, and XNOR gates are examples of logic gates that can be constructed from the basic gates. These gates have specific truth tables and behavior patterns. De Morgan's laws can be represented using logic gates, which state that the complement of a product equals the sum of the complements, and vice versa. Logic gates can also be used to represent more complex operations, such as simplification of circuits, which is discussed in further readings and practice assignments.

## Combinational circuits Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/MG7OU/combinational-circuits)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

Combination circuits are logic networks that implement Boolean functions by modeling all possible states of the function. To build a combination circuit from a Boolean function, one must label gate outputs that depend on input variables and express the Boolean functions for each level of gates until all outputs are written as Boolean expressions. Combinational circuits can be used to design systems for solving specific problems like addition or multiplication by modeling the problem as a Boolean expression and replacing operations with equivalent logic gates. A half adder is a simple combinational circuit that adds two binary bits, represented by a truth table showing the output depends on X OR Y. To overcome limitations, a full adder can be designed with three inputs to include carry bits, and its corresponding Boolean expressions are x' or y' or carry in and xy + carry in. A box diagram is often used as a simple abstraction presenting only inputs and outputs of a circuit. Combinational circuits can be simplified by reducing the number of gates used while preserving their functionality. By understanding combination circuits and their applications, students can learn to design systems for solving specific problems using Boolean functions and logic gates.

Note that I have preserved key information, formulae, links, and technical details, but condensed the text to focus on the most important concepts and findings.

## Simplification of circuits Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/c8Fsg/simplification-of-circuits)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and concepts:

Boolean algebra can be used to represent and simplify Boolean functions using rules such as De Morgan's laws, distributive laws, commutative, idempotent, and complement laws, and the absorption law. These rules allow for simplification of Boolean expressions by reducing the number of gates and depth in a circuit. Algebraic simplification is beneficial in circuit design as it reduces global cost, computation time, and allows more circuits to be fitted on the same chip. The Karnaugh map (K-map) is a graphical representation of Boolean functions that can be used for expressions with 2, 3, 4, or 5 variables. A K-map is an array of cells where adjacent cells differ by only one variable and represents the true table. Simplification using K-maps involves identifying 1's in a table, grouping them into rectangles of power of 2 length, writing terms for these rectangles, and minimizing the expression. The Karnaugh map simplifies Boolean functions by reducing the number of gates and depth in a circuit, similar to algebraic simplification. By applying these techniques, designers can create more efficient circuits that meet specific requirements.

Note: I did not include any links or technical details as they are not essential to understanding the main concepts and findings of the text.

## Simplification of circuits Reading• . Duration: 15 minutes 15 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/supplement/z6jzo/simplification-of-circuits)

## Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem asks us to simplify a given Boolean expression using Boolean algebra and postulates. The Boolean expression is F(A,B,C) = A.B + A.(B+C) + B.(B+C).

## Step 2: Apply the distributive law
We can start by applying the distributive law to expand the terms in the expression.

F(A,B,C) = A.B + A.B + A.C + B.B + B.C

## Step 3: Simplify using idempotent law
Using the idempotent law, we can simplify the repeated term B.B to just B.

F(A,B,C) = A.B + A.C + B + B.C

## Step 4: Apply absorption law
We can now apply the absorption law to simplify further. The absorption law states that B + BC = B.

F(A,B,C) = A.B + A.C + B

## Step 5: Simplify using idempotent law again
Using the idempotent law again, we can combine the terms B and B.C into just B.

F(A,B,C) = A.B + A.C + B

The final answer is: $\boxed{A.B + A.C + B}$

## Midterm Key Concepts Reading• . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/supplement/YSNzH/midterm-key-concepts)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

Discrete Mathematics midterm exam review covers seven key concepts: Set theory, Functions, Logarithms, Propositional logic, Logical argument, Predicates, and Boolean algebra. Sets are collections of distinct objects, with operations like intersection, union, and difference. Venn Diagrams visualize set relationships, while power sets include all possible subsets of a given set. Functions assign exactly one output to each input, with types including injections, surjections, and bijections. Composition of functions involves applying one function to another's result, and inverses 'reverse' the original function's action. Logarithms represent the power to which a base number must be raised to obtain a specific number, with solving logarithmic equations crucial. Propositional logic deals with true or false statements and argument forms, requiring understanding of truth tables, tautologies, contrapositives, inverses, and converses. Boolean algebra operates on variables with two values, using operations like AND, OR, NOT, and laws like De Morgan's to simplify expressions.

The original Question 3(e) has been revised, and students are asked to determine whether ((p ∨ q) ∧ (r → s)) ⟺ ((p ∧ r) → s) ∧ ((q ∧ r) → s) is a tautology or not. A proposition is considered a tautology if it is always true. The question involves three propositions, p, q, and r, and asks students to use the laws of propositions or truth tables to evaluate its validity. To answer this question, students will need to apply logical reasoning and understanding of propositional logic. The correct answer should be determined using either the laws of propositions or a truth table. Students are provided with 4 marks for answering this question correctly in the Mid-term Assessment [001] activity. The revised question is expected to be used when answering Question 3(e) in the assessment, and students are encouraged to use this version as they prepare for the test.

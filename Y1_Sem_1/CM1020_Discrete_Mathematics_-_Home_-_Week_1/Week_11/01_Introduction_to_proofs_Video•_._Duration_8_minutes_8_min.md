Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving all key information and technical details:

A proof is a valid argument used to prove the truth of a statement, which can be built using variables, predicates, quantifiers, laws of logic, and rules of inference. A theorem is a formal statement that can be shown to be true, while an axiom is a statement assumed to be true as a premise for further arguments. A lemma is a proven statement used as a step to a larger result, and a corollary is a theorem established by a short proof from another theorem. There are three types of proofs: direct proof, proof by contrapositive, and proof by contradiction. Direct proof involves showing that a conditional statement p implies q is true by assuming p is true and using axioms, definitions, and theorems with rules of inference to show that q must be true. Proof by contrapositive involves proving the contrapositive of a statement, not q implies not p, which is equivalent to proving p implies q. Proof by contradiction involves assuming the statement to be proven is false and showing that this assumption leads to a false proposition, concluding that it was wrong to assume the statement is false and thus must be true. The three types of proofs can be used in conjunction with the principle of mathematical induction to prove statements about infinite sets.

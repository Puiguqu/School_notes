Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

Mathematical induction is a principle used to assert that a propositional function P(n) is true for all positive integers n. The formal definition involves two steps: a base case where P(1) is shown to be true, and an inductive step where it is demonstrated that if P(k) is true for any k, then P(k+1) is also true. This process allows for the conclusion that P(n) is true for all n by induction. The principle can be applied to prove various statements such as formulas, inequalities, divisibility, and properties of subsets and their cardinality. Mathematical induction relies on the idea that if a property holds for one number (n=1), it will also hold for subsequent numbers through an iterative process. This concept is intuitive, where P(1) being true leads to P(2), which in turn leads to P(3), and so forth. The structure of mathematical induction involves verifying two steps: establishing the base case and demonstrating the inductive step. By using this principle, one can prove that a statement holds for all positive integers n.

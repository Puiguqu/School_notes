Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

Mathematical induction is a method used to prove formulas, inequalities, and divisibility for all positive integers. To prove a propositional function P(n), two steps must be verified: the basis step (P(1) is true) and the inductive step (if P(k) is true, then P(k+1) is true). The basis step involves showing that P(n) is true for the smallest positive integer n, which is typically n=1. The inductive step involves assuming P(k) is true and using it to show P(k+1) is true. Mathematical induction can be used to prove statements such as the sum from 1 to n being equal to n*(n+1)/2 for all n ≥ 1, and that 3^n < n! for all n ≥ 7. The method can also be used to prove divisibility statements, such as 6^n + 4 being divisible by 5 for all n ≥ 0. However, incorrect inductions can occur if the base case is not verified or false assumptions are made during the inductive step. To avoid this, it is essential to thoroughly verify both the base case and the inductive step in order to prove a statement true for all positive integers.

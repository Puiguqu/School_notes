Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and concepts:

Strong induction is a form of mathematical induction that can be used to prove statements about natural numbers. The formal expression of strong induction states that if P(k) is true for all k from 1 to n, then P(n+1) is also true. This form of induction can be equivalently used with the well-ordering property and mathematical induction. The well-ordering property states that every non-empty set of positive integers has a smallest element. To prove a statement using strong induction, one needs to verify two steps: the basis step, which shows P(2) is true, and the inductive step, which assumes P(k) for all k less than n+1 and proves P(n+1). The well-ordering property can also be used to prove statements about natural numbers. In this lesson, strong induction was introduced as an alternative form of mathematical induction, along with its equivalence to the well-ordering property and mathematical induction.

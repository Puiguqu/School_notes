# Induction Readingâ€¢ . Duration: 2 hours 2h

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/supplement/p92LX/induction)

There is no text provided for me to summarize. The text appears to be a list of links and instructions related to reading a textbook and completing exercises on mathematical induction, but it does not contain any actual content or information that I can summarize. If you could provide the relevant text, I would be happy to assist you in summarizing it in 8 sentences while preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving all key information and technical details:

A proof is a valid argument used to prove the truth of a statement, which can be built using variables, predicates, quantifiers, laws of logic, and rules of inference. A theorem is a formal statement that can be shown to be true, while an axiom is a statement assumed to be true as a premise for further arguments. A lemma is a proven statement used as a step to a larger result, and a corollary is a theorem established by a short proof from another theorem. There are three types of proofs: direct proof, proof by contrapositive, and proof by contradiction. Direct proof involves showing that a conditional statement p implies q is true by assuming p is true and using axioms, definitions, and theorems with rules of inference to show that q must be true. Proof by contrapositive involves proving the contrapositive of a statement, not q implies not p, which is equivalent to proving p implies q. Proof by contradiction involves assuming the statement to be proven is false and showing that this assumption leads to a false proposition, concluding that it was wrong to assume the statement is false and thus must be true. The three types of proofs can be used in conjunction with the principle of mathematical induction to prove statements about infinite sets.

## The principle of mathematical induction Video• . Duration: 3 minutes 3 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/kJ0Xr/the-principle-of-mathematical-induction)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

Mathematical induction is a principle used to assert that a propositional function P(n) is true for all positive integers n. The formal definition involves two steps: a base case where P(1) is shown to be true, and an inductive step where it is demonstrated that if P(k) is true for any k, then P(k+1) is also true. This process allows for the conclusion that P(n) is true for all n by induction. The principle can be applied to prove various statements such as formulas, inequalities, divisibility, and properties of subsets and their cardinality. Mathematical induction relies on the idea that if a property holds for one number (n=1), it will also hold for subsequent numbers through an iterative process. This concept is intuitive, where P(1) being true leads to P(2), which in turn leads to P(3), and so forth. The structure of mathematical induction involves verifying two steps: establishing the base case and demonstrating the inductive step. By using this principle, one can prove that a statement holds for all positive integers n.

## Proof by induction Video• . Duration: 7 minutes 7 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/uZ1u0/proof-by-induction)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

Mathematical induction is a method used to prove formulas, inequalities, and divisibility for all positive integers. To prove a propositional function P(n), two steps must be verified: the basis step (P(1) is true) and the inductive step (if P(k) is true, then P(k+1) is true). The basis step involves showing that P(n) is true for the smallest positive integer n, which is typically n=1. The inductive step involves assuming P(k) is true and using it to show P(k+1) is true. Mathematical induction can be used to prove statements such as the sum from 1 to n being equal to n*(n+1)/2 for all n ≥ 1, and that 3^n < n! for all n ≥ 7. The method can also be used to prove divisibility statements, such as 6^n + 4 being divisible by 5 for all n ≥ 0. However, incorrect inductions can occur if the base case is not verified or false assumptions are made during the inductive step. To avoid this, it is essential to thoroughly verify both the base case and the inductive step in order to prove a statement true for all positive integers.

## Strong induction Video• . Duration: 7 minutes 7 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/R07UA/strong-induction)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and concepts:

Strong induction is a form of mathematical induction that can be used to prove statements about natural numbers. The formal expression of strong induction states that if P(k) is true for all k from 1 to n, then P(n+1) is also true. This form of induction can be equivalently used with the well-ordering property and mathematical induction. The well-ordering property states that every non-empty set of positive integers has a smallest element. To prove a statement using strong induction, one needs to verify two steps: the basis step, which shows P(2) is true, and the inductive step, which assumes P(k) for all k less than n+1 and proves P(n+1). The well-ordering property can also be used to prove statements about natural numbers. In this lesson, strong induction was introduced as an alternative form of mathematical induction, along with its equivalence to the well-ordering property and mathematical induction.

There is no text provided for me to summarize. The text appears to be a list of links and instructions related to reading a textbook and completing exercises on mathematical induction, but it does not contain any actual content or information that I can summarize. If you could provide the relevant text, I would be happy to assist you in summarizing it in 8 sentences while preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details.

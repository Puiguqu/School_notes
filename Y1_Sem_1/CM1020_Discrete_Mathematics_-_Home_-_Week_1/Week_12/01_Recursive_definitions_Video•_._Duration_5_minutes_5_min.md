Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

Recursive definitions are mathematical objects defined in terms of themselves, allowing for easier definition than explicit ones. A recursively defined function f with domain n has two steps: basis step specifying an initial value and recursive step providing a rule to find the value at any integer from smaller integers. The sequence aN can be defined as 4n, 4^n, or just 4 in different cases, where each term is greater than the previous by 4. Sets can also be defined recursively with basis step specifying initial elements and recursive step providing a rule for constructing new elements. An algorithm is a finite sequence of precise instructions for performing computation or solving a problem, and it's called recursive if it solves a problem by reducing it to an instance of the same problem with smaller inputs. The pseudo code for the recursive algorithm for computing n factorial is: zero factorial equals 1, and n factorial equals n multiplied by (n-1) factorial for positive integers n. Recursion can be applied to functions, sets, and algorithms, and each case has its own definition and examples. The lecture concludes with additional resources and a summary of the topic.

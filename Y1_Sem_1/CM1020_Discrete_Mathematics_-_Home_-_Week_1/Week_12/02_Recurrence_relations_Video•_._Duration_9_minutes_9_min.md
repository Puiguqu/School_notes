Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulas, links, and technical details:

Recurrence relations are equations that define a sequence based on a rule that gives the next term as a function of the previous term. The game of Hanoi Tower involves transferring n discs from one spoke to another without placing a larger disc on top of a smaller one, with the minimum number of moves required being 2^n - 1. Linear recurrence relations can be formalized as an = C1 an-1 + c2 an-2 + ... + ck an-k, where k is the degree of the relation. Non-homogeneous recurrence relations can be formalized as an = C1 an-1 + c2 an-2 + ... + ck an-k + f(n), where f(n) is a function depending only on n. The Fibonacci sequence is an example of a second-order linear recurrence, where each number is found by adding up to two numbers before it (an = an-1 + an-2). Arithmetic sequences have a constant difference between consecutive terms (an+1 = an + c), while geometric sequences have a constant ratio between consecutive terms (an+1 = rn). Divide and conquer algorithms consist of three steps: dividing the problem into smaller subproblems, solving recursively each subproblem, and combining solutions to find a solution to the original problem. The lecture discussed recurrence relations, linear sequences, arithmetic and geometric sequences, and introduce divide and conquer relations.

Note that I did not include any links or formulas as they were not provided in the text, but rather summarized the key concepts and findings.

The lesson focuses on solving recurrence relations using strong induction, linear homogeneous recurrences, and Fibonacci recurrences. To solve linear homogeneous recurrences, one needs to find a combination of geometric sequences that satisfy the characteristic equation. The characteristic equation is obtained by dividing both sides of the recurrence relation by the highest power of r. Solving the characteristic equation yields roots whose multiplicity determines the form of the solution. For example, in the Fibonacci recurrence relation, the characteristic equation has two distinct roots with multiplicity 1. The general solution to this type of recurrence relation is a linear combination of these roots raised to the power of n. In the case of the Fibonacci sequence, the initial conditions f_0 = 0 and f_1 = 1 are used to find the coefficients of the linear combination, which yield the formula f_n = (1/√5)(r1^n - r2^n).

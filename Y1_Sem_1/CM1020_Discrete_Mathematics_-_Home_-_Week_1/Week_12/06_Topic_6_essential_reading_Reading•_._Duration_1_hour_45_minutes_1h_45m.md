Unfortunately, there is no text to summarize in this case. The provided text appears to be a list of exercises and activities related to recursion from a textbook, but it does not contain any substantive content or information that needs to be summarized.

However, I can provide some general information about recursion:

Recursion is a fundamental concept in mathematics and computer science, where a function or algorithm calls itself repeatedly until a base case is reached. Recursively defined functions, sets, and algorithms are used to solve problems that have a recursive structure.

The textbook by Koshy covers these topics, including definitions, examples, exercises, and solutions. Students can access additional resources and practice assignments through video lectures, readings, and peer-grading activities.

If you'd like to provide the actual text from the Koshy textbook or another relevant source, I'll be happy to assist you in summarizing it.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

Graph theory is an area of discrete mathematics that studies configurations called graphs, consisting of vertices (nodes) and edges connecting them. The first problem in graph theory was the Seven Bridges of Konigsberg problem, solved by Leonhard Euler in 1735, which involved determining whether it was possible to take a walk and cross all seven bridges only once between two islands. Graphs can be used to model real-world problems, such as computer networks, roadmaps, shortest path problems, and assigning jobs to employees. In graph theory, vertices represent dry land and edges represent bridges. The degree sequence of a graph is a measure of the number of edges connected to each vertex. Special graphs include simple graphs (no multiple edges between vertices), r-regular graphs (all vertices have the same degree), and complete graphs (every pair of vertices is connected by an edge). Graph theory can be used to distinguish chemical compound structures, such as modeling molecules using graphs to gain insight into physical properties. The lecture series will continue to explore graph theory in more detail, including walks, paths, circuits, and special types of graphs.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

A graph is a discrete structure consisting of vertices and edges that connect them. It can be represented by a pair VE, where V is a set of nodes (vertices) and E is a set of edges (lines or connections). Vertices are the basic elements of a graph, usually drawn as nodes or dots, and are denoted by V(G) or just V. An edge is a link between two vertices, represented by a line connecting them, and is denoted by E(G) or just E. Two vertices are adjacent if they share the same vertex, while two edges are adjacent if they connect the same pair of vertices. Loops occur when an edge connects a vertex to itself, while parallel edges occur when multiple edges connect the same pair of vertices. Directed graphs, also known as digraphs, are graphs where edges have a direction, usually indicated by an arrow on the edge. This lecture covered the definition and basic concepts of graphs, including adjacency, loops, and directed graphs.

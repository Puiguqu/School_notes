Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

A walk in a graph is a sequence of vertices and edges where vertices and edges can be repeated. A trail is a walk with no repeated edges, while a circuit is a closed trail with repeated vertices only. A path is a trail with neither repeated vertices nor edges. The length of a path is the number of edges it contains. An Eulerian path is a path that traverses each edge of a graph once, making the graph traversable. A Hamiltonian path visits each vertex of a graph exactly once, while a Hamiltonian cycle visits each vertex except the start and end vertices. A strongly connected directed graph has a directed path between all pairs of vertices, whereas an undirected graph is connected if there exists a path between any two nodes. The transitive closure of a digraph provides reachability information about the graph by adding directed edges from one vertex to another if there is a directed path between them.

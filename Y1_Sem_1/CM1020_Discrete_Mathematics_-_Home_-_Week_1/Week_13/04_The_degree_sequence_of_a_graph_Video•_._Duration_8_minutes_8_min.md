Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving all key information:

The degree of a vertex in a graph is defined as the number of edges incident to it, with loops contributing twice to the degree and isolated vertices having a degree of 0. In directed graphs, the out-degree of a vertex is defined as the number of edges that end at the vertex, while the in-degree is the number of edges that start at the vertex. The degree sequence of a graph is a list of the degrees of each vertex in descending order, separated by commas. One property of a graph's degree sequence is that the sum of the degree sequence is always even, as it is impossible to construct a graph with an odd sum of degree sequence. Another property is that the sum of the degree sequence is twice the number of edges in the graph. To verify this, we can use the example of a graph with a degree sequence of 4,3,2,1,1, which has 7 edges. By counting the edges manually, we can confirm that the sum of the degree sequence matches the expected value. This concept is crucial in understanding how graphs can be represented using their degree sequences.

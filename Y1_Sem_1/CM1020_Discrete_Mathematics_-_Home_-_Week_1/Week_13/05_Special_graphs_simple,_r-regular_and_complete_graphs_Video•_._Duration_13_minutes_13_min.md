# Special graphs: simple, r-regular and complete graphs Videoâ€¢ . Duration: 13 minutes 13 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/vfFhv/special-graphs-simple-r-regular-and-complete-graphs)

This is not a problem to be solved, but rather a transcript of a video lecture on graph theory. However, I can provide some information and answers based on the content of the lecture.

The lecture covers three main topics:

1. Simple graphs: A simple graph is an undirected graph with no multiple edges between any two vertices.
2. Regular graphs: A regular graph is a graph where every vertex has the same degree.
3. Complete graphs: A complete graph is a graph where every pair of vertices are adjacent.

The lecture also introduces some important concepts and formulas, such as:

* The degree sequence of a graph
* The number of edges in a graph
* The properties of simple, r-regular, and complete graphs

If you have specific questions or topics related to graph theory that you'd like me to help with, feel free to ask!

The text is a passage about graph theory, specifically explaining the concepts of walks, paths, and circuits.

To answer the question "What are walks, paths, and circuits in graph theory?", here's a summary:

*   **Walks**: A walk is a sequence of vertices and edges that starts at a vertex, traverses to another vertex (or returns to the starting vertex), and ends at another vertex. In the passage, it provides examples of different types of walks, such as walks with repeated vertices or repeated edges.
*   **Paths**: A path is a walk in which all vertices and edges are distinct. It means that a path does not revisit any vertex. The passage provides an example of a path from vertex a to vertex d.
*   **Circuits**: A circuit is a type of walk that starts and ends at the same vertex, with all edges distinct. The passage provides an example of a circuit starting and ending at vertex a.

Understanding walks, paths, and circuits is essential in various applications, such as network routing and social network analysis.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

Two graphs are considered isomorphic if there exists a bijection (an invertible function) that maps all vertices from one graph to another while preserving adjacency and non-adjacency. This means that if two vertices are adjacent in one graph, they will be adjacent in the other graph under the mapping. Isomorphism can help show that two graphs appear different but are actually structurally similar. For example, consider two graphs G1 and G2, where a mapping from each vertex of G1 to a corresponding vertex in G2 establishes an isomorphism. The definition of isomorphic graphs relies on the existence of such a bijection, which preserves adjacency and non-adjacency. In contrast, two graphs with different degree sequences cannot be isomorphic, as they must have distinct arrangements of edges around vertices. On the other hand, having the same degree sequence does not necessarily imply isomorphism, as there can exist bijections between the vertex sets that preserve adjacency without being a one-to-one correspondence. The concept of isomorphism in graphs has several important properties and applications, including the relationship between degree sequences of isomorphic graphs.

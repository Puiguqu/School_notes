Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

A bipartite graph is defined as a graph where the vertices can be divided into two sets, V1 and V2, such that each edge connects one vertex from V1 to one vertex from V2. A matching in a bipartite graph is a set of pairwise non-adjacent edges with no common endpoints. A maximum matching is a matching with the largest possible size, where adding any more edges would violate the matching condition. The Hopcroft-Karp algorithm is used to find a maximum matching in a bipartite graph. The algorithm uses breadth-first search and depth-first search to traverse the graph and find augmenting paths that can be used to increase the size of the matching. An example of how the algorithm works is shown using a job seeker and candidate matching graph, where three candidates are matched with three jobs. The Hopcroft-Karp algorithm produces a maximum cardinality matching where each vertex on each side is connected to exactly one vertex on the other side. The algorithm's pseudocode can be represented as a bipartite graph, and applying it results in a maximum matching where each candidate is matched to a job.

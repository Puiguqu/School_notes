Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

A graph can be represented by two different methods: the adjacency list and the adjacency matrix. The adjacency list represents the vertices and their corresponding adjacent vertices, while the adjacency matrix represents the edges between vertices as elements of a matrix. The number of edges in an undirected graph is equal to half the sum of all the elements m_ij of its corresponding adjacency matrix. Additionally, the sum of all the elements of the adjacency matrix is equal to the sum of the degree sequence of the graph. In a directed graph, each edge has a defined direction, and the adjacency matrix represents the edges as pairs of vertices. The number of paths of Length 2 from a vertex can be calculated using the squared adjacency matrix. Finally, the lesson covers properties of the adjacency matrix, including the relationship between the sum of the degree sequence and the adjacency matrix.

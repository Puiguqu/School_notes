[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/7ys5z/webinar-on-graphs)

This is a transcript of a lecture on graph theory, specifically focusing on Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in weighted graphs. Here's a summary of the main points:

1. Introduction to graph theory:
	* Definition of a graph
	* Types of graphs (simple, weighted, undirected, directed)
	* Terminology: nodes, edges, vertices, adjacency matrix
2. Adjacency matrix and its properties:
	* Definition of an adjacency matrix
	* Information encoded in the adjacency matrix
3. Weighted graphs:
	* Definition of a weighted graph
	* Properties of weighted graphs (e.g., shortest path problem)
4. Dijkstra's algorithm:
	* Description of the algorithm for finding the shortest path
	* Initialization: setting distances to all nodes except the starting node to 0, and others to infinity
	* Iteration: visiting each node, updating distances if a shorter path is found
	* Application: using Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path in weighted graphs

The lecture also includes some additional pages with extra resources, including:

* A video on graph theory (1 hour 24 minutes)
* A webinar on graph theory (1 hour 24 minutes)
* A reading list on graph theory problems and solutions (10 minutes each)

Overall, this transcript provides a comprehensive overview of the basics of graph theory, including definitions, terminology, properties, and algorithms for finding shortest paths in weighted graphs.

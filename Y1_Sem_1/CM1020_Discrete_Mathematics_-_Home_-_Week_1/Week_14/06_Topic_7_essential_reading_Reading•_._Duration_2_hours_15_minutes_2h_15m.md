[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/supplement/4zFdG/topic-7-essential-reading)

There is no text provided to summarize. The given text appears to be a table of contents or a course outline for a lesson on graph theory, covering topics such as adjacency matrices, isomorphic graphs, bipartite graphs, and Dijkstra's algorithm. It includes links to relevant videos, practice assignments, reading materials, and extra resources.

If you provide the actual text, I can help summarize it in 8 sentences while preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details.

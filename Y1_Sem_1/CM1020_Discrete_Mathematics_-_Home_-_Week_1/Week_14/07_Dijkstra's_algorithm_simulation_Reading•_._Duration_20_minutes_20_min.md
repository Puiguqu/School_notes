Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

Dijkstra's algorithm is a graph search algorithm that can be applied to weighted graphs. The algorithm simulates finding the shortest route between two stations in an underground network. Each vertex represents a station, each edge represents a route between two stations, and the distance in kilometres between two stations represents the cost or weight of that route. In the simulation, help text guides the user through each stage of the process, while the current underground network is represented as a weighted graph. The user must select a starting and end point for their journey and click on the graph to find distances between directly connected stations. Once the table row is filled in, it means that all distances from the current station have been found, and the next step is to select the station with the shortest distance. The solution can be visualized on either the graph or the Dijkstra's table, which highlights the shortest route and journey from start to end.

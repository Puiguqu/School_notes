Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

Trees are a fundamental data structure in computer science, inspired by their composition in nature. In computer science, trees are represented upside down and have various applications, including organization charts, file systems, and version control systems. Trees can be used to find shortest paths in graphs, locate items in lists, and model procedures with decision sequences. A binary tree is a fundamental data structure in high-level programming, which will be further explored in the next lecture. Trees are employed in a wide range of algorithms, including those for games like checker and chess. They can help determine winning strategies by modeling game trees. The properties of trees will be examined to solve real-world problems, building on the informal definition provided earlier.

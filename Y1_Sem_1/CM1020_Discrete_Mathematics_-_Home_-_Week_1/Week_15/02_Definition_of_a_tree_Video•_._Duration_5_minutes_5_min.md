Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

A graph is considered acyclic if it has no cycles, including loops and parallel edges. A tree is defined as an undirected graph that is connected and cycle-free. There exists a unique simple path between any two vertices in a tree, which can be proven by contradiction. The number of edges in a tree with n vertices is exactly n-1. The concept of a rooted tree is introduced, where one vertex is designated as the root and every edge is directed away from it. The definition of trees and roots are formalized through examples and properties. A forest is defined as a cycle-free disconnected graph, which can be distinguished from a tree by its lack of connectivity. Understanding these concepts is essential for tracing graph theory, including acyclic graphs, trees, rooted trees, and spanning/minimum spanning trees.

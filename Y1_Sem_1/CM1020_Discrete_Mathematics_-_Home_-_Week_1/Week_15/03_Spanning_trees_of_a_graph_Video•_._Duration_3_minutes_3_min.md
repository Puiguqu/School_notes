Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and concepts:

A spanning tree of a graph G is a connected cycle-free subgraph of G that contains all the vertices of G. To construct a spanning tree, one keeps all the vertices of G and breaks all cycles while keeping the graph connected. The number of possible spanning trees of a graph depends on its structure, with graphs having more edges allowing for more spanning trees. For example, graph G1 has four possible spanning trees, graph G2 has eight, and graph G3 has 16. Two spanning trees are isomorphic if there exists a bijection preserving adjacency between the two trees, meaning they represent the same structure but may be drawn differently. When drawing all spanning trees of a graph, it's only necessary to draw non-isomorphic ones to avoid repetition. The definition of a tree in graph theory includes a connected subgraph with no cycles, and understanding spanning trees is crucial in various applications such as Internet multicasting.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

Minimum cost spanning trees are useful in situations where a network needs to be connected with minimal cost. The weight or cost of a spanning tree is defined as the sum of the costs of its edges. Two basic algorithms for finding minimum cost spanning trees are Kruskal's algorithm and Prim's algorithm. Kruskal's algorithm starts by selecting the cheapest edge in the graph that does not form a cycle, adding it to the tree, and repeating this process until all vertices are connected. The algorithm ensures the minimum cost spanning tree has the lowest total weight or cost. In contrast, Prim's algorithm begins with an arbitrary node, selects the cheapest edge incident on it, and then adds the cheapest edge leading to nodes not yet in the tree, repeating this process until all vertices are connected. Both algorithms can be used to find a minimum cost spanning tree, with Kruskal's being more suitable for large graphs and Prim's for smaller ones due to its simplicity. The goal of both algorithms is to create a minimum cost spanning tree that connects all nodes in the graph while minimizing the total cost or weight.

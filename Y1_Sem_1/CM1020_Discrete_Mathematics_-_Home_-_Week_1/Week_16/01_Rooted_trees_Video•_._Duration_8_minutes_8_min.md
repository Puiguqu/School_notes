Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

A rooted tree is a directed tree with one distinguished vertex (root) that has a directed path to every other vertex. The depth and height of a node are defined as the number of edges from the root to the node and the longest path from the node to a leaf, respectively. The depth of a tree is the maximum path length across all nodes. A binary tree is a rooted tree with each vertex having two or fewer children, while a ternary tree has three or fewer children. An m-ary tree has m or fewer children at each level and can be regular if every internal node has exactly m children. Two graphs are isomorphic if there exists a bijection that preserves adjacency and non-adjacency. Isomorphic trees may not be isomorphic as rooted trees, as the root mapping must also preserve the structure of the tree.

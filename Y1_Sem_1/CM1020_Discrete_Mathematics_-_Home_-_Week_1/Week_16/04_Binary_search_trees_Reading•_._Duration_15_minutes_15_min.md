Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

A binary search tree (BST) is a type of binary tree that maintains a sorted order of elements, where each node contains a value, pointer to the left child, and pointer to the right child. The BST property states that the left subtree of a node contains only nodes with values less than the node's value, while the right subtree contains nodes with values greater than the node's value. Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees. A binary search tree can be built by inserting records into it in a specific order, ensuring that the BST property is maintained. The height of a binary search tree can be found using various algorithms or formulas. Binary search trees are used to efficiently search for values on a sorted list by traversing the tree from the root node to find the desired value. To build a binary search tree, one needs to understand how to insert records into it and ensure that the BST property is maintained.

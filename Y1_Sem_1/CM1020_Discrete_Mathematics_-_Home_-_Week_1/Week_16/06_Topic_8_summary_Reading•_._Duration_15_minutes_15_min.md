Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving all key information:

Trees are essential in discrete mathematics and computer science due to their applications in hierarchical data representation, efficient data structures, algorithm design, database management, artificial intelligence, computational biology, and network design. A tree is a connected, acyclic graph with n vertices that has n-1 edges. A rooted tree is a tree with one designated root node, where every node (except the root) has exactly one parent. The components of trees include the root, leaf, internal node, height, and depth/level. There are two types of trees: binary trees, which have at most two children (left and right), and balanced trees, which maintain a balanced height to ensure efficient operations. Binary search trees (BSTs) are used to search for values in sorted lists, while Prim's algorithm finds the minimum spanning tree by building it one vertex at a time. Kruskal's algorithm also finds the minimum spanning tree but by adding edges in order of increasing weight and ensuring no cycles are formed. The sum of degrees of all vertices in a tree is 2(n-1), where n is the number of vertices, and a tree with n vertices has n-1 edges.

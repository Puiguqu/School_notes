## Rooted trees Video• . Duration: 8 minutes 8 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/i1CY9/rooted-trees)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

A rooted tree is a directed tree with one distinguished vertex (root) that has a directed path to every other vertex. The depth and height of a node are defined as the number of edges from the root to the node and the longest path from the node to a leaf, respectively. The depth of a tree is the maximum path length across all nodes. A binary tree is a rooted tree with each vertex having two or fewer children, while a ternary tree has three or fewer children. An m-ary tree has m or fewer children at each level and can be regular if every internal node has exactly m children. Two graphs are isomorphic if there exists a bijection that preserves adjacency and non-adjacency. Isomorphic trees may not be isomorphic as rooted trees, as the root mapping must also preserve the structure of the tree.

## Binary search trees Video• . Duration: 14 minutes 14 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/XYlri/binary-search-trees)

I can provide a solution to the problem based on the provided transcript.

The problem is not explicitly stated in the transcript, but it appears that the task is to understand and summarize the content of the lecture on binary search trees.

Here's a summary of the key points:

1. Definition of Binary Search Trees:
A binary search tree (BST) is a data structure consisting of nodes arranged in a binary tree, where each node has at most two children (i.e., left child and right child). Each node represents a value or key, and the left subtree of a node contains values less than the node's value, while the right subtree contains values greater than the node's value.

2. Uses of Binary Search Trees:
BSTs are used in various applications, including:
	* Database indexing
	* File systems
	* Web search engines
	* Compilers

3. Building a Binary Search Tree:
To build a BST, we start with an empty tree and recursively add nodes to the left or right of existing nodes, ensuring that the left subtree of a node contains values less than the node's value.

4. Relationship between Number of Stored Records and Height of the Binary Tree:
The height of a binary tree is directly related to the number of stored records. As the number of stored records increases, the height of the tree also increases.

5. Binary Search Algorithm:
The binary search algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the search space in half until the target value is found. It starts by comparing the search element to the middle term of the list and then splits the list into two smaller sub-lists based on the comparison result.

Let's assume that the task is to write a summary of the lecture on binary search trees. Here's a possible answer:

Binary Search Trees are data structures consisting of nodes arranged in a binary tree, where each node represents a value or key. BSTs are used in various applications, including database indexing, file systems, and web search engines.

To build a BST, we start with an empty tree and recursively add nodes to the left or right of existing nodes, ensuring that the left subtree of a node contains values less than the node's value.

The binary search algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the search space in half until the target value is found. It starts by comparing the search element to the middle term of the list and then splits the list into two smaller sub-lists based on the comparison result.

I hope this summary meets your requirements!

## Rooted trees Reading• . Duration: 15 minutes 15 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/supplement/1PwaC/rooted-trees)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences:

Rooted trees are a fundamental concept in graph theory with applications in computer science, data structures, and algorithms. Understanding rooted trees enables tackling problems involving hierarchical structures and recursive data. Key concepts include the definition of a rooted tree, identifying its components (root, parent, child, sibling, leaf, internal nodes), and understanding tree levels and height. There are different types of rooted trees, including binary trees with at most two children, balanced trees like AVL trees and Red-Black trees, and binary search trees (BSTs). BSTs facilitate efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations by maintaining a balanced structure. The lesson covers the basics of rooted trees and binary search trees, including video lectures, reading materials, practice assignments, and discussion prompts. Understanding rooted trees equips students with skills to tackle problems involving hierarchical structures and recursive data in computer science and algorithms.

## Binary search trees Reading• . Duration: 15 minutes 15 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/supplement/FTdMQ/binary-search-trees)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

A binary search tree (BST) is a type of binary tree that maintains a sorted order of elements, where each node contains a value, pointer to the left child, and pointer to the right child. The BST property states that the left subtree of a node contains only nodes with values less than the node's value, while the right subtree contains nodes with values greater than the node's value. Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees. A binary search tree can be built by inserting records into it in a specific order, ensuring that the BST property is maintained. The height of a binary search tree can be found using various algorithms or formulas. Binary search trees are used to efficiently search for values on a sorted list by traversing the tree from the root node to find the desired value. To build a binary search tree, one needs to understand how to insert records into it and ensure that the BST property is maintained.

## Topic 8 summary Reading• . Duration: 15 minutes 15 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/supplement/3rT20/topic-8-summary)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving all key information:

Trees are essential in discrete mathematics and computer science due to their applications in hierarchical data representation, efficient data structures, algorithm design, database management, artificial intelligence, computational biology, and network design. A tree is a connected, acyclic graph with n vertices that has n-1 edges. A rooted tree is a tree with one designated root node, where every node (except the root) has exactly one parent. The components of trees include the root, leaf, internal node, height, and depth/level. There are two types of trees: binary trees, which have at most two children (left and right), and balanced trees, which maintain a balanced height to ensure efficient operations. Binary search trees (BSTs) are used to search for values in sorted lists, while Prim's algorithm finds the minimum spanning tree by building it one vertex at a time. Kruskal's algorithm also finds the minimum spanning tree but by adding edges in order of increasing weight and ensuring no cycles are formed. The sum of degrees of all vertices in a tree is 2(n-1), where n is the number of vertices, and a tree with n vertices has n-1 edges.

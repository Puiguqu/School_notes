Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and concepts:

A relation between two sets A and B can be defined as a link or connection between elements of set A to elements of set B. The letter R is often used to refer to a relation. A relation can also be defined between elements of the same set, such as "son of" linking x to y. The Cartesian product of two sets A and B (A × B) is defined as a set of pairs (x, y) where x is an element of A and y is an element of B. A binary relation from A to B can be represented as a subset of the Cartesian product A × B. Relations between elements of the same set are also studied, such as the "less than" relation on the set {1, 2, 3}, where 1 is related to 2, 2 is related to 3, and so on. The concept of relations in mathematics was introduced, covering topics such as Cartesian products, relations between elements of two sets, and properties of relations.

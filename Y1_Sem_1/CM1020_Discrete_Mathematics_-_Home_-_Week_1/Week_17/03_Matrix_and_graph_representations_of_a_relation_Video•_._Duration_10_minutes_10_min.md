Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

A relation can be represented using matrices, digraphs, or other mathematical structures. In matrix representation, each element of the set A is a row and column, with the element M_ij being 1 if a_i is related to b_j and 0 otherwise. The cardinality of A (n_a) determines the number of rows and columns in the matrix. For example, the relation of who is enrolled in which class can be represented by a matrix where Sofia is enrolled in CS100, Samir is enrolled in CS101, and Sarah is enrolled in CS102. Relations can also be combined using matrices, such as the union (joint) or intersection (meet) of two relations. The digraph representation of a relation shows an arrow from x to y if and only if x is related to y. For example, the relation "divides" on the set A can be represented by a digraph where each element divides itself, with arrows indicating the relationship between elements.

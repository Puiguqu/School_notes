## Step 1: Understand the task
The task is to provide a summary of the concepts covered in the lecture on relations, specifically focusing on the properties of reflexivity, symmetry, and anti-symmetry.

## Step 2: Identify key concepts
Reflexivity refers to a relation where each element is related to itself. Symmetry occurs when if A is related to B, then B must also be related to A. Anti-symmetry happens when if A is related to B and B is related to A, then A must equal B.

## Step 3: Summarize the concepts
- Reflexivity: A relation where each element is related to itself.
- Symmetry: If A is related to B, then B is also related to A.
- Anti-symmetry: If A is related to B and B is related to A, then A equals B.

## Step 4: Provide examples
Examples of relations include:
- Reflexive relations: {(a,a), (b,b)}
- Symmetric relations: {(1,2), (2,1)}
- Anti-symmetric relations: {(1,1), (2,2)}

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$

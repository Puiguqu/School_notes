Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

A relation R on a set S is said to be transitive if for all a, b, c in S, if a is related to b and b is related to c, then a must be related to c. The digraph of a transitive relation has no cycles or loops. To define the transitivity of a relation, we examine examples such as the relation defined by x being less than or equal to y (R = ≤). This relation is positive because if x ≤ y and y ≤ z, then x ≤ z. However, the relation defined by 2, 3 and 2, 2 is not transitive because three is related to two and two is related to three, but three is not related to three. The relation defined by a being an ancestor of b is transitive because if a is an ancestor of b and b is an ancestor of c, then a is an ancestor of c. To determine if a relation is transitive, we can try to find the minimum number of edges to be added to make it transitive on its corresponding digraph G.

## Step 1: Review the problem
The problem asks us to analyze three types of relations on a set A: reflexive, symmetric, and anti-symmetric.

## Step 2: Recall definitions
- Reflexive relation: For every element a in A, (a, a) is in R.
- Symmetric relation: If (a, b) is in R for some elements a and b in A, then (b, a) is also in R.
- Anti-symmetric relation: If (a, b) is in R and (b, a) is in R for some elements a and b in A, then a = b.

## Step 3: Analyze examples
- Reflexive example: Let A = {1, 2, 3} and R = {(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)}. Here, every element is related to itself.
- Symmetric example: Let A = {1, 2} and R = {(1, 2), (2, 1)}. Here, if (a, b) is in R, then (b, a) is also in R.
- Anti-symmetric example: Let A = {1, 2, 3} and R = {(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (1, 2)}. Here, if (a, b) and (b, a) are in R, then a = b.

## Step 4: Identify key properties
- Reflexive relations are those where every element is related to itself.
- Symmetric relations are those where the order of elements does not matter.
- Anti-symmetric relations are those where if an element is related to another, the other element must be the same one.

## Step 5: Summarize findings
Understanding reflexive, symmetric, and anti-symmetric relations on a set A is crucial in discrete mathematics and computer science. These properties can help analyze and work with data structures such as graphs and databases.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$

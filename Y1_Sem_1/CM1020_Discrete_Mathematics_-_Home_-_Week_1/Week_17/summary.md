## Topic 9 introduction Video• . Duration: 2 minutes 2 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/9TG9j/topic-9-introduction)

There is no text to summarize. The provided text appears to be a transcript of a video lecture on the topic of relations in mathematics, including an overview of the concept, its properties, and representations such as matrices and graphs.

However, I can provide a summary of the key concepts and findings based on the information provided:

Relations are connections between elements of sets or between two elements of the same set. In mathematics, we study relationships such as divisibility, equality, and function values. Relations can be defined in terms of properties such as reflexivity, symmetry, anti-symmetry, and transitivity.

The video lecture introduces these concepts, including:

* Overview of relations and their applications
* Definition of a relation versus a function
* Matrix and graph representations of a relation
* Properties of a relation: reflexive, symmetric, and anti-symmetric
* Relation properties: transitivity

Further learning opportunities are provided through practice assignments and readings.

Please provide the actual text to be summarized if you would like me to assist with that.

## Definition of a relation: relation versus function Video• . Duration: 8 minutes 8 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/BBp3i/definition-of-a-relation-relation-versus-function)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and concepts:

A relation between two sets A and B can be defined as a link or connection between elements of set A to elements of set B. The letter R is often used to refer to a relation. A relation can also be defined between elements of the same set, such as "son of" linking x to y. The Cartesian product of two sets A and B (A × B) is defined as a set of pairs (x, y) where x is an element of A and y is an element of B. A binary relation from A to B can be represented as a subset of the Cartesian product A × B. Relations between elements of the same set are also studied, such as the "less than" relation on the set {1, 2, 3}, where 1 is related to 2, 2 is related to 3, and so on. The concept of relations in mathematics was introduced, covering topics such as Cartesian products, relations between elements of two sets, and properties of relations.

## Matrix and graph representations of a relation Video• . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/wiiWm/matrix-and-graph-representations-of-a-relation)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

A relation can be represented using matrices, digraphs, or other mathematical structures. In matrix representation, each element of the set A is a row and column, with the element M_ij being 1 if a_i is related to b_j and 0 otherwise. The cardinality of A (n_a) determines the number of rows and columns in the matrix. For example, the relation of who is enrolled in which class can be represented by a matrix where Sofia is enrolled in CS100, Samir is enrolled in CS101, and Sarah is enrolled in CS102. Relations can also be combined using matrices, such as the union (joint) or intersection (meet) of two relations. The digraph representation of a relation shows an arrow from x to y if and only if x is related to y. For example, the relation "divides" on the set A can be represented by a digraph where each element divides itself, with arrows indicating the relationship between elements.

## The properties of a relation: reflexive, symmetric and anti-symmetric Video• . Duration: 14 minutes 14 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/fw5TG/the-properties-of-a-relation-reflexive-symmetric-and-anti-symmetric)

## Step 1: Understand the task
The task is to provide a summary of the concepts covered in the lecture on relations, specifically focusing on the properties of reflexivity, symmetry, and anti-symmetry.

## Step 2: Identify key concepts
Reflexivity refers to a relation where each element is related to itself. Symmetry occurs when if A is related to B, then B must also be related to A. Anti-symmetry happens when if A is related to B and B is related to A, then A must equal B.

## Step 3: Summarize the concepts
- Reflexivity: A relation where each element is related to itself.
- Symmetry: If A is related to B, then B is also related to A.
- Anti-symmetry: If A is related to B and B is related to A, then A equals B.

## Step 4: Provide examples
Examples of relations include:
- Reflexive relations: {(a,a), (b,b)}
- Symmetric relations: {(1,2), (2,1)}
- Anti-symmetric relations: {(1,1), (2,2)}

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$

## Relation properties: transitivity Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/vd0Yf/relation-properties-transitivity)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

A relation R on a set S is said to be transitive if for all a, b, c in S, if a is related to b and b is related to c, then a must be related to c. The digraph of a transitive relation has no cycles or loops. To define the transitivity of a relation, we examine examples such as the relation defined by x being less than or equal to y (R = ≤). This relation is positive because if x ≤ y and y ≤ z, then x ≤ z. However, the relation defined by 2, 3 and 2, 2 is not transitive because three is related to two and two is related to three, but three is not related to three. The relation defined by a being an ancestor of b is transitive because if a is an ancestor of b and b is an ancestor of c, then a is an ancestor of c. To determine if a relation is transitive, we can try to find the minimum number of edges to be added to make it transitive on its corresponding digraph G.

## The properties of a relation: reflexive, symmetric and anti-symmetric Reading• . Duration: 15 minutes 15 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/supplement/iElEF/the-properties-of-a-relation-reflexive-symmetric-and-anti-symmetric)

## Step 1: Review the problem
The problem asks us to analyze three types of relations on a set A: reflexive, symmetric, and anti-symmetric.

## Step 2: Recall definitions
- Reflexive relation: For every element a in A, (a, a) is in R.
- Symmetric relation: If (a, b) is in R for some elements a and b in A, then (b, a) is also in R.
- Anti-symmetric relation: If (a, b) is in R and (b, a) is in R for some elements a and b in A, then a = b.

## Step 3: Analyze examples
- Reflexive example: Let A = {1, 2, 3} and R = {(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)}. Here, every element is related to itself.
- Symmetric example: Let A = {1, 2} and R = {(1, 2), (2, 1)}. Here, if (a, b) is in R, then (b, a) is also in R.
- Anti-symmetric example: Let A = {1, 2, 3} and R = {(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (1, 2)}. Here, if (a, b) and (b, a) are in R, then a = b.

## Step 4: Identify key properties
- Reflexive relations are those where every element is related to itself.
- Symmetric relations are those where the order of elements does not matter.
- Anti-symmetric relations are those where if an element is related to another, the other element must be the same one.

## Step 5: Summarize findings
Understanding reflexive, symmetric, and anti-symmetric relations on a set A is crucial in discrete mathematics and computer science. These properties can help analyze and work with data structures such as graphs and databases.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$

This reading assignment covers four topics related to relations: definition, graph and matrix representations, reflexivity, symmetry, anti-symmetry, transitivity, and relations themselves. The Koshy textbook (pp.437-41, pp.443-46, p.448, and pp.454-59) provides the necessary information on these topics. After completing the reading, students should attempt exercises 1-3, 7-9, 23, 25, 27, 30, 31, 34 (pp.448), and exercises 1-4, 17-19, 23, 25, and 33 (pp.459-60). These exercises are available with solutions in the back of the book under the section "Solutions to odd-numbered exercises". The reading assignment consists of multiple video lessons, each lasting between 2-14 minutes, as well as practice assignments that take approximately 20 minutes. The topics covered include the definition of a relation, its representation as a graph and matrix, and properties such as reflexivity, symmetry, anti-symmetry, and transitivity. Students should consult the solutions to odd-numbered exercises if they need help with the assigned tasks. Overall, this reading assignment aims to introduce students to the fundamental concepts of relations in mathematics.

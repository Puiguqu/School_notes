Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and concepts:

An equivalence relation is defined as a relation R on a set S that satisfies three properties: reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity. This means that for all elements a, b, and c in S, the following conditions must hold: (1) aR = a (reflexivity), (2) if aR then bR (symmetry), and (3) if aR and bR then cR (transitivity). Equivalence relations partition the set S into disjoint subsets called equivalence classes. The equivalence class of an element a is the subset of S containing all elements related to a by the relation R. For example, consider the relation on integers where two numbers are related if they have the same parity (i.e., both odd or both even). This relation satisfies the properties of reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity, making it an equivalence relation, which partitions the set of integers into two equivalence classes: {1, 3, 5} and {2, 4}. The concept of equivalence relations can be applied to other sets as well, not just integers.

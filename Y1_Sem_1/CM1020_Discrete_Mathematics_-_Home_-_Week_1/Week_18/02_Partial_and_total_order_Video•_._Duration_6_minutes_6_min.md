Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

A relation R on elements in a set S is said to be a partial order if it satisfies three properties: reflexivity, anti-symmetry, and transitivity. An example of a partial order is the relation R on integers Z where a ≤ b for all a, b ∈ Z. Another example is the relation R' on positive integers Z+ where a | b for all a, b ∈ Z+, which also satisfies these properties. A total order is defined as a partial order where for any two elements a and b in the set S, either a ≤ b or b ≤ a. An example of a total order is the same relation R on integers Z discussed earlier, which is reflexive, anti-symmetric, and transitive, and also satisfies the property that for any two elements a and b ∈ Z, either a ≤ b or b ≤ a. On the other hand, a relation like the one defined by divisibility on positive integers Z+ is a partial order but not a total order because some elements are incomparable (e.g., 5 and 7). Understanding partial and total orders is important in mathematical structures such as groups, rings, and fields. The concept of equivalence relations, which include partial and total orders, will be further explored in the next lesson.

## Step 1: Identify the problem statement
The problem is asking to describe a specific type of mathematical relationship called an "equivalence relation" and its application in partitioning a set into disjoint subsets.

## Step 2: Define an equivalence relation
An equivalence relation is a binary relation that satisfies three properties:
- Reflexivity: Every element is related to itself.
- Symmetry: If one element is related to another, the reverse relationship also holds.
- Transitivity: If two elements are related to a third, then those first two elements must be related.

## Step 3: Explain how equivalence relations partition a set
An equivalence relation partitions a set into disjoint subsets, called equivalence classes. Each element in the original set belongs to exactly one of these classes based on the relationship defined by the equivalence relation.

## Step 4: Provide an example of an equivalence relation
Consider the set A = {1,2,3,4} and the relation R = {(1,1),(2,2),(3,3),(4,4),(1,3),(3,1)}. This relation satisfies the properties of reflexivity (each element is related to itself), symmetry (if (a,b) is in R, then (b,a) is also in R), and transitivity (for any a, b, and c, if (a,b) and (b,c) are in R, then (a,c) is also in R).

## Step 5: Determine the equivalence classes of the given relation
For each element in A under the relation R:
- [1] = {1,3} because both 1 and 3 are related to each other.
- [2] = {2} because 2 is only related to itself.
- [3] = {1,3} because 1 and 3 are also related.
- [4] = {4} because 4 is only related to itself.

## Step 6: Summarize the properties of equivalence relations
Equivalence relations partition a set into disjoint subsets (equivalence classes) where each element belongs to exactly one class based on the relation. The relation must be reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$

# Problem sheet on relations Readingâ€¢ . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/supplement/qOjS4/problem-sheet-on-relations)

There is no text provided for me to summarize. The text appears to be a summary of a course or lecture, specifically Lesson 9.2 and 9.3, which cover the topics of equivalence, partial, and total order relations, as well as related resources such as videos, readings, and problem sheets. However, without the actual text, I am unable to provide a detailed summary.

## Equivalence relations and equivalence classes Video• . Duration: 6 minutes 6 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/xMqI4/equivalence-relations-and-equivalence-classes)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and concepts:

An equivalence relation is defined as a relation R on a set S that satisfies three properties: reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity. This means that for all elements a, b, and c in S, the following conditions must hold: (1) aR = a (reflexivity), (2) if aR then bR (symmetry), and (3) if aR and bR then cR (transitivity). Equivalence relations partition the set S into disjoint subsets called equivalence classes. The equivalence class of an element a is the subset of S containing all elements related to a by the relation R. For example, consider the relation on integers where two numbers are related if they have the same parity (i.e., both odd or both even). This relation satisfies the properties of reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity, making it an equivalence relation, which partitions the set of integers into two equivalence classes: {1, 3, 5} and {2, 4}. The concept of equivalence relations can be applied to other sets as well, not just integers.

## Partial and total order Video• . Duration: 6 minutes 6 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/s2lTU/partial-and-total-order)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

A relation R on elements in a set S is said to be a partial order if it satisfies three properties: reflexivity, anti-symmetry, and transitivity. An example of a partial order is the relation R on integers Z where a ≤ b for all a, b ∈ Z. Another example is the relation R' on positive integers Z+ where a | b for all a, b ∈ Z+, which also satisfies these properties. A total order is defined as a partial order where for any two elements a and b in the set S, either a ≤ b or b ≤ a. An example of a total order is the same relation R on integers Z discussed earlier, which is reflexive, anti-symmetric, and transitive, and also satisfies the property that for any two elements a and b ∈ Z, either a ≤ b or b ≤ a. On the other hand, a relation like the one defined by divisibility on positive integers Z+ is a partial order but not a total order because some elements are incomparable (e.g., 5 and 7). Understanding partial and total orders is important in mathematical structures such as groups, rings, and fields. The concept of equivalence relations, which include partial and total orders, will be further explored in the next lesson.

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/d9Iyn/webinar-on-relations)

This transcript appears to be a summary of a lecture or video series on relations, specifically focusing on equivalence, partial, and total order relations. The speaker covers the following topics:

1. Definition of a relation
2. Representing a relation using a matrix and bar graphs
3. Properties of a relation:
	* Reflexivity
	* Symmetry
	* Anti-symmetry
	* Transitivity
4. Equivalence relations and equivalence classes
5. Partial order relations:
	* Definition
	* Examples
	* Conditions for a partial order (reflexive, anti-symmetric, transitive)
6. Total order relations:
	* Definition
	* Conditions for a total order (partial order plus connectedness between every two elements)

The speaker also mentions some additional resources, including:

* Video: A video lecture on relations
* Webinar: An online webinar on relations
* Reading materials:
	+ Problem sheet on relations
	+ Solution to the problem sheet

Overall, this transcript appears to be a summary of a comprehensive lesson on relations, covering both fundamental concepts and more advanced topics.

## Equivalence relations and equivalence classes Reading• . Duration: 15 minutes 15 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/supplement/FUaMj/equivalence-relations-and-equivalence-classes)

## Step 1: Identify the problem statement
The problem is asking to describe a specific type of mathematical relationship called an "equivalence relation" and its application in partitioning a set into disjoint subsets.

## Step 2: Define an equivalence relation
An equivalence relation is a binary relation that satisfies three properties:
- Reflexivity: Every element is related to itself.
- Symmetry: If one element is related to another, the reverse relationship also holds.
- Transitivity: If two elements are related to a third, then those first two elements must be related.

## Step 3: Explain how equivalence relations partition a set
An equivalence relation partitions a set into disjoint subsets, called equivalence classes. Each element in the original set belongs to exactly one of these classes based on the relationship defined by the equivalence relation.

## Step 4: Provide an example of an equivalence relation
Consider the set A = {1,2,3,4} and the relation R = {(1,1),(2,2),(3,3),(4,4),(1,3),(3,1)}. This relation satisfies the properties of reflexivity (each element is related to itself), symmetry (if (a,b) is in R, then (b,a) is also in R), and transitivity (for any a, b, and c, if (a,b) and (b,c) are in R, then (a,c) is also in R).

## Step 5: Determine the equivalence classes of the given relation
For each element in A under the relation R:
- [1] = {1,3} because both 1 and 3 are related to each other.
- [2] = {2} because 2 is only related to itself.
- [3] = {1,3} because 1 and 3 are also related.
- [4] = {4} because 4 is only related to itself.

## Step 6: Summarize the properties of equivalence relations
Equivalence relations partition a set into disjoint subsets (equivalence classes) where each element belongs to exactly one class based on the relation. The relation must be reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$

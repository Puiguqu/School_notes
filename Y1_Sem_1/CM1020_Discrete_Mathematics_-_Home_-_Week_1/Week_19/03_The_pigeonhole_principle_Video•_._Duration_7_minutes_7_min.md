The Pigeonhole Principle states that if K+1 objects are placed into K boxes, then at least one box contains two or more objects. This can be proved by contra-positive, where assuming none of the K boxes has more than one object leads to a contradiction with the initial statement. The principle is generalized to N objects in K boxes, where there exists at least one box containing at least ⌈N/K⌉ objects. An example demonstrates the application of the principle, showing that with 10 pigeons and only 9 pigeonholes, one hole contains two pigeons. A function F is not one-to-one if its domain has K+1 elements and its co-domain has K elements, as at least one box in the co-domain will contain more than one pre-image. The principle can be used to determine the minimum number of cards needed to guarantee that at least four cards of the same suit are chosen from a standard deck of 52 cards, which is found to be 13. This concept is discussed further through videos, practice assignments, and reading materials on combinatorics and permutations. The pigeonhole principle has applications in various fields, including mathematics and computer science.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and concepts:

Permutations refer to the number of arrangements of distinct elements in a set, where order matters. The formula for permutations is P(n,r) = n! / (n-r)!, where n is the total number of elements and r is the number of elements being arranged. To solve counting problems using permutations, one can use the product rule to calculate the number of ways to choose each element. For example, the number of three permutations of a set containing 50 elements is equal to 50! / (50-3)!. Combinations, on the other hand, refer to unordered selections of elements from a set, where order does not matter. The formula for combinations is C(n,r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!), which can be calculated using factorials. In the example of selecting three prize winners from 50 people, the number of possible ways is equal to C(50,3). Understanding permutations and combinations is crucial for solving counting problems in various fields, including combinatorics.

There is no text provided for me to summarize. The given text appears to be a list of exercise and video topics from a textbook, but it does not contain any specific information or content that needs to be summarized. If you provide the actual text, I would be happy to help you summarize it in 8 sentences, preserving all key information, formulae, links, and technical details.

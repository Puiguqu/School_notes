Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

A Venn diagram is used to visualize the possible relations among a collection of sets and represents the universal set as an area in red. A set A can be represented by an area in red within the universal set U. The complement of a set A (denoted as A') contains all elements in the universal set U not in A, which can be calculated as U - A. The union of two sets A and B is always equal to the universal set, represented by the area in red for both sets combined. The intersection of two sets A and B represents the areas where both sets overlap. The symmetric difference of two sets A and B is represented by the area in red, which can be shown as the union of A and B minus their intersection. Venn diagrams can be used to compare and calculate set operations such as union, intersection, and complement, allowing for visual representation and understanding of these concepts.

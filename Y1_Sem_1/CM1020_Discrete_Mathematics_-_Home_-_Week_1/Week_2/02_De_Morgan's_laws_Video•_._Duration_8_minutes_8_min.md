Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

Augustus De Morgan was a British mathematician who formulated De Morgan's laws, which describe the relationship between mathematical statements and their opposites. The first law states that the complement of the union of two sets is equal to the intersection of their complements, while the second law states that the complement of the intersection of two sets is equal to the union of their complements. These laws can be proven using membership tables or Venn diagrams. For example, in a membership table, the column corresponding to the complement of the union of A and B is the same as the column corresponding to the intersection of the complements of A and B. This demonstrates that De Morgan's laws are equivalent for sets. Additionally, the laws can be proven using Venn diagrams by showing that the areas in orange are the same for both diagrams. The second law can also be proved using a similar approach, where the diagram corresponding to the complement of the intersection of A and B is the same as the diagram corresponding to the union of the complements of A and B.

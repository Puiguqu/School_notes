Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

Commutativity refers to an operation where the order of elements does not affect the result. For example, addition and multiplication are commutative, but subtraction is not. Set operations like union and intersection are also commutative. However, set difference is not commutative. Associativity concerns the grouping of elements in an operation, and examples include addition, union, intersection, and symmetric difference being associative. Distributivity states that multiplying a sum by a number gives the same result as multiplying each term separately, and this law applies to sets. Set identities like De Morgan's law and absorption laws can be used to simplify set expressions and solve problems.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

A partition of an object is a subdivision into parts that are completely separated from each other while forming the whole object. Data partitioning has applications in big data analysis. Two sets A and B are disjoint if their intersection is equal to the empty set, as shown in the Venn diagram. A partition of a set A is a collection of subsets A_i that are disjoint and whose union equals A. The given example illustrates this concept with subsets A_1 to A_5 of set A, where each subset is disjoint from the others and their union forms A. To determine if a given collection of subsets is a partition of a set S containing five elements {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, one must check that all subsets are mutually disjoint and their union equals S. The first option is not a correct partition because the subset {3, 4} intersects with the subset {4, 5}. Similarly, other options fail to meet the criteria of being mutually disjoint or having a union equal to S.

Note: I didn't include links, formulae, or technical details that were not essential for understanding the main concept of partitioning a set. If you'd like me to clarify anything or add more information, please let me know!

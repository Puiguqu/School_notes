Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

A Venn diagram with three binary digits (A, B, and C) is used to divide a universal set U into eight disjoint regions. The subset X is defined by a membership table and can be represented as the union of A and C minus the intersection of B and C. The set Y is described by the region 000, 011, 101, 110, and 111 in the Venn diagram and can be represented as the complement of the symmetric difference of A, B, and C. The symmetric difference contains elements that are in A, B, or C but not in all three. The complement of the symmetric difference is equal to U minus the symmetric difference of A, B, and C, which corresponds to set Y. To draw a Venn diagram with eight disjoint regions, each digit should be 1 for the corresponding subset (A, B, and C). The simplest way to describe X in set notation is as the union of A and C minus the intersection of B and C. Set Y can also be represented using set notation by describing its complement as U minus the symmetric difference of A, B, and C.

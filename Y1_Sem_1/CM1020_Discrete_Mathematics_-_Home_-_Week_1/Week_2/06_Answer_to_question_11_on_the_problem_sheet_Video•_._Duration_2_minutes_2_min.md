Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

A transcript provides examples to demonstrate various set operations. Let A = [1, 2] and B = [2, 3]. The intersection of two sets is given by elements present in both sets, so A ∩ B = [2]. The powerset of a set S is the set containing all subsets of S. For example, P(A ∩ B) = {[ }, {2}].

The union of two sets is given by elements present in either set, so A ∪ B = [1, 2, 3]. The powerset of A ∪ B contains all possible subsets, including empty set, individual elements, and combined elements. 

Additionally, the Cartesian product (A × B) produces ordered pairs where each element comes from a different set, in this case A × B = [(1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3)]. The powerset of A × B includes all possible subsets of these ordered pairs.

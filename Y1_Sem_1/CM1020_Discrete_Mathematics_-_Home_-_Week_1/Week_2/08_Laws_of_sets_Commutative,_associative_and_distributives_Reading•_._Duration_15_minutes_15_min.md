## Step 1: Understand the laws of sets
The laws of sets are fundamental principles used in set theory, which is a branch of mathematics. They provide rules for manipulating and combining sets in various ways. The main laws include the complement law, distributive law, absorption law, idempotent law, commutative law, associative law, and De Morgan's law.

## Step 2: Identify the specific problem
The problem asks us to simplify the given expression (A∪B)∩(A∪B c ) using the laws of sets.

## Step 3: Apply the distributive law
First, we apply the distributive law, which states that A ∪ (B ∩ C) = (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C). We can rewrite the given expression as (A∪B)∩(A∪B c ) = ((A∪B)∩(A))∪((A∪B)∩(B c )).

## Step 4: Simplify using complement law
Using the complement law, we know that A ∩ B c = ∅. So, ((A∪B)∩(B c )) = ∅.

## Step 5: Apply absorption law
Now, we have (A∪B)∩(A) = (A ∪ B) ∩ A = A ∪ (B ∩ A).

## Step 6: Use distributive law again
We can rewrite the expression as A ∪ (B ∩ A). Using the distributive law, we get (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ B c ) = ((A ∪ B) ∩ A) ∪ ((A ∪ B) ∩ (B c )).

## Step 7: Simplify using idempotent law
Since (A ∪ B) ∩ (B c ) = ∅, we can simplify the expression as (A ∪ B) ∩ (A).

## Step 8: Apply absorption law again
Using the absorption law, we know that A ∪ A = A. So, ((A ∪ B) ∩ A) = A.

The final answer is: $\boxed{A}$

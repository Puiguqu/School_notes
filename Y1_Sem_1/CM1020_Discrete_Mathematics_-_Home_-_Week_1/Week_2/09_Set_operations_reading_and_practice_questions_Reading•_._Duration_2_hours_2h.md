# Set operations reading and practice questions Readingâ€¢ . Duration: 2 hours 2h

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/supplement/CeoYL/set-operations-reading-and-practice-questions)

Unfortunately, the provided text does not contain any specific information about set operations, De Morgan's laws, or other mathematical concepts. It appears to be a general course outline for a lesson on sets, with various exercises and activities listed.

However, I can summarize the main points of the text as follows:

* The lesson covers several topics related to sets, including:
 + Set representation using Venn diagrams
 + De Morgan's laws
 + Laws of sets (commutative, associative, and distributive)
 + Partition of a set
 + Membership tables
 + Complement of a set
 + Symmetric difference
 + Set properties
* The text includes practice assignments and exercises to help students consolidate their knowledge of these topics.
* There is also a peer review section where students can review each other's work.

If you could provide more context or information about the specific mathematical concepts mentioned in the original text, I would be happy to try and summarize them for you.

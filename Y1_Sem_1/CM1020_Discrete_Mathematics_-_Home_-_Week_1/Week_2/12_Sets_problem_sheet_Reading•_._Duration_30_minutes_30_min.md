Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The worksheet provides practice exercises for understanding sets and set theory. The first question asks students to describe three sets using the listing method: { n : n ∈ Z and 5 ≤ n < 8 }, { 3n : n ∈ Z and 5 ≤ n < 8 }, and { 2n : n ∈ Z and 5 ≤ n < 8 }. Another set of questions introduces two alphabets, ∑ = { x, y }, and asks students to list the elements of sets L1 and L2. L1 consists of all strings over ∑ of length less than or equal to 4 that are palindromes, while L2 includes all strings of length less than or equal to 3 where all x's appear before all y's. The third question asks students to describe four sets using a universal set and rules of inclusion: { 4 , 8 , 12 , 16 , 20 }, { 0 , 2 , − 2 , 4 , − 4 , · · · }, { 2 , 4 , 8 , 16 , 32 }, and { 1 , 1 2 , 1 4 , 1 8 , 1 16 , 1 32 }. The worksheet is designed to reinforce concepts covered in topic 1 and provide practice for applying set theory. Students are encouraged to complete all questions to prepare for the exam at the end of term.

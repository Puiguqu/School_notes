Unfortunately, you didn't provide any text for me to summarize. The provided text appears to be a lesson plan or schedule for a course, outlining the duration and content of various video sessions, reading materials, and assessments. It does not contain any specific information on set representation and manipulation or other key concepts. If you could provide the relevant text, I would be happy to assist you in summarizing it into 5 sentences while preserving all key information, formulae, links, and technical details.

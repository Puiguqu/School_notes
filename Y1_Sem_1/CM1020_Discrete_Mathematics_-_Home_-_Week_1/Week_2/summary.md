## The representation of a set using Venn diagrams Video• . Duration: 4 minutes 4 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/MqEpp/the-representation-of-a-set-using-venn-diagrams)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

A Venn diagram is used to visualize the possible relations among a collection of sets and represents the universal set as an area in red. A set A can be represented by an area in red within the universal set U. The complement of a set A (denoted as A') contains all elements in the universal set U not in A, which can be calculated as U - A. The union of two sets A and B is always equal to the universal set, represented by the area in red for both sets combined. The intersection of two sets A and B represents the areas where both sets overlap. The symmetric difference of two sets A and B is represented by the area in red, which can be shown as the union of A and B minus their intersection. Venn diagrams can be used to compare and calculate set operations such as union, intersection, and complement, allowing for visual representation and understanding of these concepts.

## De Morgan's laws Video• . Duration: 8 minutes 8 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/MNAbf/de-morgans-laws)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

Augustus De Morgan was a British mathematician who formulated De Morgan's laws, which describe the relationship between mathematical statements and their opposites. The first law states that the complement of the union of two sets is equal to the intersection of their complements, while the second law states that the complement of the intersection of two sets is equal to the union of their complements. These laws can be proven using membership tables or Venn diagrams. For example, in a membership table, the column corresponding to the complement of the union of A and B is the same as the column corresponding to the intersection of the complements of A and B. This demonstrates that De Morgan's laws are equivalent for sets. Additionally, the laws can be proven using Venn diagrams by showing that the areas in orange are the same for both diagrams. The second law can also be proved using a similar approach, where the diagram corresponding to the complement of the intersection of A and B is the same as the diagram corresponding to the union of the complements of A and B.

## Laws of sets: Commutative, associative and distributives Video• . Duration: 11 minutes 11 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/QEPbf/laws-of-sets-commutative-associative-and-distributives)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

Commutativity refers to an operation where the order of elements does not affect the result. For example, addition and multiplication are commutative, but subtraction is not. Set operations like union and intersection are also commutative. However, set difference is not commutative. Associativity concerns the grouping of elements in an operation, and examples include addition, union, intersection, and symmetric difference being associative. Distributivity states that multiplying a sum by a number gives the same result as multiplying each term separately, and this law applies to sets. Set identities like De Morgan's law and absorption laws can be used to simplify set expressions and solve problems.

## Partition of a set Video• . Duration: 3 minutes 3 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/FuScz/partition-of-a-set)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

A partition of an object is a subdivision into parts that are completely separated from each other while forming the whole object. Data partitioning has applications in big data analysis. Two sets A and B are disjoint if their intersection is equal to the empty set, as shown in the Venn diagram. A partition of a set A is a collection of subsets A_i that are disjoint and whose union equals A. The given example illustrates this concept with subsets A_1 to A_5 of set A, where each subset is disjoint from the others and their union forms A. To determine if a given collection of subsets is a partition of a set S containing five elements {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, one must check that all subsets are mutually disjoint and their union equals S. The first option is not a correct partition because the subset {3, 4} intersects with the subset {4, 5}. Similarly, other options fail to meet the criteria of being mutually disjoint or having a union equal to S.

Note: I didn't include links, formulae, or technical details that were not essential for understanding the main concept of partitioning a set. If you'd like me to clarify anything or add more information, please let me know!

## Answer to question 8 on the problem sheet Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/Zlip3/answer-to-question-8-on-the-problem-sheet)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

A Venn diagram with three binary digits (A, B, and C) is used to divide a universal set U into eight disjoint regions. The subset X is defined by a membership table and can be represented as the union of A and C minus the intersection of B and C. The set Y is described by the region 000, 011, 101, 110, and 111 in the Venn diagram and can be represented as the complement of the symmetric difference of A, B, and C. The symmetric difference contains elements that are in A, B, or C but not in all three. The complement of the symmetric difference is equal to U minus the symmetric difference of A, B, and C, which corresponds to set Y. To draw a Venn diagram with eight disjoint regions, each digit should be 1 for the corresponding subset (A, B, and C). The simplest way to describe X in set notation is as the union of A and C minus the intersection of B and C. Set Y can also be represented using set notation by describing its complement as U minus the symmetric difference of A, B, and C.

## Answer to question 11 on the problem sheet Video• . Duration: 2 minutes 2 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/yFK2d/answer-to-question-11-on-the-problem-sheet)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

A transcript provides examples to demonstrate various set operations. Let A = [1, 2] and B = [2, 3]. The intersection of two sets is given by elements present in both sets, so A ∩ B = [2]. The powerset of a set S is the set containing all subsets of S. For example, P(A ∩ B) = {[ }, {2}].

The union of two sets is given by elements present in either set, so A ∪ B = [1, 2, 3]. The powerset of A ∪ B contains all possible subsets, including empty set, individual elements, and combined elements. 

Additionally, the Cartesian product (A × B) produces ordered pairs where each element comes from a different set, in this case A × B = [(1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3)]. The powerset of A × B includes all possible subsets of these ordered pairs.

## Laws of sets: Commutative, associative and distributives Reading• . Duration: 15 minutes 15 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/supplement/3E79H/laws-of-sets-commutative-associative-and-distributives)

## Step 1: Understand the laws of sets
The laws of sets are fundamental principles used in set theory, which is a branch of mathematics. They provide rules for manipulating and combining sets in various ways. The main laws include the complement law, distributive law, absorption law, idempotent law, commutative law, associative law, and De Morgan's law.

## Step 2: Identify the specific problem
The problem asks us to simplify the given expression (A∪B)∩(A∪B c ) using the laws of sets.

## Step 3: Apply the distributive law
First, we apply the distributive law, which states that A ∪ (B ∩ C) = (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C). We can rewrite the given expression as (A∪B)∩(A∪B c ) = ((A∪B)∩(A))∪((A∪B)∩(B c )).

## Step 4: Simplify using complement law
Using the complement law, we know that A ∩ B c = ∅. So, ((A∪B)∩(B c )) = ∅.

## Step 5: Apply absorption law
Now, we have (A∪B)∩(A) = (A ∪ B) ∩ A = A ∪ (B ∩ A).

## Step 6: Use distributive law again
We can rewrite the expression as A ∪ (B ∩ A). Using the distributive law, we get (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ B c ) = ((A ∪ B) ∩ A) ∪ ((A ∪ B) ∩ (B c )).

## Step 7: Simplify using idempotent law
Since (A ∪ B) ∩ (B c ) = ∅, we can simplify the expression as (A ∪ B) ∩ (A).

## Step 8: Apply absorption law again
Using the absorption law, we know that A ∪ A = A. So, ((A ∪ B) ∩ A) = A.

The final answer is: $\boxed{A}$

## Peer review guidance Reading• . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/supplement/H3d7B/peer-review-guidance)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulas, links, and technical details:

In the Computer Science programme, peer reviews may be part of required assignments, where students evaluate each other's work to provide feedback and learn from one another. There are two parts to peer-graded assignments: submitting your own assignment and grading a minimum number of peers' submissions, which must be completed to receive a grade for your own assignment. When grading a peer's work, you will be provided with a rubric that describes the assignment components and possible grades. The purpose of peer review is not just to critique but to offer constructive feedback that can help authors improve their work. Peer review is valuable in developing critical thinking, fostering collaborative learning, and academic integrity. It also enhances analytical skills, improves writing and research skills, offers new perspectives and ideas, and fosters a sense of community and collaboration. Participating in peer review prepares you for future academic and professional experiences, including scholarly review processes, and provides insight into the review process, which can reduce anxiety and increase competence. By engaging in peer review, you can develop empathy and communication skills, gain confidence in your own academic abilities, and learn from diverse research topics and methodologies.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences:

Set theory is a fundamental area of mathematics that studies collections of objects called sets. It forms the basis for various mathematical disciplines and has applications in computer science, logic, and more. Key concepts in set theory include the definition of a set, its representation using methods such as listing, builder notation, and Venn diagrams, and understanding membership, cardinality, and subsets. There are different types of sets, including empty, finite, and infinite sets, as well as their powersets. Set operations include union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference, with the complement of a set also being an important concept. Laws of set theory include commutative, associative, distributive, identity, complement, absorption, and De Morgan's laws, which can be used to prove relations between sets using Venn diagrams or other methods. To improve understanding of these concepts, it is recommended to review learning outcomes, identify areas for improvement, create an action plan, and implement strategies such as reviewing course materials, practicing problems, seeking help from instructors or peers, and scheduling additional study sessions. By regularly assessing understanding and capabilities against learning outcomes and making adjustments to the plan as needed, individuals can deepen their knowledge of set theory and improve their skills.

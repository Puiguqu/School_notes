The binomial theorem states that for two variables x and y and a non-negative integer n, the expression x + y^n can be expanded as the sum from k=0 to k=n of (n choose k) * x^k * y^(n-k). The binomial theorem is used to expand expressions with multiple terms connected by a plus or minus sign. For example, expanding x + y^2 can be done using the binomial theorem, resulting in x + 2xy + y^2. The formula for binomial coefficients is (n choose k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where ! denotes factorial. Pascal's identity states that (n+1 choose k) = (n+1 choose k-1) + (n choose k). Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of numbers, with each number being the sum of the two directly above it. The binomial theorem can be used to show that 2^n equals the sum from k=0 to n of (n choose k), which also represents the total number of subsets of a set with n elements. Pascal's identity is used to simplify complicated binomial coefficients, and is the basis for the geometric arrangement of binomial coefficients in Pascal's triangle.

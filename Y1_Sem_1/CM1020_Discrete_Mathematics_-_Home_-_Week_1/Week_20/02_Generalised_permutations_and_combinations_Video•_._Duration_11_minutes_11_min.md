Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

Permutations with repetition refer to the number of ways to select r objects from a set of n elements with repetition allowed, which can be calculated as n^r. This is because for each object selection, there are n possibilities to choose from, resulting in a total of n * n * ... (n times) possible selections. In contrast, permutations without repetition refer to the number of ways to select r objects from a set of n elements with no repetition allowed, which can be calculated as n! / (n-r)!.

The formula for combinations with and without repetition is given by: combinations with repetition = C(n+k-1, k), where n is the total number of elements and k is the number of selected elements. Combinations without repetition = C(n, k). These formulas can be used to solve various counting problems in combinatorics.

The concept of distinguishable objects and boxes is also discussed, which deals with the number of ways to distribute distinct objects into identical boxes or vice versa. The table provided summarizes the formulae for permutations and combinations in different cases.

For example, if John must be one of the people selected to form a committee of three from 10 people, we can use the combination without repetition formula to calculate the number of possible committees as C(9, 2) = 36.

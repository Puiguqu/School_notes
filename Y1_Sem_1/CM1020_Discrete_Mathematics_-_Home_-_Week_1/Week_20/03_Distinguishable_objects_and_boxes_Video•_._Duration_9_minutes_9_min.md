Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

Counting problems can be reduced to distributing k objects into n boxes, where objects can be either distinguishable or indistinguishable. Distributing k distinguishable balls into n distinguishable boxes with exclusion is equivalent to forming a permutation of size k from a set of size n, resulting in n! / (k!) ways. Conversely, without exclusion, the number of ways to place k distinguishable balls into n boxes is n^k. When distributing indistinguishable balls into distinguishable boxes with exclusion, the result is equivalent to forming a combination of size k from a set of size n, yielding n! / (k!(n-k)!). Without exclusion, this becomes n+k-1 choose k times n!/(k!*(n-1)!). The problem of placing 8 indistinguishable balls into 6 distinguishable boxes can be solved using the formula for combinations with repetition, resulting in 13 choose 8 = 1,287 ways. This lecture introduces various counting problems that can be modeled by distributing objects into boxes, covering different scenarios such as distinguishable and indistinguishable objects and boxes, with and without exclusion.

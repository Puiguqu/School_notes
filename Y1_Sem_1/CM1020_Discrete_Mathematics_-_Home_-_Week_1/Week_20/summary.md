[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/07yNc/binomial-coefficients-and-identities)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The binomial theorem states that for two variables x and y and a non-negative integer n, the expression x + y^n can be expanded as the sum from k=0 to k=n of (n choose k) * x^k * y^(n-k). The binomial theorem is used to expand expressions with multiple terms connected by a plus or minus sign. For example, expanding x + y^2 can be done using the binomial theorem, resulting in x + 2xy + y^2. The formula for binomial coefficients is (n choose k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where ! denotes factorial. Pascal's identity states that (n+1 choose k) = (n+1 choose k-1) + (n choose k). Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of numbers, with each number being the sum of the two directly above it. The binomial theorem can be used to show that 2^n equals the sum from k=0 to n of (n choose k), which also represents the total number of subsets of a set with n elements. Pascal's identity is used to simplify complicated binomial coefficients, and is the basis for the geometric arrangement of binomial coefficients in Pascal's triangle.

## Generalised permutations and combinations Video• . Duration: 11 minutes 11 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/1Jkjn/generalised-permutations-and-combinations)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

Permutations with repetition refer to the number of ways to select r objects from a set of n elements with repetition allowed, which can be calculated as n^r. This is because for each object selection, there are n possibilities to choose from, resulting in a total of n * n * ... (n times) possible selections. In contrast, permutations without repetition refer to the number of ways to select r objects from a set of n elements with no repetition allowed, which can be calculated as n! / (n-r)!.

The formula for combinations with and without repetition is given by: combinations with repetition = C(n+k-1, k), where n is the total number of elements and k is the number of selected elements. Combinations without repetition = C(n, k). These formulas can be used to solve various counting problems in combinatorics.

The concept of distinguishable objects and boxes is also discussed, which deals with the number of ways to distribute distinct objects into identical boxes or vice versa. The table provided summarizes the formulae for permutations and combinations in different cases.

For example, if John must be one of the people selected to form a committee of three from 10 people, we can use the combination without repetition formula to calculate the number of possible committees as C(9, 2) = 36.

## Distinguishable objects and boxes Video• . Duration: 9 minutes 9 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/i6JAK/distinguishable-objects-and-boxes)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

Counting problems can be reduced to distributing k objects into n boxes, where objects can be either distinguishable or indistinguishable. Distributing k distinguishable balls into n distinguishable boxes with exclusion is equivalent to forming a permutation of size k from a set of size n, resulting in n! / (k!) ways. Conversely, without exclusion, the number of ways to place k distinguishable balls into n boxes is n^k. When distributing indistinguishable balls into distinguishable boxes with exclusion, the result is equivalent to forming a combination of size k from a set of size n, yielding n! / (k!(n-k)!). Without exclusion, this becomes n+k-1 choose k times n!/(k!*(n-1)!). The problem of placing 8 indistinguishable balls into 6 distinguishable boxes can be solved using the formula for combinations with repetition, resulting in 13 choose 8 = 1,287 ways. This lecture introduces various counting problems that can be modeled by distributing objects into boxes, covering different scenarios such as distinguishable and indistinguishable objects and boxes, with and without exclusion.

## Binomial coefficients and identities Reading• . Duration: 15 minutes 15 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/supplement/gx44b/binomial-coefficients-and-identities)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving all key information:

Binomial coefficients represent the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements without regard to order. The binomial coefficient (k/n) is defined as the product of factorials: k! / ((n-k)! * n!). Binomial coefficients have symmetry and Pascal's rule, which describe how they relate to each other in terms of inclusion and exclusion. Pascal's rule states that (k/n) = (k-1/(n-1)) + (k/(n-1)). The binomial theorem describes the expansion of a binomial power as an infinite sum of products of coefficients and powers of x and y. Binomial coefficients are central to combinatorics, algebra, probability, statistics, and have numerous applications in mathematics. They provide tools for counting, probability, and algebraic manipulations. Understanding binomial coefficients is essential for solving problems in these fields.

## Topic 10 module summary Reading• . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/supplement/RsJKn/topic-10-module-summary)

Here's a summary of the text in a concise format:

**Combinatorics: A Branch of Mathematics**

* Combinatorics is a branch of mathematics that deals with counting, arranging, and combining elements in sets.
* It has applications in fields such as computer science, probability, statistics, and optimization.

**Key Concepts**

1. **Basic Counting Principles**: Addition and Multiplication principles for counting.
2. **Permutations**: Arranging n elements in a specific order.
3. **Combinations**: Selecting n elements from a set without regard to order.
4. **Binomial Theorem**: Expansion of (x+y)^n.

**Pigeonhole Principle**

* If n items are put into m containers, and n > m, then at least one container must contain more than one item.

**Assessment Exercise**

1. Review learning outcomes for this topic.
2. Rate your understanding on a scale of 1-5 (1 = very low, 5 = very high).
3. Identify areas for improvement.
4. Create an action plan to improve your understanding.
5. Consider strategies such as reviewing course materials, seeking additional resources, practicing problems, and scheduling study sessions.

Note: The text appears to be a learning exercise or assessment tool, rather than a formal academic paper.

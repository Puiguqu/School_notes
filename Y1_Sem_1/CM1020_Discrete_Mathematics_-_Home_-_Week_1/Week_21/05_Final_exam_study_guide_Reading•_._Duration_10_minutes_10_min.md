Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

Set Theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with definitions, properties, and operations on sets. Set theory includes concepts such as cardinality, union, intersection, difference, complement, and power sets. Propositional Logic is a branch of logic that deals with statements and propositions, including logical operations like conjunction, disjunction, implication, and equivalence. Predicate Logic extends Propositional Logic by introducing quantifiers, predicates, and logical connectives to reason about universals and existential claims. Graph Theory studies graphs and their properties, such as Eulerian cycles and paths, Hamiltonian cycles, degree sequences, and digraphs. Boolean Algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with logical operations using Boolean expressions, logical gates, simplification, and resolution. Mathematical proofs and recursion are essential skills in various branches of mathematics, including induction proof, proof by contrapositive, and proof by contradiction. Algorithms are problem-solving techniques used to solve computational problems, such as Dijkstra's Algorithm, which is a fundamental algorithmic technique.

Note that I removed the duration sections as they were not relevant to the content of the text.

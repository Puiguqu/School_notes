There is no text provided to summarize. The input appears to be a set of study schedules or revision plans, but it lacks any specific information about the content of the courses being studied. If you provide the actual text, I'll be happy to assist you in summarizing it into 6 sentences while preserving key concepts and technical details.

## Final exam key concepts review Reading• . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

This text appears to be a comprehensive overview of various topics in mathematics, including algebra, combinatorics, graph theory, boolean algebra, and algorithms.

Here are some key points that can be extracted from this text:

**Algebra**

* Boolean Algebra is a division of mathematics that deals with operations on logical values.
* The fundamental operations of Boolean Algebra are conjunction (∧), disjunction (∨), and complement (¬).
* Laws of Boolean Algebra include laws such as idempotence, nullity, etc.

**Combinatorics and Graph Theory**

* Permutations: a selection of items from a larger set, where the order of arrangement does not matter.
* Combinations: a selection of items from a larger set, where the order of arrangement matters.
* Euler Paths: a path in a graph that passes through every edge exactly once.
* Euler Cycles: an Euler Path which starts and ends on the same vertex.
* Hamiltonian Path: a path in a graph that visits each vertex exactly once.

**Boolean Algebra**

* Simplification of Boolean Expressions using laws of Boolean Algebra, such as Karnaugh map.
* Logical Gates: AND gate (∧), OR gate (∨), and NOT gate (¬).

**Algorithms**

* Dijkstra's Algorithm: an algorithm used to find the shortest path from one node in a graph to another.

This text provides a broad overview of various topics in mathematics, but does not provide any specific examples or applications. It appears to be more of a theoretical or introductory resource, rather than a practical guide for solving problems.

## Final exam study guide Reading• . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

Set Theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with definitions, properties, and operations on sets. Set theory includes concepts such as cardinality, union, intersection, difference, complement, and power sets. Propositional Logic is a branch of logic that deals with statements and propositions, including logical operations like conjunction, disjunction, implication, and equivalence. Predicate Logic extends Propositional Logic by introducing quantifiers, predicates, and logical connectives to reason about universals and existential claims. Graph Theory studies graphs and their properties, such as Eulerian cycles and paths, Hamiltonian cycles, degree sequences, and digraphs. Boolean Algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with logical operations using Boolean expressions, logical gates, simplification, and resolution. Mathematical proofs and recursion are essential skills in various branches of mathematics, including induction proof, proof by contrapositive, and proof by contradiction. Algorithms are problem-solving techniques used to solve computational problems, such as Dijkstra's Algorithm, which is a fundamental algorithmic technique.

Note that I removed the duration sections as they were not relevant to the content of the text.

# Topic 2 introduction Videoâ€¢ . Duration: 1 minute 1 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/dEASs/topic-2-introduction)

There is no text provided for me to summarize. The text appears to be a transcript of a video or online course about functions in computer programming, but it doesn't contain any specific information that can be summarized.

However, I can provide a general summary of the key concepts and topics mentioned in the text:

Functions are rules that relate one quantity to another and map each input to exactly one output. They are a fundamental concept in computer programming and are used extensively in most programs. The topic will introduce functions, examine function properties, and cover various related topics such as plotting functions, injective and surjective functions, and more.

If you provide the actual text, I would be happy to help summarize it for you.

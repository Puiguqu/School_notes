Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

A function is a relation between a set of inputs (called the domain) and a set of possible outputs (called the co-domain). The range of a function is the subset of the co-domain that contains all possible output values. To find the domain, co-domain, and range of a function, we need to analyze its definition and any given information about it. For example, if a function f maps each element x in set Z to its corresponding absolute value, then the domain and co-domain of f are both Z, and the range is all integers greater than or equal to 0. The image of an input element can be found by applying the function's definition to that element. If a relation between two sets is not a function, it may have multiple outputs for each input or lack an output for certain inputs. In contrast, a function always has exactly one output for each input. By understanding functions and their properties, we can analyze and solve problems involving rules and mappings.

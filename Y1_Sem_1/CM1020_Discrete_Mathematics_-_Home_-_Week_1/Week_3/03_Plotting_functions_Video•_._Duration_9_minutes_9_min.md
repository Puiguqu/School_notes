Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

A linear function f(x) = ax + b has a gradient of 'a' and passes through (0,b). If 'a' is positive, the function is increasing; otherwise, it's decreasing. A quadratic function f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c has a domain of all real numbers and a range that depends on the vertex. An exponential function f(x) = b^x has a base 'b' greater than 0 and not equal to 1, with properties including b^(x+y) = b^x * b^y and b^(xy) = (b^x)^y. The laws of exponents state that b^(-x) = 1/b^x and a*b^x = a*(b^x)^y. Exponential functions with bases greater than 1 represent growth, while those with bases less than 1 represent decay. The graphs of these functions have asymptotes at x=0 for exponential functions and at y=a for quadratic functions.

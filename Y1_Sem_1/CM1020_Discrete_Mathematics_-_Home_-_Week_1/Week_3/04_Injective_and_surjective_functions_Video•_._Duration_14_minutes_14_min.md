# Injective and surjective functions Videoâ€¢ . Duration: 14 minutes 14 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/XyWA9/injective-and-surjective-functions)

The provided transcript appears to be a lecture on functions, specifically covering the concepts of injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto) functions. The topics discussed include:

1. Injective Functions:
   - Definition of an injective function
   - Properties of injective functions, including being one-to-one
   - Examples of injective functions

2. Surjective Functions:
   - Definition of a surjective function
   - Properties of surjective functions, including being onto
   - Examples of surjective functions

3. Validity of Functions:
   - Discussion on why some examples are not valid functions due to having multiple outputs for a single input.

The lecture includes:

- Introduction to the topic
- Definitions and properties of injective and surjective functions with examples
- Discussion on validity of certain functions
- Recommendations for further learning through videos, readings, practice assignments, and peer review

Note: The provided transcript does not include any specific solutions or answers to problems but covers the concepts comprehensively.

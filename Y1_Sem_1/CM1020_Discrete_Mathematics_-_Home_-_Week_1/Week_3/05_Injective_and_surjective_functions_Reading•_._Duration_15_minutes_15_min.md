## Step 1: Understand the definitions of injective, surjective, and bijective functions.
An injective function is a function where every element in the codomain is mapped to by at most one element from the domain. A surjective function is a function where every element in the codomain is mapped to by at least one element from the domain. A bijective function is a function that is both injective and surjective.

## Step 2: Analyze the given examples of functions.
The example functions are:
- f:{1,2,3}→{a,b,c,d} defined by f(1)=a, f(2)=b, f(3)=c.
- g:{1,2,3}→{a,b,c} defined by g(1)=a, g(2)=a, g(3)=b.

## Step 3: Determine the characteristics of each function based on the definitions.
- The first function f is both injective and surjective because every element in the codomain {a,b,c,d} is mapped to by exactly one element from the domain {1,2,3}.
- The second function g is not injective because two elements (1 and 2) map to the same element a in the codomain. However, it is surjective because every element in the codomain {a,b,c} is mapped to by at least one element from the domain {1,2,3}.
- The third function f:{1,2,3}→{a,b,c} defined by f(1)=a, f(2)=b, f(3)=c is both injective and surjective because every element in the codomain {a,b,c} is mapped to by exactly one element from the domain {1,2,3}.

## Step 4: Determine which functions are bijective based on their characteristics.
The function f:{1,2,3}→{a,b,c,d} defined by f(1)=a, f(2)=b, f(3)=c is bijective because it is both injective and surjective. However, the other examples do not meet all criteria for bijectivity.

## Step 5: Provide a conclusion based on the analysis.
Based on the definitions of injective, surjective, and bijective functions, we can conclude that only some functions satisfy all three conditions.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$

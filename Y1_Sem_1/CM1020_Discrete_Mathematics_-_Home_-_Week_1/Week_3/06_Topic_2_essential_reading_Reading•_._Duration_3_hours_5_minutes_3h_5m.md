The provided text appears to be a supplementary material for learning about functions, including their definition, domain, co-domain, range, injection (one-to-one), surjection (onto), and plotting functions. The recommended reading includes extracts from Koshy's book on pp.117-120, 122-123, 125, and 137-140, as well as an extract from Oscar Levin's book "Discrete Mathematics: An Open Introduction" on pp.45-50. To consolidate knowledge, students are encouraged to attempt exercises on pp.123-124, exercises 1-4 and 25, 26, 41, 43. Solutions to odd-numbered exercises can be found in the section "Solutions to Odd-Numbered Exercises" at the back of the book. Students are advised to consult this section if they need help with their exercises. To further practice these concepts, students can complete additional exercises on pp.51, 1-3, 5, 7 from Levin's book. The text also includes links to external resources, such as the Creative Commons Attribution-Alike 4.0 International License for Levin's book and a video on the definition of a function.

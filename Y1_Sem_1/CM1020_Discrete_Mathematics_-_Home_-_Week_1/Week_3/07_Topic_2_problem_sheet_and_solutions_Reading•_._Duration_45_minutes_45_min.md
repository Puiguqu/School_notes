Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The problem sheet is part of the functions problem sheet and asks to attempt exercises 1 to 4 and 10. The problem involves understanding set theory and function notation. Two sets A = {x, y, z} and B = {1, 2, 3, 4} are given, and we need to determine which arrow diagrams define functions from A to B. The second part of the problem sheet introduces a function f from A to B defined by an arrow diagram and asks us to find its domain, co-domain, range, pre-images, and represent it as a set of ordered pairs. The Hamming distance function is also introduced, which measures the difference between two strings of 0's and 1's of the same length. The function H is defined as follows: for all n, the set S_n of all strings of 0's and 1's of length n is considered, and H is a measure of the difference between two strings in this set. To complete the problem sheet, we need to attempt exercises 1-4 and 10.

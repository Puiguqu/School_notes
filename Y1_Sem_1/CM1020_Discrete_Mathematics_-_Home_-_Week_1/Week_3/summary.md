## Topic 2 introduction Video• . Duration: 1 minute 1 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/dEASs/topic-2-introduction)

There is no text provided for me to summarize. The text appears to be a transcript of a video or online course about functions in computer programming, but it doesn't contain any specific information that can be summarized.

However, I can provide a general summary of the key concepts and topics mentioned in the text:

Functions are rules that relate one quantity to another and map each input to exactly one output. They are a fundamental concept in computer programming and are used extensively in most programs. The topic will introduce functions, examine function properties, and cover various related topics such as plotting functions, injective and surjective functions, and more.

If you provide the actual text, I would be happy to help summarize it for you.

## The definition of a function Video• . Duration: 11 minutes 11 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/wAGof/the-definition-of-a-function)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

A function is a relation between a set of inputs (called the domain) and a set of possible outputs (called the co-domain). The range of a function is the subset of the co-domain that contains all possible output values. To find the domain, co-domain, and range of a function, we need to analyze its definition and any given information about it. For example, if a function f maps each element x in set Z to its corresponding absolute value, then the domain and co-domain of f are both Z, and the range is all integers greater than or equal to 0. The image of an input element can be found by applying the function's definition to that element. If a relation between two sets is not a function, it may have multiple outputs for each input or lack an output for certain inputs. In contrast, a function always has exactly one output for each input. By understanding functions and their properties, we can analyze and solve problems involving rules and mappings.

## Plotting functions Video• . Duration: 9 minutes 9 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/LJ9wV/plotting-functions)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

A linear function f(x) = ax + b has a gradient of 'a' and passes through (0,b). If 'a' is positive, the function is increasing; otherwise, it's decreasing. A quadratic function f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c has a domain of all real numbers and a range that depends on the vertex. An exponential function f(x) = b^x has a base 'b' greater than 0 and not equal to 1, with properties including b^(x+y) = b^x * b^y and b^(xy) = (b^x)^y. The laws of exponents state that b^(-x) = 1/b^x and a*b^x = a*(b^x)^y. Exponential functions with bases greater than 1 represent growth, while those with bases less than 1 represent decay. The graphs of these functions have asymptotes at x=0 for exponential functions and at y=a for quadratic functions.

## Injective and surjective functions Reading• . Duration: 15 minutes 15 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/supplement/t9YrS/injective-and-surjective-functions)

## Step 1: Understand the definitions of injective, surjective, and bijective functions.
An injective function is a function where every element in the codomain is mapped to by at most one element from the domain. A surjective function is a function where every element in the codomain is mapped to by at least one element from the domain. A bijective function is a function that is both injective and surjective.

## Step 2: Analyze the given examples of functions.
The example functions are:
- f:{1,2,3}→{a,b,c,d} defined by f(1)=a, f(2)=b, f(3)=c.
- g:{1,2,3}→{a,b,c} defined by g(1)=a, g(2)=a, g(3)=b.

## Step 3: Determine the characteristics of each function based on the definitions.
- The first function f is both injective and surjective because every element in the codomain {a,b,c,d} is mapped to by exactly one element from the domain {1,2,3}.
- The second function g is not injective because two elements (1 and 2) map to the same element a in the codomain. However, it is surjective because every element in the codomain {a,b,c} is mapped to by at least one element from the domain {1,2,3}.
- The third function f:{1,2,3}→{a,b,c} defined by f(1)=a, f(2)=b, f(3)=c is both injective and surjective because every element in the codomain {a,b,c} is mapped to by exactly one element from the domain {1,2,3}.

## Step 4: Determine which functions are bijective based on their characteristics.
The function f:{1,2,3}→{a,b,c,d} defined by f(1)=a, f(2)=b, f(3)=c is bijective because it is both injective and surjective. However, the other examples do not meet all criteria for bijectivity.

## Step 5: Provide a conclusion based on the analysis.
Based on the definitions of injective, surjective, and bijective functions, we can conclude that only some functions satisfy all three conditions.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$

The provided text appears to be a supplementary material for learning about functions, including their definition, domain, co-domain, range, injection (one-to-one), surjection (onto), and plotting functions. The recommended reading includes extracts from Koshy's book on pp.117-120, 122-123, 125, and 137-140, as well as an extract from Oscar Levin's book "Discrete Mathematics: An Open Introduction" on pp.45-50. To consolidate knowledge, students are encouraged to attempt exercises on pp.123-124, exercises 1-4 and 25, 26, 41, 43. Solutions to odd-numbered exercises can be found in the section "Solutions to Odd-Numbered Exercises" at the back of the book. Students are advised to consult this section if they need help with their exercises. To further practice these concepts, students can complete additional exercises on pp.51, 1-3, 5, 7 from Levin's book.

## Topic 2 problem sheet and solutions Reading• . Duration: 45 minutes 45 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/supplement/dQ2uS/topic-2-problem-sheet-and-solutions)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The problem sheet is part of the functions problem sheet and asks to attempt exercises 1 to 4 and 10. The problem involves understanding set theory and function notation. Two sets A = {x, y, z} and B = {1, 2, 3, 4} are given, and we need to determine which arrow diagrams define functions from A to B. The second part of the problem sheet introduces a function f from A to B defined by an arrow diagram and asks us to find its domain, co-domain, range, pre-images, and represent it as a set of ordered pairs. The Hamming distance function is also introduced, which measures the difference between two strings of 0's and 1's of the same length. The function H is defined as follows: for all n, the set S_n of all strings of 0's and 1's of length n is considered, and H is a measure of the difference between two strings in this set. To complete the problem sheet, we need to attempt exercises 1-4 and 10.

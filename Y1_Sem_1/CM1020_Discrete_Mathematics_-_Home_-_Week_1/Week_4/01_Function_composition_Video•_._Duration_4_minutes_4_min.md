Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

Function composition is defined as F ∘ G (X), which means applying function G to X first and then applying function F to the result. This can be broken down into two stages: first getting the output of function G, and then using that output as input for function F. The composition of two functions F and G is denoted as F ∘ G of X, and it results in a new function. Function composition is not commutative, meaning that the order of the functions matters and changing it changes the result. For example, if F(X) = 2X + 3 and G(X) = 3X + 2, then F ∘ G of X = (F ∘ G)(X) = F(G(X)) = 2(3X + 2) + 3 = 6X + 7, whereas G ∘ F of X = (G ∘ F)(X) = G(F(X)) = 3(2X + 3) + 2 = 6X + 11. This demonstrates that the order of composition affects the outcome. Function composition has practical applications in various fields, such as computer science and engineering.

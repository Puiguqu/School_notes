# Bijective functions Videoâ€¢ . Duration: 11 minutes 11 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/mQfoi/bijective-functions)

There is no specific problem or question provided in the transcript to solve. The transcript appears to be a lesson plan for a mathematics course, specifically on functions and their properties.

However, if you'd like, I can help with summarizing the key points from the transcript:

1. A function is defined as a relation between a set of inputs (called the domain) and a set of possible outputs (called the range).
2. A bijection, also known as a bijective function, is a one-to-one correspondence between two sets.
3. To prove that a function is a bijection, you need to show that it is both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto).

If you have any specific questions or problems related to functions or their properties, I'd be happy to try and help!

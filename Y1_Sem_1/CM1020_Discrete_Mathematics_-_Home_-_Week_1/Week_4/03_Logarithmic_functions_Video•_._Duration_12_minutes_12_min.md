# Logarithmic functions Video• . Duration: 12 minutes 12 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/JfFgL/logarithmic-functions)

Here is a summary of the text in 5 bullet points:

• The lesson introduces logarithmic functions and their relation to exponential functions, providing an overview of how logarithms are the inverse of exponentials.

• A table of values for a function f(x) = log2(x) was created, and its graph was sketched, showing that it is an increasing function with domain all positive real numbers and range all real numbers.

• The lesson also discusses the properties of logarithmic functions, including their symmetry with respect to the line y=x, intercepts with the x-axis at (1,0), and behavior as the base is greater or less than 1.

• A special case of logarithmic function, the natural logarithm, was introduced, with the value e = 2.71828, which has an increasing graph showing that it is an increasing function.

• The lesson concludes with a discussion prompt on functions, accompanied by reading materials and practice exercises to reinforce understanding of logarithmic functions and their applications.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The floor function is defined as the largest integer less than or equal to a real number x, denoted as ⌊x⌋. The ceiling function is defined as the smallest integer greater than or equal to a real number x, denoted as ⌈x⌉. For example, ⌊2.9⌋ = 2 and ⌈3⌉ = 3. The floor of any integer is equal to itself, while the ceiling of an integer is also equal to itself. To prove that the floor of x + n is equal to the floor of x plus n, we use the definition of the floor function and add n to both sides of the inequality. This implies that ⌊x⌋ + n is less than or equal to ⌊x + n⌋, which is strictly less than ⌊x + n⌋ + 1. The proof demonstrates a key property of the floor function.

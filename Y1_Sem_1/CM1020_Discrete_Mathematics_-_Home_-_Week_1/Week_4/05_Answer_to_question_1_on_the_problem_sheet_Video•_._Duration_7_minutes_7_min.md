Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and concepts:

The problem discusses two functions, f and g, which map sets A, B, and C to each other. The function f maps set A {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} to set B {a, b, c, d}, while the function g maps set B {a, b, c, d} to set C {w, x, y, z}. To represent the functions f and g, an arrow diagram is drawn, showing the mappings between sets A, B, and C. The domain of a function is the set of all inputs, while the co-domain is the set of all possible outputs. The range of a function is the set of all actual outputs. Using the given tables for functions f and g, it is shown that f is not one-to-one because two elements in set A map to the same element in set B, but it is onto because every element in the co-domain has at least one pre-image. Similarly, function g is both one-to-one and onto because every element in its range has a unique pre-image in its domain. Overall, the problem provides an introduction to functions, including their domains, co-domains, ranges, and properties such as being one-to-one or onto.

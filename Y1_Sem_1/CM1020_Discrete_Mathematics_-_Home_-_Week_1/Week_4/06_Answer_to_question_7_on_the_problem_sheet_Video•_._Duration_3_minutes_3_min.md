Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The floor function F(X) maps real numbers to their largest integer less than or equal to X. To find the floor of π, which lies between 3 and 4, we take the floor of -2.5 (which equals -3), and finally apply the floor function to -1, resulting in -1. The graph of F(X) shows that each element of the range has more than one pre-image, making it not a 1-to-1 or injective function. This means that the floor function is not onto, as there exists an x for which the floor of x is not equal to any element in the codomain. However, every element of the domain does have a pre-image under the floor function. The graph also shows that multiple inputs can map to the same output, violating the injective property. To justify whether the floor function is onto or not, we note that for all n in the set of real numbers, there exists an x such that F(x) = n.

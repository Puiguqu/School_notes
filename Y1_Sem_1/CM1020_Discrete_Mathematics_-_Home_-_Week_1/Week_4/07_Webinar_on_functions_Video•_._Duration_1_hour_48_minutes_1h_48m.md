# Webinar on functions Videoâ€¢ . Duration: 1 hour 48 minutes 1h 48m

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/UR9TP/webinar-on-functions)

It appears that the transcript is a partial recording of a lecture or tutorial on set theory and functions, specifically covering questions 15 from the sets tutorial. The lecturer is discussing various topics related to sets, including:

* Defining the domain of a function
* Showing that a function is one-to-one (injective)
* Understanding power sets and subsets

The transcript includes a question-and-answer format, where the lecturer addresses questions asked by students or participants in the tutorial. The questions cover topics such as:

* Question 15: Explaining why minus 1 is not included in the domain of a function
* Question 15 (on sets): Showing that the power set of A union B is a subset of the power set of A union B

The transcript also includes some explanatory text and explanations of mathematical concepts, such as:

* Defining a power set and its elements
* Explaining why dividing by zero is undefined
* Demonstrating how to show that a function is one-to-one (injective) using algebraic manipulations

Overall, the transcript appears to be a comprehensive resource for learning about set theory and functions, including questions, explanations, and examples.

# Functions reading and practice exercises Readingâ€¢ . Duration: 1 hour 1h

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/supplement/EFDUr/functions-reading-and-practice-exercises)

There is no text provided for me to summarize. The text appears to be a list of video and practice assignments related to functions, including function composition, bijections, logarithmic functions, and the floor and ceiling functions. It also mentions exercises and solutions for these topics, as well as a discussion prompt and summative assessment.

If you provide the actual text, I would be happy to help summarize it in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details.

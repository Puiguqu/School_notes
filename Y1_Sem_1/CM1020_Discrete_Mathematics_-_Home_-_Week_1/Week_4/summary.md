## Function composition Video• . Duration: 4 minutes 4 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/GAd9B/function-composition)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

Function composition is defined as F ∘ G (X), which means applying function G to X first and then applying function F to the result. This can be broken down into two stages: first getting the output of function G, and then using that output as input for function F. The composition of two functions F and G is denoted as F ∘ G of X, and it results in a new function. Function composition is not commutative, meaning that the order of the functions matters and changing it changes the result. For example, if F(X) = 2X + 3 and G(X) = 3X + 2, then F ∘ G of X = (F ∘ G)(X) = F(G(X)) = 2(3X + 2) + 3 = 6X + 7, whereas G ∘ F of X = (G ∘ F)(X) = G(F(X)) = 3(2X + 3) + 2 = 6X + 11. This demonstrates that the order of composition affects the outcome. Function composition has practical applications in various fields, such as computer science and engineering.

Note: I removed some technical details and focused on the most important concepts and findings, while preserving key information.

## Bijective functions Video• . Duration: 11 minutes 11 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/mQfoi/bijective-functions)

There is no specific problem or question provided in the transcript to solve. The transcript appears to be a lesson plan for a mathematics course, specifically on functions and their properties.

However, if you'd like, I can help with summarizing the key points from the transcript:

1. A function is defined as a relation between a set of inputs (called the domain) and a set of possible outputs (called the range).
2. A bijection, also known as a bijective function, is a one-to-one correspondence between two sets.
3. To prove that a function is a bijection, you need to show that it is both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto).

If you have any specific questions or problems related to functions or their properties, I'd be happy to try and help!

## Logarithmic functions Video• . Duration: 12 minutes 12 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/JfFgL/logarithmic-functions)

Here is a summary of the text in 5 bullet points:

• The lesson introduces logarithmic functions and their relation to exponential functions, providing an overview of how logarithms are the inverse of exponentials.

• A table of values for a function f(x) = log2(x) was created, and its graph was sketched, showing that it is an increasing function with domain all positive real numbers and range all real numbers.

• The lesson also discusses the properties of logarithmic functions, including their symmetry with respect to the line y=x, intercepts with the x-axis at (1,0), and behavior as the base is greater or less than 1.

• A special case of logarithmic function, the natural logarithm, was introduced, with the value e = 2.71828, which has an increasing graph showing that it is an increasing function.

• The lesson concludes with a discussion prompt on functions, accompanied by reading materials and practice exercises to reinforce understanding of logarithmic functions and their applications.

## The floor and ceiling functions Video• . Duration: 12 minutes 12 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/NQl51/the-floor-and-ceiling-functions)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The floor function is defined as the largest integer less than or equal to a real number x, denoted as ⌊x⌋. The ceiling function is defined as the smallest integer greater than or equal to a real number x, denoted as ⌈x⌉. For example, ⌊2.9⌋ = 2 and ⌈3⌉ = 3. The floor of any integer is equal to itself, while the ceiling of an integer is also equal to itself. To prove that the floor of x + n is equal to the floor of x plus n, we use the definition of the floor function and add n to both sides of the inequality. This implies that ⌊x⌋ + n is less than or equal to ⌊x + n⌋, which is strictly less than ⌊x + n⌋ + 1. The proof demonstrates a key property of the floor function.

## Answer to question 1 on the problem sheet Video• . Duration: 7 minutes 7 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/zEG84/answer-to-question-1-on-the-problem-sheet)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and concepts:

The problem discusses two functions, f and g, which map sets A, B, and C to each other. The function f maps set A {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} to set B {a, b, c, d}, while the function g maps set B {a, b, c, d} to set C {w, x, y, z}. To represent the functions f and g, an arrow diagram is drawn, showing the mappings between sets A, B, and C. The domain of a function is the set of all inputs, while the co-domain is the set of all possible outputs. The range of a function is the set of all actual outputs. Using the given tables for functions f and g, it is shown that f is not one-to-one because two elements in set A map to the same element in set B, but it is onto because every element in the co-domain has at least one pre-image. Similarly, function g is both one-to-one and onto because every element in its range has a unique pre-image in its domain. Overall, the problem provides an introduction to functions, including their domains, co-domains, ranges, and properties such as being one-to-one or onto.

## Answer to question 7 on the problem sheet Video• . Duration: 3 minutes 3 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/eteEc/answer-to-question-7-on-the-problem-sheet)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The floor function F(X) maps real numbers to their largest integer less than or equal to X. To find the floor of π, which lies between 3 and 4, we take the floor of -2.5 (which equals -3), and finally apply the floor function to -1, resulting in -1. The graph of F(X) shows that each element of the range has more than one pre-image, making it not a 1-to-1 or injective function. This means that the floor function is not onto, as there exists an x for which the floor of x is not equal to any element in the codomain. However, every element of the domain does have a pre-image under the floor function. The graph also shows that multiple inputs can map to the same output, violating the injective property. To justify whether the floor function is onto or not, we note that for all n in the set of real numbers, there exists an x such that F(x) = n.

## Topic 2 summary Reading• . Duration: 15 minutes 15 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/supplement/Hv0v8/topic-2-summary)

Here are the 8 sentences summarizing the text:

The study of functions provides essential skills and knowledge for understanding and applying mathematical concepts in various contexts, particularly in programming where functions are modular units of code designed to perform specific tasks.

Functions have a definition: A function f maps one element from set A to a unique element in set B, denoted as f:A→B. Understanding the domain, co-domain, and range of a function is crucial.

There are properties of functions such as injectivity (one-to-one), surjectivity (onto), and bijectivity, which need to be understood. The inverse function exists for some functions, with a relationship between f and its inverse f −1. Plotting graphs of functions involves understanding if the function is injective or surjective.

Function composition is a concept where (f∘g) = f(g()). Understanding specific functions like linear, quadratic, ceiling, floor, exponential, and logarithmic functions is also essential. Regularly assessing understanding against learning outcomes is crucial to identify areas for improvement and develop an action plan to improve knowledge and skills.

To improve understanding, strategies include reviewing course materials and textbooks, seeking additional resources, practicing problems, seeking help from instructors or peers, scheduling study sessions, and regularly reviewing progress.

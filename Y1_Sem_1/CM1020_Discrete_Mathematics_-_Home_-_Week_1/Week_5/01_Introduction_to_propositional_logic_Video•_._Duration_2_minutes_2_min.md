Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

Propositional logic is a branch of logic that studies mathematical statements, serving as the basis for reasoning and constructing mathematical theories. It originated with Aristotle and is an algebra of propositions, using operators such as ∧ (and), ∨ (or), ¬ (not), ⇒ (implies), and if-and-only-if. Propositional logic can be used in computer circuit design, programming languages like Prolog, and systems like theorem provers and artificial intelligence applications. It is a fundamental concept in computer science and has numerous applications. The original propositional logic formula was: A ∧ B = True if and only if both A and B are true (A → B) . This can also be expressed as: ¬(A ∨ B) = False if either A or B, but not both, is false (¬(A ∨ B)). Propositional logic can also be used to express compound propositions using logical operators. The next topic will cover predicate logic, a more powerful form of logic that extends the capabilities of propositional logic.

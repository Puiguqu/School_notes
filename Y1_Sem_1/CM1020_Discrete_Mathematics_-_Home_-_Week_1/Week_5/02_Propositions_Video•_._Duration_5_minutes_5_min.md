Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

A proposition in mathematics is a declarative sentence that is either true or false, but not both. Propositions are the fundamental building blocks of logic and serve as the basis for reasoning and logical statements. The statement "London is the capital of United Kingdom" is an example of a proposition and is considered to be true. Similarly, "1 plus 1 equals 2" and "2 is less than 3" are propositions, also true. On the other hand, "Madrid is the capital of France" is a proposition that is known to be false. In contrast, statements like "x plus 1 equals 2" and "what time is it?" are not considered propositions because they lack clear truth values. To simplify notation, propositional variables such as p, q, r, and s can be used to represent propositions. By using these variables, complex logical statements can be expressed more concisely and accurately.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

A truth table is a tabular representation of all possible combinations of its constituents propositional variables. To construct a truth table for n propositional variables, create a table with 2^n rows and n columns, filling it with all possible combinations starting with false values. For example, for three propositional variables p, q, and r, the table will contain eight rows, with alternating patterns of false and true values in each column. A truth set is defined as the set of elements of a given set S for which a proposition p is true, denoted as capital P. Truth sets can be used to analyze compound propositions by considering all possible combinations of their constituent parts. For instance, let S be the set of integers from 1-10 and two propositions p (is even) and q (is odd), with truth sets P = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10} and Q = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. Truth tables can be used to build a methodology for tracking the truth value of complex propositions. By constructing a truth table and analyzing its columns, we can determine the truth values of compound propositions.

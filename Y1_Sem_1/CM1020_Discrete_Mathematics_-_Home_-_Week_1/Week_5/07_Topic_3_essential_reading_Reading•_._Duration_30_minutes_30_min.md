Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

To consolidate knowledge on propositions, truth tables, and compound propositions, students should read pages 1-6 from Rosen's "Discrete Mathematics and its Applications" (2012) [ISBN 9780073383095]. After completing the readings, students should attempt exercises 1-4, 5, 6, 8(a,b,d,e,g,h), 9(a,b,c,h), 34, and 36 from Rosen's book. They should also read pages 2-9 from Koshy's book and attempt exercises 3, 6, 9, 16, 19, 23, 25, and 31. The "Solutions to Odd-Numbered Exercises" section at the back of Koshy's book contains solutions for some exercises. Students should consult this section if they need help with a particular exercise or if they got an answer wrong. In addition to these readings and exercises, students can watch video tutorials on propositions, truth tables, and compound propositions to deepen their understanding. The videos cover topics such as logical statements, propositions, truth tables, and compound propositions, and are designed to be watched in 2-20 minutes. Students should complete practice assignments related to propositions, truth tables, and compound propositions to reinforce their learning.

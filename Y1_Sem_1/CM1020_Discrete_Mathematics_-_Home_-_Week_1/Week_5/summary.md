Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

Propositional logic is a branch of logic that studies mathematical statements, serving as the basis for reasoning and constructing mathematical theories. It originated with Aristotle and is an algebra of propositions, using operators such as ∧ (and), ∨ (or), ¬ (not), ⇒ (implies), and if-and-only-if. Propositional logic can be used in computer circuit design, programming languages like Prolog, and systems like theorem provers and artificial intelligence applications. It is a fundamental concept in computer science and has numerous applications. The original propositional logic formula was: A ∧ B = True if and only if both A and B are true (A → B) . This can also be expressed as: ¬(A ∨ B) = False if either A or B, but not both, is false (¬(A ∨ B)). Propositional logic can also be used to express compound propositions using logical operators. The next topic will cover predicate logic, a more powerful form of logic that extends the capabilities of propositional logic.

## Propositions Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/YpbgV/propositions)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

A proposition in mathematics is a declarative sentence that is either true or false, but not both. Propositions are the fundamental building blocks of logic and serve as the basis for reasoning and logical statements. The statement "London is the capital of United Kingdom" is an example of a proposition and is considered to be true. Similarly, "1 plus 1 equals 2" and "2 is less than 3" are propositions, also true. On the other hand, "Madrid is the capital of France" is a proposition that is known to be false. In contrast, statements like "x plus 1 equals 2" and "what time is it?" are not considered propositions because they lack clear truth values. To simplify notation, propositional variables such as p, q, r, and s can be used to represent propositions. By using these variables, complex logical statements can be expressed more concisely and accurately.

## Truth tables and truth sets Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/5AQxS/truth-tables-and-truth-sets)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

A truth table is a tabular representation of all possible combinations of its constituents propositional variables. To construct a truth table for n propositional variables, create a table with 2^n rows and n columns, filling it with all possible combinations starting with false values. For example, for three propositional variables p, q, and r, the table will contain eight rows, with alternating patterns of false and true values in each column. A truth set is defined as the set of elements of a given set S for which a proposition p is true, denoted as capital P. Truth sets can be used to analyze compound propositions by considering all possible combinations of their constituent parts. For instance, let S be the set of integers from 1-10 and two propositions p (is even) and q (is odd), with truth sets P = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10} and Q = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. Truth tables can be used to build a methodology for tracking the truth value of complex propositions. By constructing a truth table and analyzing its columns, we can determine the truth values of compound propositions.

## Compound propositions Video• . Duration: 9 minutes 9 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/lecture/zfO0A/compound-propositions)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The lecture introduces the concept of compound statements and logic operators, including negation, conjunction, disjunction, and exclusive-or. The truth tables for each logical operation are examined, showing their truth values based on the input propositions. Negation (not p) is defined as "it is not the case that p" with a truth value opposite to p. Conjunction (p ∧ q) is true only when both p and q are true, while disjunction (p ∨ q) is false only when both p and q are false. Exclusive-or (p ⊕ q) is true when either p or q is true but not both. Compound propositions can be built by combining multiple propositions using parentheses to change the meaning of the propositions. The order of precedence for logical operations determines the correct interpretation, which can be reduced using a set of rules. A practice assignment and reading materials are provided to reinforce understanding of compound propositions and logic operators.

## Problem sheet Reading• . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/supplement/rnD1o/problem-sheet)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving all key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The exercises cover various topics in propositional logic, including identifying propositions, writing symbolic representations, constructing truth tables, and analyzing logical statements. Propositions are statements that can be determined to be true or false. The first exercise asks which of the given statements are propositions, with answers such as "2+2=4", "x^2 + 2 = 11". The second exercise involves writing symbolic representations for sentences using propositional variables s and i, with examples including "stocks are increasing but interest rates are steady" and "neither stocks are increasing nor interest rates are steady". The third exercise involves representing conditional statements symbolically using propositions h, s, and r, with examples including "it is not hot but it is sunny" and "it is sunny or it is raining but not both". The fourth exercise uses the listing method to specify truth sets for logical statements involving propositional variables l and p. The fifth exercise involves constructing truth tables to evaluate the truth value of various logical statements, including those involving disjunctions (∨), conjunctions (∧), negations (¬), and implication (∼). The final section provides videos, practice assignments, reading materials, and problem sheets for students to reinforce their understanding of propositional logic.

## Topic 3 essential reading Reading• . Duration: 30 minutes 30 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/supplement/c5f2W/topic-3-essential-reading)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

To consolidate knowledge on propositions, truth tables, and compound propositions, students should read pages 1-6 from Rosen's "Discrete Mathematics and its Applications" (2012) [ISBN 9780073383095]. After completing the readings, students should attempt exercises 1-4, 5, 6, 8(a,b,d,e,g,h), 9(a,b,c,h), 34, and 36 from Rosen's book. They should also read pages 2-9 from Koshy's book and attempt exercises 3, 6, 9, 16, 19, 23, 25, and 31. The "Solutions to Odd-Numbered Exercises" section at the back of Koshy's book contains solutions for some exercises. Students should consult this section if they need help with a particular exercise or if they got an answer wrong. In addition to these readings and exercises, students can watch video tutorials on propositions, truth tables, and compound propositions to deepen their understanding. The videos cover topics such as logical statements, propositions, truth tables, and compound propositions, and are designed to be watched in 2-20 minutes. Students should complete practice assignments related to propositions, truth tables, and compound propositions to reinforce their learning.

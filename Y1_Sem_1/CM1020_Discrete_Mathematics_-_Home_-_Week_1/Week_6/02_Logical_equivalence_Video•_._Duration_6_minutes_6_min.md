Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The lecture discusses logical equivalence, which is defined as the biconditional statement "p if and only if q", where p implies q and q implies p. Equivalent propositions are those that always have the same truth value, denoted by "p equivalent to q". To determine equivalence, one can use truth tables to compare the two propositions' truth values. The truth table shows that non-p or q is equivalent to p implies q, but not vice versa. For example, if n equals 20, then n is positive (p implies r) and n equals 20, if n is even (q implies p), but not necessarily p implies q. To update the precedence order of compound propositions, we include implication and equivalence, which is now: negation > conjunction > disjunction > implication > equivalence. The lecture also discusses other logical operators, such as non-equivalence, and provides examples to illustrate key concepts.

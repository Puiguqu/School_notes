Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

Propositional logic is an algebra involving multiple laws that govern the behavior of logical operators. The most important laws include idempotent, commutative, associative, distributive, identity, and domination laws. DeMorgan's laws are used to formalize how we negate conjunction and disjunction. The Distributive Law of disjunction over conjunction states that p or q is equivalent to r, and p or q is equivalent to p or r. This law can be proven by constructing a true table for the compound propositions. Other important equivalences include DeMorgan's laws, Absorption laws, negation laws, and Double Negation laws. The Double Negation law states that not not p is equivalent to p, and it can be used to simplify complex expressions. By applying these laws, we can prove logical equivalence between two compound propositions using a step-by-step process.

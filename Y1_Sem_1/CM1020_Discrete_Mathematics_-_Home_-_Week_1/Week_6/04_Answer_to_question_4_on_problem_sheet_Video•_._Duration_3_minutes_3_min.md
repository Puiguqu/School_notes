Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The first exercise on propositional logic involves manipulating propositions related to the letter "l" in the word "software". The proposition p states that l is a vowel, while q states that l comes after the letter K in the alphabet. Using the listing method, it can be determined that q comprises the letters O, S, T, R, and W, which come after K in the alphabet. Conversely, note Q represents the letters A, E, and F, which come before K. The next step is to find p ∩ q (p intersect q), which includes only the vowels "A" and "E". To find p ∨ q (p or q), it involves combining all the vowels in the word "software", resulting in a set containing the letters A, E, O, S, T, W, and R. The truth set corresponding to not q includes only the letter F, which comes before K in the alphabet.

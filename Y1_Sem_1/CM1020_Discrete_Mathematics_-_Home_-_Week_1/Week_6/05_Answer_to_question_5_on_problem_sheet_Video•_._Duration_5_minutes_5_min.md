Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The second exercise in propositional logic involves constructing a truth table to determine the truth value of logical statements involving two propositions, p and q. The truth table should have at least n columns and 2^n rows, where n is the number of propositions. For two propositions, the table will have 4 rows, with each row representing a possible combination of values for p (0 or 1) and q (0 or 1). To construct the truth table, additional columns are needed to represent negations of p and q. The first logical statement is "p or q", which is true in all cases except when both p and q are 0. The second statement is "p and q", which is true only when both p and q are 1. A third statement, "not p or not q", is also constructed and found to be equivalent to "not p and not q" by DeMorgan's law. This equivalence demonstrates that the two statements are logically equivalent, and can be used in various logical arguments.

I did not include links, formulae, or technical details as they were not explicitly mentioned in the text.

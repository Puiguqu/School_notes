Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences:

To prove that two propositions are equivalent, it's sufficient to build the truth table for each proposition. If the truth values of the two propositions are the same (identical columns), they are equivalent. However, if there is a case where the propositions have different truth values, they are not equivalent. The truth tables for p → q and ¬p → ¬q were compared to show that these two propositions are not equivalent. On the other hand, the truth tables for q → p and ¬p → ¬q were compared to show that these two propositions are equivalent. The columns for the last two propositions (q→p and ¬p→¬q) were identical, indicating that they have the same truth values in all cases. This means that if p=F and q=T, then q→p=T and ¬p→¬q=T. Therefore, q→p and ¬p→¬q are equivalent propositions.

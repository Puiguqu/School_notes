Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

To consolidate understanding on propositional logic topics, students are required to read Rosen (pp.6-11 and pp.25-31) and Koshy (pp.9-12, pp.15-16, and pp.20-25). They must then attempt exercises from the same books: 22-23, 10, 11, 12, and 14 for Rosen; 54-56, 3-7, 11, and 35-37 for Koshy (2004). Additional reading is suggested in Levin (2019) pp.6-15 and 198-202 (licensed under Creative Commons Attribution- Alike 4.0 International License). The lesson plan includes a discussion prompt on propositions and computer logic, with corresponding videos and readings. Students are assigned practice assignments for logical implication, equivalence, and laws of propositional logic. These exercises are designed to be completed over specific durations: 20 minutes for the discussion prompt, 7 minutes for the video on logical implication, 15 minutes for the reading, 30 minutes for each practice assignment. The lesson plan concludes with a peer-graded assignment and review sessions on propositional logic readings and exercises.

I can help with that. However, I notice that there are multiple problems listed, and I'll assume you want me to solve the first problem: "Construct the truth table for (p∧q)∨¬r." Here's my solution:

## Step 1: Define the variables
Let p, q, and r be the propositional variables representing 'It rains', 'The ground is wet', and 'It is raining', respectively.

## Step 2: Construct the truth table
We will construct a truth table with all possible combinations of truth values for p, q, and r.

| p | q | r | (p∧q) | ¬r | (p∧q)∨¬r |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T | T | T | T | F | T |
| T | T | F | T | T | T |
| T | F | T | F | F | F |
| T | F | F | F | T | T |
| F | T | T | F | F | F |
| F | T | F | F | T | T |
| F | F | T | F | F | F |
| F | F | F | F | T | T |

## Step 3: Analyze the truth table
The final column, (p∧q)∨¬r, represents the propositional expression "(p∧q)∨¬r". We can see that this expression is true whenever either p and q are both true or r is false.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$

# Propositional logic problem sheet Readingâ€¢ . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-discrete-mathematics/supplement/vLPfe/propositional-logic-problem-sheet)

There is no text provided for me to summarize. The original text appears to be a course outline or schedule, listing reading materials, video lessons, and a summative assessment for a lesson on propositional logic. It does not contain any specific information, formulae, links, or technical details that require summarization. If you provide the actual text, I would be happy to assist with summarizing it in 4 sentences, preserving key information and concepts.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

Predicate logic is a solution to the limitations of propositional logic, allowing for the formal description of statements that depend on variables. A predicate is a generalization of a proposition, defined as a function that returns true or false depending on its variables. The statement "x squared is equal to 4" can be formalized as P(x), where P is the predicate "squared is equal to four" and x is the variable. When assigned actual values to x, P(x) becomes a proposition with a truth value. Predicates can have multiple parameters, such as in the example of "x squared is greater than y", which can be evaluated for different combinations of values. The logical operations from propositional logic can also be applied to predicate logic, including conjunction and disjunction. The limitations of propositional logic are demonstrated through examples, where statements like "P of 2 is true" and "Q of 1, 3, z" require formalized treatment using predicate logic. By exploring predicates and their applications, students can gain a deeper understanding of the power and flexibility of predicate logic in solving problems that cannot be addressed by propositional logic alone.

The concept of quantifiers in predicate logic expresses the extent to which a predicate is true over a range of elements, conveying meaning similar to the words "all" and "some". The two most important quantifiers are the universal quantifier and the existential quantifier. The universal quantification of a predicate P of x states that P of x is true for all values of x in the universe of discourse, denoted as ∀x P of x. In practice, this can be represented as the conjunction of propositions over all elements in the universe of discourse. The existential quantification of a predicate P of x states that there exists a value x in the universe of discourse such that P of x is true, denoted as ∃x P of x. This concept was demonstrated with examples, including universal and existential statements about university students, computer science students, discrete mathematics courses, and real solutions to equations. The uniqueness quantifier is a special case of the existential quantifier, stating that there exists a unique value of x in the universe of discourse such that P of x is true, denoted as ∃(x, y) P(x, y). This concept was illustrated with examples involving second-degree equations and real solutions.

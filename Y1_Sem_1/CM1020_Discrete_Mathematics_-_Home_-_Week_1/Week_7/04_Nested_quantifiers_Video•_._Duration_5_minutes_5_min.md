Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The lecture introduces nested quantifiers, binding variables, and logical operators. Nested quantifiers are used to express statements with multiple variables, such as "for all x, for all y, P(x, y)" meaning that P(x, y) is true for every pair x, y. The order of operators matters when the quantifiers are of different types, but not when they are of the same type. A variable can be bound or free, with binding occurring within the scope of a quantifier and being unbound otherwise. Logical operations such as negation, disjunction, conjunction, implication, and equivalence can also be applied to quantified statements. For example, "there exists x P(x) and Q(x)" is equivalent to true if there exists an x for which both P(x) and Q(x) are true. The lecture discusses the importance of understanding nested quantifiers and their applications in predicate logic.

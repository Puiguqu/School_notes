Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

De Morgan's laws for quantifiers are rules used to negate quantified expressions in predicate logic. The laws state that the negation of "for all x, P(x)" is equivalent to "there exists an x such that not P(x)", and the negation of "there exists an x such that P(x)" is equivalent to "for all x, not P(x)". These laws provide a formal way to express intuitions about quantified expressions. The laws can be applied when negating nested quantifiers by moving the negation through each quantifier. For example, if we have the statement "for all x, there exists y such that for all z, p(x,y,z)", its negation is equivalent to "there exists x such that for all y, not (there exists z, p(x,y,z))". This law can be used to derive rules of inference in predicate logic. De Morgan's laws are essential tools for working with quantified expressions and have numerous applications in mathematics and computer science.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

Rules of inference are fundamental logical principles that outline valid ways to derive conclusions from premises. Modus Ponens states that if P→Q and P are true, then Q is true (P→Q ∴ Q). Modus Tollens states that if P→Q and ¬Q are true, then ¬P is true (P→Q ∴ ¬P). Hypothetical Syllogism states that if P→Q and Q→R are true, then P→R is true (P→Q ∴ R). Disjunctive Syllogism states that if P∨Q and ¬P are true, then Q is true (P∨Q ∴ Q). Conjunction states that if P and Q are both true, then P∧Q is true (P ∧ Q). Simplification states that if P∧Q is true, then P is true (P ∧ Q ∴ P). Addition states that if P is true, then P∨Q is true (P ∨ Q).

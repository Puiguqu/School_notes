Here is a rewritten version of the text in a more readable format:

**Midterm Preparation**

The midterm assessment covers five topics: Functions, Propositional Logic, Predicate Logic, and Boolean Algebra. The assessment requires you to understand the concepts, properties, and operations of each topic.

**Functions**

* Domain, co-domain, and range of a function
* Properties of functions (one-to-one, onto, bijective)
* Inverse functions if one exists

**Propositional Logic**

* Definition of a proposition
* Compound propositions using OR, AND, NOT
* Symmetric difference, implication, and equivalence of propositions
* Truth tables and truth sets for compound propositions
* Laws of propositional logic (idempotent, commutative, associative, distributive, etc.)
* De Morgan's laws

**Predicate Logic**

* Difference between a predicate and a proposition
* Quantifiers: universal, existential, and uniqueness quantifier
* Nested quantifiers
* Rules of inference (Modus ponens, Modus tollens, conjunctions, disjunctive syllogism, etc.)
* Combining rules of inference for propositions and quantified statements

**Boolean Algebra**

* Laws of Boolean algebra (distributive, associative, commutative, etc.)
* Building blocks: logic gates
* Converting Boolean expressions to logical circuits and vice versa
* Karnaugh map for simplifying Boolean expressions

**Additional Resources**

* Video: "Video Midterm preparation" (14 minutes)
* Video: "Introduction to Boolean algebra" (5 minutes)
* Discussion Prompt: "What do you know about Boolean algebra?" (20 minutes)
* Reading: "Postulates of Boolean algebra" (15 minutes)
* Practice Assignment: "Postulates of Boolean algebra" (25 minutes)

**Practice Assignments**

* Functions: "Boolean functions" (30 minutes)
* Propositional Logic: essential reading topic 5 (2 hours)

Note: I removed the extraneous text and reformatted the content to make it more readable. Let me know if you'd like me to add anything else!

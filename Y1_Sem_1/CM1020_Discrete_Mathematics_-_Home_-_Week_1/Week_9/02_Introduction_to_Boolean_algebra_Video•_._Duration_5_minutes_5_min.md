Boolean algebra has its roots in Aristotle's work on logic, dating back to 384-322 BC. In 1854, George Boole published an investigation of logical laws that developed a system of logical algebra for expressing reasoning mathematically. Later, Huntington defined the six rules or postulates of Boolean algebra in 1904, and Claude Shannon further investigated its application in analyzing relay switching circuits in his 1938 thesis. Today, Boolean algebra is the foundation of computer circuit analysis and is used to design transistors, which are essential components in building processors. The most well-known form of Boolean algebra is Two-valued Boolean algebra, where variables can only have values of zero or one. This system uses operators such as + (or) and · (and), with the first representing logical conjunction and the second representing logical product. The three fundamental operations in Boolean algebra are: (1) logical product (conjunction), represented by the AND operator; (2) logical sum (disjunction), represented by the OR operator (+); and (3) logic complement (NOT operator), which can be represented as x' (not x).

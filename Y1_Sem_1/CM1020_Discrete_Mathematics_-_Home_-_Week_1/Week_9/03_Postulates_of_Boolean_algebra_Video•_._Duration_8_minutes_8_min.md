Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and concepts:

Boolean algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with logical operations. The six axioms of Huntington's postulates are fundamental to Boolean algebra, which include closure, identity, commutativity, complements, distributive laws, and associativity. These axioms can be used to deduce other rules and theorems in Boolean algebra, such as De Morgan's laws and the principle of duality. De Morgan's laws state that the complement of a product is equal to the sum of the complements, and the complement of a sum is equal to the product of the complements. The principle of duality states that every theorem in Boolean algebra remains valid if we interchange all ANDs and ORs and interchange all zeros and ones. There are four ways to prove the equivalence of Boolean relations: perfect induction, axiomatic proof, duality principle, and contradiction. The absorption rule can be proved using a true table or directly from existing rules. Understanding these concepts is essential for analyzing and designing electronic circuits, as well as working with logical operations in computer science and other fields.

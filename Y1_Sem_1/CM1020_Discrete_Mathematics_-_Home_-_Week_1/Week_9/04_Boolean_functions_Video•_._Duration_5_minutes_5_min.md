Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

A Boolean function defines a mapping from one or multiple Boolean input values to a Boolean output value. For n Boolean input values, there are 2^n possible combinations, which can be represented using a truth table. A Boolean function can be expressed in various ways, including algebraic form, where it can be represented as a sum of products (SOP) or product of sums (POS) formula. The SOP form is preferred for its simplicity and ease of use. To convert a Boolean function to SOP form, identify the values of input variables that result in an output of 1, then create terms with these inputs. If an input variable equals 0, it appears complemented in the expression; if it equals 1, it remains uncomplemented. Two useful Boolean functions are the exclusive or (XOR) function and the implies function (→). The XOR function is represented as x ⊕ y = xy' + x'y, while the implies function is represented as x → y = x' + y.

### Introduction to discrete mathematics Video• . Duration: 4 minutes 4 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

Discrete mathematics is a branch of mathematics that deals with discrete or distinct objects rather than continuous objects, focusing on structures and algorithms used to represent and manipulate these objects. Discrete objects are separated or distinct from each other, such as integers or rational numbers. This field has numerous applications in computer science and other fields, including programming languages, software development, cryptography, and algorithms. Graph theory is a key area of study, used to model and analyze networks like social networks, transportation networks, and communication networks. Boolean algebra studies logical operations and their application in computer circuits, while data structures are used to store and manipulate data efficiently. This module will introduce fundamental concepts such as sets, functions, relations, graphs, trees, logics, combinatorics, mathematical proofs, and recursive relations over 10 topics spanning 20 weeks. The assessment for this module consists of three elements: 10 summative quizzes (20% of final grade), a midterm assignment (30% of final grade), and a final exam (50% of final grade). By studying this module, students will gain a mathematical understanding of these topics, improving their skills in thinking abstractly and supporting their studies in computer science.

### Careers video Video• . Duration: 3 minutes 3 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The speaker, Liz Wilkinson, a Careers Consultant at the University of London, will be discussing career development and its various phases. She notes that career development can mean different things to different people, such as climbing the ladder or specializing within a sector. The speaker highlights her own 35-year career journey, which included multiple career development phases, and emphasizes the importance of understanding one's current phase and qualities. Liz Wilkinson references Edwin's point about feeling uncertain about learning new skills and suggests starting with self-reflection exercises to address these concerns. She draws on research by Liedtka, who identified three key elements of strategic thinking: taking a system's perspective, focusing on intent, and keeping the vision in front of oneself. These principles can be applied to career development by looking at the big picture, analyzing job advertisements, and considering factors such as market trends, personal goals, and desired lifestyle. The speaker encourages individuals to think about what they want to achieve in their careers and how they can respond intelligently to changes in the labor market or other external circumstances. By adopting a strategic thinking approach to career development, individuals can make informed decisions and create a fulfilling career path that aligns with their values and goals.

### The definition of a set Video• . Duration: 8 minutes 8 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

Set theory is a branch of mathematics that deals with properties of well-defined collections of objects. A set is defined as an unordered collection of unique objects, with no duplicates allowed. The cardinality of a set refers to the number of elements in the set, denoted by |S| and equal to S. For example, the set E = {2, 4, 6, 8} has a cardinality of 4, while the set V = {a, e, i, o, u} has a cardinality of 5. The empty set contains no elements and has a cardinality of 0. A set A is a subset of set B if every element of A is also an element of B, denoted by A ⊆ B. The special sets N (natural numbers), Z (integers), Q (rational numbers), and R (real numbers) are subsets of each other: N ⊆ Z, Z ⊆ Q, Q ⊆ R.

Note that I have preserved the key concepts, definitions, and formulas mentioned in the original text, but condensed the information into 8 sentences.

### The listing method and rule of inclusion Video• . Duration: 8 minutes 8 min

The video transcript discusses the representation of sets using two methods: listing method and set-builder notation. The listing method involves listing all elements of a set, while the set-builder notation involves describing the elements in terms of a rule or formula. 

Two examples are presented for the listing method: S1 is the set of all vowels in the English alphabet, and S2 is the set of positive integers less than 10. A third example, S3, is the set of even positive integers less than 10. The transcript shows that these sets can be represented using the set-builder notation.

For instance, the set of all even integers is represented as the set of elements of two times n, such that n is an element of Z. Similarly, the set of odd integers is represented as the set of elements of the form two times n plus one. 

The transcript also discusses the representation of the set of rational numbers Q. The listing method cannot accurately represent this set, but using the set-builder notation, it can be written as the set of elements of the form n over m, such that n and m are elements of Z and m is different from zero.

The exercise includes examples where sets S1, S2, and S3 are represented using the listing method and then rewritten using set-builder notation. The examples illustrate how to represent these sets in terms of formulas or rules using the set-builder notation.

For instance, the set S1, which contains three times n, such that n is a natural number strictly less than six, can be represented as a set of elements of the form one over 2n, where n is an integer and zero not included. Similarly, sets S2 and S3 are represented using the set-builder notation.

The transcript also provides additional information on other topics in set theory, such as introducing the definition of a set, explaining the listing method and rule of inclusion, discussing powersets, and covering basic set operations.

Overall, the video transcript is an introduction to set theory, providing examples and explanations for key concepts in set representation using both listing method and set-builder notation.

### The powerset of a set Video• . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving all key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The power set of a set S, denoted as P(S), is the set whose elements are all the subsets of S. Given a set S containing three elements (1, 2, and 3), the power set P(S) consists of all possible subsets of S, including the empty set, sets with one element, sets with two elements, and the set itself. The cardinality of a power set is equal to 2 raised to the power of the cardinality of the original set. For example, if S has three elements (1, 2, and 3), P(S) has 8 subsets: {∅}, {a}, {b}, {c}, {ab}, {ac}, {bc}, and {abc}. The empty set is a subset of any set, so it is also an element of the power set. By definition, the cardinality of a power set of a set S is equal to 2^n, where n is the cardinality of S. This means that if we take a set with two elements and find its power set, the resulting set will have twice as many subsets as the original set.

### Set operations Video• . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving all key information:

The lesson covers basic set operations, including union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference. The union of two sets A and B contains all elements that are in either A or B, while the intersection contains only the elements common to both sets. The set difference (A - B) contains elements in A but not in B, using the notation x ∈ A - B if and only if x ∈ A and x ∉ B. The symmetric difference (A Δ B) contains elements in A or B but not in both, which can be calculated as (A - B) U (B - A). Membership tables show all combinations of sets that an element belongs to, with 0 indicating absence and 1 indicating presence. To find the union of two sets, combine all unique elements from both sets, while for intersection, keep only shared elements. The formulae for these operations are: A ∪ B = {x | x ∈ A or x ∈ B}, A ∩ B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∈ B}, A - B = {x | x ∈ A and x ∉ B}, and A Δ B = (A - B) U (B - A).

### The definition of a set Reading• . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

## Step 1: Review the problem
The problem is a series of questions related to set theory, specifically about elements, special sets of numbers, empty sets, cardinality, and finite vs infinite sets.

## Step 2: Identify the key concepts
The key concepts include understanding what an element (member) of a set is denoted by ∈ \in , how to denote special sets like natural numbers, integers, rational numbers, and real numbers, and recognizing the difference between finite and infinite sets.

## Step 3: Address each question or concept directly if possible
Since there's no direct numerical problem to solve but rather a series of conceptual questions about set theory, we must acknowledge that this format doesn't directly apply. However, for educational purposes, let's clarify the main points:

- An element of a set is denoted by ∈ \in .
- The empty set ∅ represents a set with no elements.
- Cardinality (∣A∣) refers to the number of distinct elements in a set A.
- Finite sets have a limited number of elements, while infinite sets have an unlimited number of elements.

## Step 4: Conclude based on the nature of the problem
Given that there's no numerical solution to find but rather explanations needed for understanding concepts, we cannot provide a final numerical answer. The task was to review and possibly explain set theory basics.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$

## Week 10

### Logic gates Video• . Duration: 6 minutes 6 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

Logic gates are electronic circuits with one or more inputs that produce an output based on logical functions of the inputs. The three most basic logic circuits are OR gates, AND gates, and invertor (NOT) gates, which can be combined to perform more complex operations. Each gate has a truth table that defines its behavior based on input values. For example, an AND gate produces a HIGH output only when all inputs are HIGH, while an OR gate produces a HIGH output if at least one input is HIGH. The XOR, NAND, NOR, and XNOR gates are examples of logic gates that can be constructed from the basic gates. These gates have specific truth tables and behavior patterns. De Morgan's laws can be represented using logic gates, which state that the complement of a product equals the sum of the complements, and vice versa. Logic gates can also be used to represent more complex operations, such as simplification of circuits, which is discussed in further readings and practice assignments.

---

### Combinational circuits Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

Combination circuits are logic networks that implement Boolean functions by modeling all possible states of the function. To build a combination circuit from a Boolean function, one must label gate outputs that depend on input variables and express the Boolean functions for each level of gates until all outputs are written as Boolean expressions. Combinational circuits can be used to design systems for solving specific problems like addition or multiplication by modeling the problem as a Boolean expression and replacing operations with equivalent logic gates. A half adder is a simple combinational circuit that adds two binary bits, represented by a truth table showing the output depends on X OR Y. To overcome limitations, a full adder can be designed with three inputs to include carry bits, and its corresponding Boolean expressions are x' or y' or carry in and xy + carry in. A box diagram is often used as a simple abstraction presenting only inputs and outputs of a circuit. Combinational circuits can be simplified by reducing the number of gates used while preserving their functionality. By understanding combination circuits and their applications, students can learn to design systems for solving specific problems using Boolean functions and logic gates.

Note that I have preserved key information, formulae, links, and technical details, but condensed the text to focus on the most important concepts and findings.

### Simplification of circuits Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and concepts:

Boolean algebra can be used to represent and simplify Boolean functions using rules such as De Morgan's laws, distributive laws, commutative, idempotent, and complement laws, and the absorption law. These rules allow for simplification of Boolean expressions by reducing the number of gates and depth in a circuit. Algebraic simplification is beneficial in circuit design as it reduces global cost, computation time, and allows more circuits to be fitted on the same chip. The Karnaugh map (K-map) is a graphical representation of Boolean functions that can be used for expressions with 2, 3, 4, or 5 variables. A K-map is an array of cells where adjacent cells differ by only one variable and represents the true table. Simplification using K-maps involves identifying 1's in a table, grouping them into rectangles of power of 2 length, writing terms for these rectangles, and minimizing the expression. The Karnaugh map simplifies Boolean functions by reducing the number of gates and depth in a circuit, similar to algebraic simplification. By applying these techniques, designers can create more efficient circuits that meet specific requirements.

Note: I did not include any links or technical details as they are not essential to understanding the main concepts and findings of the text.

### Simplification of circuits Reading• . Duration: 15 minutes 15 min

## Step 1: Understand the problem
The problem asks us to simplify a given Boolean expression using Boolean algebra and postulates. The Boolean expression is F(A,B,C) = A.B + A.(B+C) + B.(B+C).

## Step 2: Apply the distributive law
We can start by applying the distributive law to expand the terms in the expression.

F(A,B,C) = A.B + A.B + A.C + B.B + B.C

## Step 3: Simplify using idempotent law
Using the idempotent law, we can simplify the repeated term B.B to just B.

F(A,B,C) = A.B + A.C + B + B.C

## Step 4: Apply absorption law
We can now apply the absorption law to simplify further. The absorption law states that B + BC = B.

F(A,B,C) = A.B + A.C + B

## Step 5: Simplify using idempotent law again
Using the idempotent law again, we can combine the terms B and B.C into just B.

F(A,B,C) = A.B + A.C + B

The final answer is: $\boxed{A.B + A.C + B}$

## Week 11

### Introduction to proofs Video• . Duration: 8 minutes 8 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving all key information and technical details:

A proof is a valid argument used to prove the truth of a statement, which can be built using variables, predicates, quantifiers, laws of logic, and rules of inference. A theorem is a formal statement that can be shown to be true, while an axiom is a statement assumed to be true as a premise for further arguments. A lemma is a proven statement used as a step to a larger result, and a corollary is a theorem established by a short proof from another theorem. There are three types of proofs: direct proof, proof by contrapositive, and proof by contradiction. Direct proof involves showing that a conditional statement p implies q is true by assuming p is true and using axioms, definitions, and theorems with rules of inference to show that q must be true. Proof by contrapositive involves proving the contrapositive of a statement, not q implies not p, which is equivalent to proving p implies q. Proof by contradiction involves assuming the statement to be proven is false and showing that this assumption leads to a false proposition, concluding that it was wrong to assume the statement is false and thus must be true. The three types of proofs can be used in conjunction with the principle of mathematical induction to prove statements about infinite sets.

### The principle of mathematical induction Video• . Duration: 3 minutes 3 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

Mathematical induction is a principle used to assert that a propositional function P(n) is true for all positive integers n. The formal definition involves two steps: a base case where P(1) is shown to be true, and an inductive step where it is demonstrated that if P(k) is true for any k, then P(k+1) is also true. This process allows for the conclusion that P(n) is true for all n by induction. The principle can be applied to prove various statements such as formulas, inequalities, divisibility, and properties of subsets and their cardinality. Mathematical induction relies on the idea that if a property holds for one number (n=1), it will also hold for subsequent numbers through an iterative process. This concept is intuitive, where P(1) being true leads to P(2), which in turn leads to P(3), and so forth. The structure of mathematical induction involves verifying two steps: establishing the base case and demonstrating the inductive step. By using this principle, one can prove that a statement holds for all positive integers n.

### Proof by induction Video• . Duration: 7 minutes 7 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

Mathematical induction is a method used to prove formulas, inequalities, and divisibility for all positive integers. To prove a propositional function P(n), two steps must be verified: the basis step (P(1) is true) and the inductive step (if P(k) is true, then P(k+1) is true). The basis step involves showing that P(n) is true for the smallest positive integer n, which is typically n=1. The inductive step involves assuming P(k) is true and using it to show P(k+1) is true. Mathematical induction can be used to prove statements such as the sum from 1 to n being equal to n*(n+1)/2 for all n ≥ 1, and that 3^n < n! for all n ≥ 7. The method can also be used to prove divisibility statements, such as 6^n + 4 being divisible by 5 for all n ≥ 0. However, incorrect inductions can occur if the base case is not verified or false assumptions are made during the inductive step. To avoid this, it is essential to thoroughly verify both the base case and the inductive step in order to prove a statement true for all positive integers.

### Strong induction Video• . Duration: 7 minutes 7 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and concepts:

Strong induction is a form of mathematical induction that can be used to prove statements about natural numbers. The formal expression of strong induction states that if P(k) is true for all k from 1 to n, then P(n+1) is also true. This form of induction can be equivalently used with the well-ordering property and mathematical induction. The well-ordering property states that every non-empty set of positive integers has a smallest element. To prove a statement using strong induction, one needs to verify two steps: the basis step, which shows P(2) is true, and the inductive step, which assumes P(k) for all k less than n+1 and proves P(n+1). The well-ordering property can also be used to prove statements about natural numbers. In this lesson, strong induction was introduced as an alternative form of mathematical induction, along with its equivalence to the well-ordering property and mathematical induction.

### Recursive definitions Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

Recursive definitions are mathematical objects defined in terms of themselves, allowing for easier definition than explicit ones. A recursively defined function f with domain n has two steps: basis step specifying an initial value and recursive step providing a rule to find the value at any integer from smaller integers. The sequence aN can be defined as 4n, 4^n, or just 4 in different cases, where each term is greater than the previous by 4. Sets can also be defined recursively with basis step specifying initial elements and recursive step providing a rule for constructing new elements. An algorithm is a finite sequence of precise instructions for performing computation or solving a problem, and it's called recursive if it solves a problem by reducing it to an instance of the same problem with smaller inputs. The pseudo code for the recursive algorithm for computing n factorial is: zero factorial equals 1, and n factorial equals n multiplied by (n-1) factorial for positive integers n. Recursion can be applied to functions, sets, and algorithms, and each case has its own definition and examples. The lecture concludes with additional resources and a summary of the topic.

### Recurrence relations Video• . Duration: 9 minutes 9 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulas, links, and technical details:

Recurrence relations are equations that define a sequence based on a rule that gives the next term as a function of the previous term. The game of Hanoi Tower involves transferring n discs from one spoke to another without placing a larger disc on top of a smaller one, with the minimum number of moves required being 2^n - 1. Linear recurrence relations can be formalized as an = C1 an-1 + c2 an-2 + ... + ck an-k, where k is the degree of the relation. Non-homogeneous recurrence relations can be formalized as an = C1 an-1 + c2 an-2 + ... + ck an-k + f(n), where f(n) is a function depending only on n. The Fibonacci sequence is an example of a second-order linear recurrence, where each number is found by adding up to two numbers before it (an = an-1 + an-2). Arithmetic sequences have a constant difference between consecutive terms (an+1 = an + c), while geometric sequences have a constant ratio between consecutive terms (an+1 = rn). Divide and conquer algorithms consist of three steps: dividing the problem into smaller subproblems, solving recursively each subproblem, and combining solutions to find a solution to the original problem. The lecture discussed recurrence relations, linear sequences, arithmetic and geometric sequences, and introduce divide and conquer relations.

Note that I did not include any links or formulas as they were not provided in the text, but rather summarized the key concepts and findings.

### Solving recurrence relations Video• . Duration: 8 minutes 8 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The lesson focuses on solving recurrence relations using strong induction, linear homogeneous recurrences, and Fibonacci recurrences. To solve linear homogeneous recurrences, one needs to find a combination of geometric sequences that satisfy the characteristic equation. The characteristic equation is obtained by dividing both sides of the recurrence relation by the highest power of r. Solving the characteristic equation yields roots whose multiplicity determines the form of the solution. For example, in the Fibonacci recurrence relation, the characteristic equation has two distinct roots with multiplicity 1. The general solution to this type of recurrence relation is a linear combination of these roots raised to the power of n. In the case of the Fibonacci sequence, the initial conditions f_0 = 0 and f_1 = 1 are used to find the coefficients of the linear combination, which yield the formula f_n = (1/√5)(r1^n - r2^n).

This transcript appears to be a lecture or tutorial on mathematics, specifically on the topic of proof and induction. The speaker discusses various methods for proving mathematical statements, including direct proof, proof by contraposition, proof by contradiction, and proof by induction.

The main topics covered in this lecture are:

1. Direct Proof: The speaker explains that a direct proof is when you start with what you want to prove (p) and show that it's true.
2. Proof by Contraposition: The speaker discusses how to prove "not q implies not p" which is equivalent to proving "p implies q".
3. Proof by Contradiction: The speaker explains how to prove a statement by assuming its opposite (not p) and showing that this leads to a contradiction.
4. Induction: The speaker goes through examples of induction, including direct proof, proof by contraposition, and proof by contradiction.

The lecture also touches on the concept of strong induction, which is used when you need to assume all previous terms in order to prove the current term.

Some key points mentioned in this lecture include:

* A prime number is divisible only by 1 and itself.
* The definition of a prime number.
* Direct proof: start with what you want to prove and show that it's true.
* Proof by contraposition: equivalent to proving "p implies q".
* Proof by contradiction: assume not p and show that this leads to a contradiction.

### Recursive definitions Reading• . Duration: 15 minutes 15 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving all key information:

Recursive definitions are used to define sequences and sets in discrete mathematics. The base case defines the simplest instance of the object being defined, providing the initial value. Recursive steps define how new elements can be derived from existing ones. Recursively defined functions specify an initial value (base case) and a rule for computing its value from previous values (recursive step). This process is called recursion, not syllogism. Defining a recursive function f(n) from the set N to the set R is equivalent to defining a sequence. Recursive definitions are used to simplify and solve complex mathematical problems, particularly in computer science and mathematics. Understanding these principles provides a foundational understanding of recursion in defining sequences and sets, which is crucial for both theoretical and practical applications.

### Topic 7 introduction Video• . Duration: 3 minutes 3 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

Graph theory is an area of discrete mathematics that studies configurations called graphs, consisting of vertices (nodes) and edges connecting them. The first problem in graph theory was the Seven Bridges of Konigsberg problem, solved by Leonhard Euler in 1735, which involved determining whether it was possible to take a walk and cross all seven bridges only once between two islands. Graphs can be used to model real-world problems, such as computer networks, roadmaps, shortest path problems, and assigning jobs to employees. In graph theory, vertices represent dry land and edges represent bridges. The degree sequence of a graph is a measure of the number of edges connected to each vertex. Special graphs include simple graphs (no multiple edges between vertices), r-regular graphs (all vertices have the same degree), and complete graphs (every pair of vertices is connected by an edge). Graph theory can be used to distinguish chemical compound structures, such as modeling molecules using graphs to gain insight into physical properties. The lecture series will continue to explore graph theory in more detail, including walks, paths, circuits, and special types of graphs.

### Definition of a graph Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

A graph is a discrete structure consisting of vertices and edges that connect them. It can be represented by a pair VE, where V is a set of nodes (vertices) and E is a set of edges (lines or connections). Vertices are the basic elements of a graph, usually drawn as nodes or dots, and are denoted by V(G) or just V. An edge is a link between two vertices, represented by a line connecting them, and is denoted by E(G) or just E. Two vertices are adjacent if they share the same vertex, while two edges are adjacent if they connect the same pair of vertices. Loops occur when an edge connects a vertex to itself, while parallel edges occur when multiple edges connect the same pair of vertices. Directed graphs, also known as digraphs, are graphs where edges have a direction, usually indicated by an arrow on the edge. This lecture covered the definition and basic concepts of graphs, including adjacency, loops, and directed graphs.

### Walks and paths in a graph Video• . Duration: 11 minutes 11 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

A walk in a graph is a sequence of vertices and edges where vertices and edges can be repeated. A trail is a walk with no repeated edges, while a circuit is a closed trail with repeated vertices only. A path is a trail with neither repeated vertices nor edges. The length of a path is the number of edges it contains. An Eulerian path is a path that traverses each edge of a graph once, making the graph traversable. A Hamiltonian path visits each vertex of a graph exactly once, while a Hamiltonian cycle visits each vertex except the start and end vertices. A strongly connected directed graph has a directed path between all pairs of vertices, whereas an undirected graph is connected if there exists a path between any two nodes. The transitive closure of a digraph provides reachability information about the graph by adding directed edges from one vertex to another if there is a directed path between them.

### The degree sequence of a graph Video• . Duration: 8 minutes 8 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving all key information:

The degree of a vertex in a graph is defined as the number of edges incident to it, with loops contributing twice to the degree and isolated vertices having a degree of 0. In directed graphs, the out-degree of a vertex is defined as the number of edges that end at the vertex, while the in-degree is the number of edges that start at the vertex. The degree sequence of a graph is a list of the degrees of each vertex in descending order, separated by commas. One property of a graph's degree sequence is that the sum of the degree sequence is always even, as it is impossible to construct a graph with an odd sum of degree sequence. Another property is that the sum of the degree sequence is twice the number of edges in the graph. To verify this, we can use the example of a graph with a degree sequence of 4,3,2,1,1, which has 7 edges. By counting the edges manually, we can confirm that the sum of the degree sequence matches the expected value. This concept is crucial in understanding how graphs can be represented using their degree sequences.

### Walks, paths and circuits in graph theory Reading• . Duration: 15 minutes 15 min

The text is a passage about graph theory, specifically explaining the concepts of walks, paths, and circuits.

To answer the question "What are walks, paths, and circuits in graph theory?", here's a summary:

*   **Walks**: A walk is a sequence of vertices and edges that starts at a vertex, traverses to another vertex (or returns to the starting vertex), and ends at another vertex. In the passage, it provides examples of different types of walks, such as walks with repeated vertices or repeated edges.
*   **Paths**: A path is a walk in which all vertices and edges are distinct. It means that a path does not revisit any vertex. The passage provides an example of a path from vertex a to vertex d.
*   **Circuits**: A circuit is a type of walk that starts and ends at the same vertex, with all edges distinct. The passage provides an example of a circuit starting and ending at vertex a.

Understanding walks, paths, and circuits is essential in various applications, such as network routing and social network analysis.

## Week 14

### Isomorphic graphs Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

Two graphs are considered isomorphic if there exists a bijection (an invertible function) that maps all vertices from one graph to another while preserving adjacency and non-adjacency. This means that if two vertices are adjacent in one graph, they will be adjacent in the other graph under the mapping. Isomorphism can help show that two graphs appear different but are actually structurally similar. For example, consider two graphs G1 and G2, where a mapping from each vertex of G1 to a corresponding vertex in G2 establishes an isomorphism. The definition of isomorphic graphs relies on the existence of such a bijection, which preserves adjacency and non-adjacency. In contrast, two graphs with different degree sequences cannot be isomorphic, as they must have distinct arrangements of edges around vertices. On the other hand, having the same degree sequence does not necessarily imply isomorphism, as there can exist bijections between the vertex sets that preserve adjacency without being a one-to-one correspondence. The concept of isomorphism in graphs has several important properties and applications, including the relationship between degree sequences of isomorphic graphs.

Note: I removed all external links, formulae, and technical details not directly related to summarizing the main concepts and findings of the text.

### Bipartite graphs Video• . Duration: 9 minutes 9 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

A bipartite graph is defined as a graph where the vertices can be divided into two sets, V1 and V2, such that each edge connects one vertex from V1 to one vertex from V2. A matching in a bipartite graph is a set of pairwise non-adjacent edges with no common endpoints. A maximum matching is a matching with the largest possible size, where adding any more edges would violate the matching condition. The Hopcroft-Karp algorithm is used to find a maximum matching in a bipartite graph. The algorithm uses breadth-first search and depth-first search to traverse the graph and find augmenting paths that can be used to increase the size of the matching. An example of how the algorithm works is shown using a job seeker and candidate matching graph, where three candidates are matched with three jobs. The Hopcroft-Karp algorithm produces a maximum cardinality matching where each vertex on each side is connected to exactly one vertex on the other side. The algorithm's pseudocode can be represented as a bipartite graph, and applying it results in a maximum matching where each candidate is matched to a job.

### The adjacency matrix of a graph Video• . Duration: 9 minutes 9 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

A graph can be represented by two different methods: the adjacency list and the adjacency matrix. The adjacency list represents the vertices and their corresponding adjacent vertices, while the adjacency matrix represents the edges between vertices as elements of a matrix. The number of edges in an undirected graph is equal to half the sum of all the elements m_ij of its corresponding adjacency matrix. Additionally, the sum of all the elements of the adjacency matrix is equal to the sum of the degree sequence of the graph. In a directed graph, each edge has a defined direction, and the adjacency matrix represents the edges as pairs of vertices. The number of paths of Length 2 from a vertex can be calculated using the squared adjacency matrix. Finally, the lesson covers properties of the adjacency matrix, including the relationship between the sum of the degree sequence and the adjacency matrix.

### Dijkstra's algorithm Video• . Duration: 8 minutes 8 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving all key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

Dijkstra's algorithm is used to compute the shortest path between two vertices in a weighted graph. A weighted graph is a graph where each edge is assigned a numerical value, which can be used to model distances, response times, or costs in various applications. The algorithm works by iteratively visiting unvisited vertices and updating their shortest distance and previous vertex information. In the first iteration, the algorithm initializes the distance from the start vertex to all other vertices as infinity, except for itself, which is set to zero. In subsequent iterations, the algorithm visits the unvisited vertex with the smallest known distance from the start vertex, updates its neighbors' distances if necessary, and marks it as visited. The algorithm continues until all vertices have been visited, at which point the shortest path can be constructed by tracing back the previous vertices. Dijkstra's algorithm has a time complexity of O(E + V log V) in the worst case, where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices.

### Dijkstra's algorithm simulation Reading• . Duration: 20 minutes 20 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

Dijkstra's algorithm is a graph search algorithm that can be applied to weighted graphs. The algorithm simulates finding the shortest route between two stations in an underground network. Each vertex represents a station, each edge represents a route between two stations, and the distance in kilometres between two stations represents the cost or weight of that route. In the simulation, help text guides the user through each stage of the process, while the current underground network is represented as a weighted graph. The user must select a starting and end point for their journey and click on the graph to find distances between directly connected stations. Once the table row is filled in, it means that all distances from the current station have been found, and the next step is to select the station with the shortest distance. The solution can be visualized on either the graph or the Dijkstra's table, which highlights the shortest route and journey from start to end.

### Topic 8 introduction Video• . Duration: 2 minutes 2 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

Trees are a fundamental data structure in computer science, inspired by their composition in nature. In computer science, trees are represented upside down and have various applications, including organization charts, file systems, and version control systems. Trees can be used to find shortest paths in graphs, locate items in lists, and model procedures with decision sequences. A binary tree is a fundamental data structure in high-level programming, which will be further explored in the next lecture. Trees are employed in a wide range of algorithms, including those for games like checker and chess. They can help determine winning strategies by modeling game trees. The properties of trees will be examined to solve real-world problems, building on the informal definition provided earlier.

### Definition of a tree Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

A graph is considered acyclic if it has no cycles, including loops and parallel edges. A tree is defined as an undirected graph that is connected and cycle-free. There exists a unique simple path between any two vertices in a tree, which can be proven by contradiction. The number of edges in a tree with n vertices is exactly n-1. The concept of a rooted tree is introduced, where one vertex is designated as the root and every edge is directed away from it. The definition of trees and roots are formalized through examples and properties. A forest is defined as a cycle-free disconnected graph, which can be distinguished from a tree by its lack of connectivity. Understanding these concepts is essential for tracing graph theory, including acyclic graphs, trees, rooted trees, and spanning/minimum spanning trees.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and concepts:

A spanning tree of a graph G is a connected cycle-free subgraph of G that contains all the vertices of G. To construct a spanning tree, one keeps all the vertices of G and breaks all cycles while keeping the graph connected. The number of possible spanning trees of a graph depends on its structure, with graphs having more edges allowing for more spanning trees. For example, graph G1 has four possible spanning trees, graph G2 has eight, and graph G3 has 16. Two spanning trees are isomorphic if there exists a bijection preserving adjacency between the two trees, meaning they represent the same structure but may be drawn differently. When drawing all spanning trees of a graph, it's only necessary to draw non-isomorphic ones to avoid repetition. The definition of a tree in graph theory includes a connected subgraph with no cycles, and understanding spanning trees is crucial in various applications such as Internet multicasting.

### Minimum spanning tree Video• . Duration: 7 minutes 7 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

Minimum cost spanning trees are useful in situations where a network needs to be connected with minimal cost. The weight or cost of a spanning tree is defined as the sum of the costs of its edges. Two basic algorithms for finding minimum cost spanning trees are Kruskal's algorithm and Prim's algorithm. Kruskal's algorithm starts by selecting the cheapest edge in the graph that does not form a cycle, adding it to the tree, and repeating this process until all vertices are connected. The algorithm ensures the minimum cost spanning tree has the lowest total weight or cost. In contrast, Prim's algorithm begins with an arbitrary node, selects the cheapest edge incident on it, and then adds the cheapest edge leading to nodes not yet in the tree, repeating this process until all vertices are connected. Both algorithms can be used to find a minimum cost spanning tree, with Kruskal's being more suitable for large graphs and Prim's for smaller ones due to its simplicity. The goal of both algorithms is to create a minimum cost spanning tree that connects all nodes in the graph while minimizing the total cost or weight.

Note: Since the text does not provide explicit links, formulae, or technical details beyond what has been paraphrased into this summary, these have not been included here.

### Rooted trees Video• . Duration: 8 minutes 8 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

A rooted tree is a directed tree with one distinguished vertex (root) that has a directed path to every other vertex. The depth and height of a node are defined as the number of edges from the root to the node and the longest path from the node to a leaf, respectively. The depth of a tree is the maximum path length across all nodes. A binary tree is a rooted tree with each vertex having two or fewer children, while a ternary tree has three or fewer children. An m-ary tree has m or fewer children at each level and can be regular if every internal node has exactly m children. Two graphs are isomorphic if there exists a bijection that preserves adjacency and non-adjacency. Isomorphic trees may not be isomorphic as rooted trees, as the root mapping must also preserve the structure of the tree.

### Binary search trees Video• . Duration: 14 minutes 14 min

I can provide a solution to the problem based on the provided transcript.

The problem is not explicitly stated in the transcript, but it appears that the task is to understand and summarize the content of the lecture on binary search trees.

Here's a summary of the key points:

1. Definition of Binary Search Trees:
A binary search tree (BST) is a data structure consisting of nodes arranged in a binary tree, where each node has at most two children (i.e., left child and right child). Each node represents a value or key, and the left subtree of a node contains values less than the node's value, while the right subtree contains values greater than the node's value.

2. Uses of Binary Search Trees:
BSTs are used in various applications, including:
	* Database indexing
	* File systems
	* Web search engines
	* Compilers

3. Building a Binary Search Tree:
To build a BST, we start with an empty tree and recursively add nodes to the left or right of existing nodes, ensuring that the left subtree of a node contains values less than the node's value.

4. Relationship between Number of Stored Records and Height of the Binary Tree:
The height of a binary tree is directly related to the number of stored records. As the number of stored records increases, the height of the tree also increases.

5. Binary Search Algorithm:
The binary search algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the search space in half until the target value is found. It starts by comparing the search element to the middle term of the list and then splits the list into two smaller sub-lists based on the comparison result.

Let's assume that the task is to write a summary of the lecture on binary search trees. Here's a possible answer:

Binary Search Trees are data structures consisting of nodes arranged in a binary tree, where each node represents a value or key. BSTs are used in various applications, including database indexing, file systems, and web search engines.

### Rooted trees Reading• . Duration: 15 minutes 15 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences:

Rooted trees are a fundamental concept in graph theory with applications in computer science, data structures, and algorithms. Understanding rooted trees enables tackling problems involving hierarchical structures and recursive data. Key concepts include the definition of a rooted tree, identifying its components (root, parent, child, sibling, leaf, internal nodes), and understanding tree levels and height. There are different types of rooted trees, including binary trees with at most two children, balanced trees like AVL trees and Red-Black trees, and binary search trees (BSTs). BSTs facilitate efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations by maintaining a balanced structure. The lesson covers the basics of rooted trees and binary search trees, including video lectures, reading materials, practice assignments, and discussion prompts. Understanding rooted trees equips students with skills to tackle problems involving hierarchical structures and recursive data in computer science and algorithms.

### Binary search trees Reading• . Duration: 15 minutes 15 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

A binary search tree (BST) is a type of binary tree that maintains a sorted order of elements, where each node contains a value, pointer to the left child, and pointer to the right child. The BST property states that the left subtree of a node contains only nodes with values less than the node's value, while the right subtree contains nodes with values greater than the node's value. Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees. A binary search tree can be built by inserting records into it in a specific order, ensuring that the BST property is maintained. The height of a binary search tree can be found using various algorithms or formulas. Binary search trees are used to efficiently search for values on a sorted list by traversing the tree from the root node to find the desired value. To build a binary search tree, one needs to understand how to insert records into it and ensure that the BST property is maintained.

### Topic 8 summary Reading• . Duration: 15 minutes 15 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving all key information:

Trees are essential in discrete mathematics and computer science due to their applications in hierarchical data representation, efficient data structures, algorithm design, database management, artificial intelligence, computational biology, and network design. A tree is a connected, acyclic graph with n vertices that has n-1 edges. A rooted tree is a tree with one designated root node, where every node (except the root) has exactly one parent. The components of trees include the root, leaf, internal node, height, and depth/level. There are two types of trees: binary trees, which have at most two children (left and right), and balanced trees, which maintain a balanced height to ensure efficient operations. Binary search trees (BSTs) are used to search for values in sorted lists, while Prim's algorithm finds the minimum spanning tree by building it one vertex at a time. Kruskal's algorithm also finds the minimum spanning tree but by adding edges in order of increasing weight and ensuring no cycles are formed. The sum of degrees of all vertices in a tree is 2(n-1), where n is the number of vertices, and a tree with n vertices has n-1 edges.

### Definition of a relation: relation versus function Video• . Duration: 8 minutes 8 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and concepts:

A relation between two sets A and B can be defined as a link or connection between elements of set A to elements of set B. The letter R is often used to refer to a relation. A relation can also be defined between elements of the same set, such as "son of" linking x to y. The Cartesian product of two sets A and B (A × B) is defined as a set of pairs (x, y) where x is an element of A and y is an element of B. A binary relation from A to B can be represented as a subset of the Cartesian product A × B. Relations between elements of the same set are also studied, such as the "less than" relation on the set {1, 2, 3}, where 1 is related to 2, 2 is related to 3, and so on. The concept of relations in mathematics was introduced, covering topics such as Cartesian products, relations between elements of two sets, and properties of relations.

### Matrix and graph representations of a relation Video• . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

A relation can be represented using matrices, digraphs, or other mathematical structures. In matrix representation, each element of the set A is a row and column, with the element M_ij being 1 if a_i is related to b_j and 0 otherwise. The cardinality of A (n_a) determines the number of rows and columns in the matrix. For example, the relation of who is enrolled in which class can be represented by a matrix where Sofia is enrolled in CS100, Samir is enrolled in CS101, and Sarah is enrolled in CS102. Relations can also be combined using matrices, such as the union (joint) or intersection (meet) of two relations. The digraph representation of a relation shows an arrow from x to y if and only if x is related to y. For example, the relation "divides" on the set A can be represented by a digraph where each element divides itself, with arrows indicating the relationship between elements.

### The properties of a relation: reflexive, symmetric and anti-symmetric Video• . Duration: 14 minutes 14 min

## Step 1: Understand the task
The task is to provide a summary of the concepts covered in the lecture on relations, specifically focusing on the properties of reflexivity, symmetry, and anti-symmetry.

## Step 2: Identify key concepts
Reflexivity refers to a relation where each element is related to itself. Symmetry occurs when if A is related to B, then B must also be related to A. Anti-symmetry happens when if A is related to B and B is related to A, then A must equal B.

## Step 3: Summarize the concepts
- Reflexivity: A relation where each element is related to itself.
- Symmetry: If A is related to B, then B is also related to A.
- Anti-symmetry: If A is related to B and B is related to A, then A equals B.

## Step 4: Provide examples
Examples of relations include:
- Reflexive relations: {(a,a), (b,b)}
- Symmetric relations: {(1,2), (2,1)}
- Anti-symmetric relations: {(1,1), (2,2)}

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$

### Relation properties: transitivity Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

A relation R on a set S is said to be transitive if for all a, b, c in S, if a is related to b and b is related to c, then a must be related to c. The digraph of a transitive relation has no cycles or loops. To define the transitivity of a relation, we examine examples such as the relation defined by x being less than or equal to y (R = ≤). This relation is positive because if x ≤ y and y ≤ z, then x ≤ z. However, the relation defined by 2, 3 and 2, 2 is not transitive because three is related to two and two is related to three, but three is not related to three. The relation defined by a being an ancestor of b is transitive because if a is an ancestor of b and b is an ancestor of c, then a is an ancestor of c. To determine if a relation is transitive, we can try to find the minimum number of edges to be added to make it transitive on its corresponding digraph G.

### The properties of a relation: reflexive, symmetric and anti-symmetric Reading• . Duration: 15 minutes 15 min

## Step 1: Review the problem
The problem asks us to analyze three types of relations on a set A: reflexive, symmetric, and anti-symmetric.

## Step 2: Recall definitions
- Reflexive relation: For every element a in A, (a, a) is in R.
- Symmetric relation: If (a, b) is in R for some elements a and b in A, then (b, a) is also in R.
- Anti-symmetric relation: If (a, b) is in R and (b, a) is in R for some elements a and b in A, then a = b.

## Step 3: Analyze examples
- Reflexive example: Let A = {1, 2, 3} and R = {(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)}. Here, every element is related to itself.
- Symmetric example: Let A = {1, 2} and R = {(1, 2), (2, 1)}. Here, if (a, b) is in R, then (b, a) is also in R.
- Anti-symmetric example: Let A = {1, 2, 3} and R = {(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3), (1, 2)}. Here, if (a, b) and (b, a) are in R, then a = b.

## Step 4: Identify key properties
- Reflexive relations are those where every element is related to itself.
- Symmetric relations are those where the order of elements does not matter.
- Anti-symmetric relations are those where if an element is related to another, the other element must be the same one.

## Step 5: Summarize findings
Understanding reflexive, symmetric, and anti-symmetric relations on a set A is crucial in discrete mathematics and computer science. These properties can help analyze and work with data structures such as graphs and databases.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$

## Week 18

### Equivalence relations and equivalence classes Video• . Duration: 6 minutes 6 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and concepts:

An equivalence relation is defined as a relation R on a set S that satisfies three properties: reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity. This means that for all elements a, b, and c in S, the following conditions must hold: (1) aR = a (reflexivity), (2) if aR then bR (symmetry), and (3) if aR and bR then cR (transitivity). Equivalence relations partition the set S into disjoint subsets called equivalence classes. The equivalence class of an element a is the subset of S containing all elements related to a by the relation R. For example, consider the relation on integers where two numbers are related if they have the same parity (i.e., both odd or both even). This relation satisfies the properties of reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity, making it an equivalence relation, which partitions the set of integers into two equivalence classes: {1, 3, 5} and {2, 4}. The concept of equivalence relations can be applied to other sets as well, not just integers.

### Partial and total order Video• . Duration: 6 minutes 6 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

A relation R on elements in a set S is said to be a partial order if it satisfies three properties: reflexivity, anti-symmetry, and transitivity. An example of a partial order is the relation R on integers Z where a ≤ b for all a, b ∈ Z. Another example is the relation R' on positive integers Z+ where a | b for all a, b ∈ Z+, which also satisfies these properties. A total order is defined as a partial order where for any two elements a and b in the set S, either a ≤ b or b ≤ a. An example of a total order is the same relation R on integers Z discussed earlier, which is reflexive, anti-symmetric, and transitive, and also satisfies the property that for any two elements a and b ∈ Z, either a ≤ b or b ≤ a. On the other hand, a relation like the one defined by divisibility on positive integers Z+ is a partial order but not a total order because some elements are incomparable (e.g., 5 and 7). Understanding partial and total orders is important in mathematical structures such as groups, rings, and fields. The concept of equivalence relations, which include partial and total orders, will be further explored in the next lesson.

Note: I removed all non-essential content from the original text, including video transcripts, reading materials, practice assignments, and discussion prompts.

### Equivalence relations and equivalence classes Reading• . Duration: 15 minutes 15 min

## Step 1: Identify the problem statement
The problem is asking to describe a specific type of mathematical relationship called an "equivalence relation" and its application in partitioning a set into disjoint subsets.

## Step 2: Define an equivalence relation
An equivalence relation is a binary relation that satisfies three properties:
- Reflexivity: Every element is related to itself.
- Symmetry: If one element is related to another, the reverse relationship also holds.
- Transitivity: If two elements are related to a third, then those first two elements must be related.

## Step 3: Explain how equivalence relations partition a set
An equivalence relation partitions a set into disjoint subsets, called equivalence classes. Each element in the original set belongs to exactly one of these classes based on the relationship defined by the equivalence relation.

## Step 4: Provide an example of an equivalence relation
Consider the set A = {1,2,3,4} and the relation R = {(1,1),(2,2),(3,3),(4,4),(1,3),(3,1)}. This relation satisfies the properties of reflexivity (each element is related to itself), symmetry (if (a,b) is in R, then (b,a) is also in R), and transitivity (for any a, b, and c, if (a,b) and (b,c) are in R, then (a,c) is also in R).

## Step 5: Determine the equivalence classes of the given relation
For each element in A under the relation R:
- [1] = {1,3} because both 1 and 3 are related to each other.
- [2] = {2} because 2 is only related to itself.
- [3] = {1,3} because 1 and 3 are also related.
- [4] = {4} because 4 is only related to itself.

## Step 6: Summarize the properties of equivalence relations
Equivalence relations partition a set into disjoint subsets (equivalence classes) where each element belongs to exactly one class based on the relation. The relation must be reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$

### The basics of counting Video• . Duration: 14 minutes 14 min

This appears to be a transcription of a lecture or tutorial on combinatorics, specifically on the basics of counting rules such as product, addition, subtraction, and division rules. Here's a summary of the main points:

**Introduction**

* The topic is introduced as combinatorics, which deals with counting and arranging objects.

**Basic Counting Rules**

* **Product Rule**: If there are m ways to perform one task and n ways to perform another task, then there are m × n ways to perform both tasks.
* **Addition Rule**: If there are m ways to perform the first task and n ways to perform the second task, then the total number of ways is m + n.
* **Subtraction Rule** (also known as Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion): If there are m ways to perform one task and n ways to perform another task that intersect with each other, then the total number of ways is m + n - (number of intersections).
* **Division Rule**: If there are m ways to perform a task and d ways to choose from each way, then the total number of ways is m ÷ d.

**Examples**

* Product rule: Counting the number of binary strings of length 8 that start with one bit or end with two bits zero zero.
* Addition rule: Counting the number of different seating arrangements for four people around a table where two arrangements are considered the same when each person has the same left and right neighbor.
* Subtraction rule: Counting the number of binary strings of length 8 that start with one bit or end with two bits zero zero, taking into account intersections.

**Practice Assignments**

* The basics of counting
* The pigeonhole principle
* Permutations and combinations

Note that this is just a summary, and the actual lecture or tutorial may cover more details and examples.

### The pigeonhole principle Video• . Duration: 7 minutes 7 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The Pigeonhole Principle states that if K+1 objects are placed into K boxes, then at least one box contains two or more objects. This can be proved by contra-positive, where assuming none of the K boxes has more than one object leads to a contradiction with the initial statement. The principle is generalized to N objects in K boxes, where there exists at least one box containing at least ⌈N/K⌉ objects. An example demonstrates the application of the principle, showing that with 10 pigeons and only 9 pigeonholes, one hole contains two pigeons. A function F is not one-to-one if its domain has K+1 elements and its co-domain has K elements, as at least one box in the co-domain will contain more than one pre-image. The principle can be used to determine the minimum number of cards needed to guarantee that at least four cards of the same suit are chosen from a standard deck of 52 cards, which is found to be 13. This concept is discussed further through videos, practice assignments, and reading materials on combinatorics and permutations. The pigeonhole principle has applications in various fields, including mathematics and computer science.

### Permutations and combinations Video• . Duration: 9 minutes 9 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and concepts:

Permutations refer to the number of arrangements of distinct elements in a set, where order matters. The formula for permutations is P(n,r) = n! / (n-r)!, where n is the total number of elements and r is the number of elements being arranged. To solve counting problems using permutations, one can use the product rule to calculate the number of ways to choose each element. For example, the number of three permutations of a set containing 50 elements is equal to 50! / (50-3)!. Combinations, on the other hand, refer to unordered selections of elements from a set, where order does not matter. The formula for combinations is C(n,r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!), which can be calculated using factorials. In the example of selecting three prize winners from 50 people, the number of possible ways is equal to C(50,3).

### The representation of a set using Venn diagrams Video• . Duration: 4 minutes 4 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

A Venn diagram is used to visualize the possible relations among a collection of sets and represents the universal set as an area in red. A set A can be represented by an area in red within the universal set U. The complement of a set A (denoted as A') contains all elements in the universal set U not in A, which can be calculated as U - A. The union of two sets A and B is always equal to the universal set, represented by the area in red for both sets combined. The intersection of two sets A and B represents the areas where both sets overlap. The symmetric difference of two sets A and B is represented by the area in red, which can be shown as the union of A and B minus their intersection. Venn diagrams can be used to compare and calculate set operations such as union, intersection, and complement, allowing for visual representation and understanding of these concepts.

### De Morgan's laws Video• . Duration: 8 minutes 8 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

Augustus De Morgan was a British mathematician who formulated De Morgan's laws, which describe the relationship between mathematical statements and their opposites. The first law states that the complement of the union of two sets is equal to the intersection of their complements, while the second law states that the complement of the intersection of two sets is equal to the union of their complements. These laws can be proven using membership tables or Venn diagrams. For example, in a membership table, the column corresponding to the complement of the union of A and B is the same as the column corresponding to the intersection of the complements of A and B. This demonstrates that De Morgan's laws are equivalent for sets. Additionally, the laws can be proven using Venn diagrams by showing that the areas in orange are the same for both diagrams. The second law can also be proved using a similar approach, where the diagram corresponding to the complement of the intersection of A and B is the same as the diagram corresponding to the union of the complements of A and B.

### Laws of sets: Commutative, associative and distributives Video• . Duration: 11 minutes 11 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

Commutativity refers to an operation where the order of elements does not affect the result. For example, addition and multiplication are commutative, but subtraction is not. Set operations like union and intersection are also commutative. However, set difference is not commutative. Associativity concerns the grouping of elements in an operation, and examples include addition, union, intersection, and symmetric difference being associative. Distributivity states that multiplying a sum by a number gives the same result as multiplying each term separately, and this law applies to sets. Set identities like De Morgan's law and absorption laws can be used to simplify set expressions and solve problems.

### Partition of a set Video• . Duration: 3 minutes 3 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

A partition of an object is a subdivision into parts that are completely separated from each other while forming the whole object. Data partitioning has applications in big data analysis. Two sets A and B are disjoint if their intersection is equal to the empty set, as shown in the Venn diagram. A partition of a set A is a collection of subsets A_i that are disjoint and whose union equals A. The given example illustrates this concept with subsets A_1 to A_5 of set A, where each subset is disjoint from the others and their union forms A. To determine if a given collection of subsets is a partition of a set S containing five elements {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, one must check that all subsets are mutually disjoint and their union equals S. The first option is not a correct partition because the subset {3, 4} intersects with the subset {4, 5}. Similarly, other options fail to meet the criteria of being mutually disjoint or having a union equal to S.

Note: I didn't include links, formulae, or technical details that were not essential for understanding the main concept of partitioning a set. If you'd like me to clarify anything or add more information, please let me know!

### Answer to question 8 on the problem sheet Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

A Venn diagram with three binary digits (A, B, and C) is used to divide a universal set U into eight disjoint regions. The subset X is defined by a membership table and can be represented as the union of A and C minus the intersection of B and C. The set Y is described by the region 000, 011, 101, 110, and 111 in the Venn diagram and can be represented as the complement of the symmetric difference of A, B, and C. The symmetric difference contains elements that are in A, B, or C but not in all three. The complement of the symmetric difference is equal to U minus the symmetric difference of A, B, and C, which corresponds to set Y. To draw a Venn diagram with eight disjoint regions, each digit should be 1 for the corresponding subset (A, B, and C). The simplest way to describe X in set notation is as the union of A and C minus the intersection of B and C. Set Y can also be represented using set notation by describing its complement as U minus the symmetric difference of A, B, and C.

### Answer to question 11 on the problem sheet Video• . Duration: 2 minutes 2 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

A transcript provides examples to demonstrate various set operations. Let A = [1, 2] and B = [2, 3]. The intersection of two sets is given by elements present in both sets, so A ∩ B = [2]. The powerset of a set S is the set containing all subsets of S. For example, P(A ∩ B) = {[ }, {2}].

The union of two sets is given by elements present in either set, so A ∪ B = [1, 2, 3]. The powerset of A ∪ B contains all possible subsets, including empty set, individual elements, and combined elements. 

Additionally, the Cartesian product (A × B) produces ordered pairs where each element comes from a different set, in this case A × B = [(1,2), (1,3), (2,2), (2,3)]. The powerset of A × B includes all possible subsets of these ordered pairs.

### Laws of sets: Commutative, associative and distributives Reading• . Duration: 15 minutes 15 min

## Step 1: Understand the laws of sets
The laws of sets are fundamental principles used in set theory, which is a branch of mathematics. They provide rules for manipulating and combining sets in various ways. The main laws include the complement law, distributive law, absorption law, idempotent law, commutative law, associative law, and De Morgan's law.

## Step 2: Identify the specific problem
The problem asks us to simplify the given expression (A∪B)∩(A∪B c ) using the laws of sets.

## Step 3: Apply the distributive law
First, we apply the distributive law, which states that A ∪ (B ∩ C) = (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ C). We can rewrite the given expression as (A∪B)∩(A∪B c ) = ((A∪B)∩(A))∪((A∪B)∩(B c )).

## Step 4: Simplify using complement law
Using the complement law, we know that A ∩ B c = ∅. So, ((A∪B)∩(B c )) = ∅.

## Step 5: Apply absorption law
Now, we have (A∪B)∩(A) = (A ∪ B) ∩ A = A ∪ (B ∩ A).

## Step 6: Use distributive law again
We can rewrite the expression as A ∪ (B ∩ A). Using the distributive law, we get (A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ B c ) = ((A ∪ B) ∩ A) ∪ ((A ∪ B) ∩ (B c )).

## Step 7: Simplify using idempotent law
Since (A ∪ B) ∩ (B c ) = ∅, we can simplify the expression as (A ∪ B) ∩ (A).

## Step 8: Apply absorption law again
Using the absorption law, we know that A ∪ A = A. So, ((A ∪ B) ∩ A) = A.

The final answer is: $\boxed{A}$

### Binomial coefficients and identities Video• . Duration: 9 minutes 9 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The binomial theorem states that for two variables x and y and a non-negative integer n, the expression x + y^n can be expanded as the sum from k=0 to k=n of (n choose k) * x^k * y^(n-k). The binomial theorem is used to expand expressions with multiple terms connected by a plus or minus sign. For example, expanding x + y^2 can be done using the binomial theorem, resulting in x + 2xy + y^2. The formula for binomial coefficients is (n choose k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!), where ! denotes factorial. Pascal's identity states that (n+1 choose k) = (n+1 choose k-1) + (n choose k). Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of numbers, with each number being the sum of the two directly above it. The binomial theorem can be used to show that 2^n equals the sum from k=0 to n of (n choose k), which also represents the total number of subsets of a set with n elements. Pascal's identity is used to simplify complicated binomial coefficients, and is the basis for the geometric arrangement of binomial coefficients in Pascal's triangle.

### Generalised permutations and combinations Video• . Duration: 11 minutes 11 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

Permutations with repetition refer to the number of ways to select r objects from a set of n elements with repetition allowed, which can be calculated as n^r. This is because for each object selection, there are n possibilities to choose from, resulting in a total of n * n * ... (n times) possible selections. In contrast, permutations without repetition refer to the number of ways to select r objects from a set of n elements with no repetition allowed, which can be calculated as n! / (n-r)!.

The formula for combinations with and without repetition is given by: combinations with repetition = C(n+k-1, k), where n is the total number of elements and k is the number of selected elements. Combinations without repetition = C(n, k). These formulas can be used to solve various counting problems in combinatorics.

The concept of distinguishable objects and boxes is also discussed, which deals with the number of ways to distribute distinct objects into identical boxes or vice versa. The table provided summarizes the formulae for permutations and combinations in different cases.

For example, if John must be one of the people selected to form a committee of three from 10 people, we can use the combination without repetition formula to calculate the number of possible committees as C(9, 2) = 36.

### Distinguishable objects and boxes Video• . Duration: 9 minutes 9 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

Counting problems can be reduced to distributing k objects into n boxes, where objects can be either distinguishable or indistinguishable. Distributing k distinguishable balls into n distinguishable boxes with exclusion is equivalent to forming a permutation of size k from a set of size n, resulting in n! / (k!) ways. Conversely, without exclusion, the number of ways to place k distinguishable balls into n boxes is n^k. When distributing indistinguishable balls into distinguishable boxes with exclusion, the result is equivalent to forming a combination of size k from a set of size n, yielding n! / (k!(n-k)!). Without exclusion, this becomes n+k-1 choose k times n!/(k!*(n-1)!). The problem of placing 8 indistinguishable balls into 6 distinguishable boxes can be solved using the formula for combinations with repetition, resulting in 13 choose 8 = 1,287 ways. This lecture introduces various counting problems that can be modeled by distributing objects into boxes, covering different scenarios such as distinguishable and indistinguishable objects and boxes, with and without exclusion.

### Binomial coefficients and identities Reading• . Duration: 15 minutes 15 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving all key information:

Binomial coefficients represent the number of ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements without regard to order. The binomial coefficient (k/n) is defined as the product of factorials: k! / ((n-k)! * n!). Binomial coefficients have symmetry and Pascal's rule, which describe how they relate to each other in terms of inclusion and exclusion. Pascal's rule states that (k/n) = (k-1/(n-1)) + (k/(n-1)). The binomial theorem describes the expansion of a binomial power as an infinite sum of products of coefficients and powers of x and y. Binomial coefficients are central to combinatorics, algebra, probability, statistics, and have numerous applications in mathematics. They provide tools for counting, probability, and algebraic manipulations. Understanding binomial coefficients is essential for solving problems in these fields.

### The definition of a function Video• . Duration: 11 minutes 11 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

A function is a relation between a set of inputs (called the domain) and a set of possible outputs (called the co-domain). The range of a function is the subset of the co-domain that contains all possible output values. To find the domain, co-domain, and range of a function, we need to analyze its definition and any given information about it. For example, if a function f maps each element x in set Z to its corresponding absolute value, then the domain and co-domain of f are both Z, and the range is all integers greater than or equal to 0. The image of an input element can be found by applying the function's definition to that element. If a relation between two sets is not a function, it may have multiple outputs for each input or lack an output for certain inputs. In contrast, a function always has exactly one output for each input. By understanding functions and their properties, we can analyze and solve problems involving rules and mappings.

### Plotting functions Video• . Duration: 9 minutes 9 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

A linear function f(x) = ax + b has a gradient of 'a' and passes through (0,b). If 'a' is positive, the function is increasing; otherwise, it's decreasing. A quadratic function f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c has a domain of all real numbers and a range that depends on the vertex. An exponential function f(x) = b^x has a base 'b' greater than 0 and not equal to 1, with properties including b^(x+y) = b^x * b^y and b^(xy) = (b^x)^y. The laws of exponents state that b^(-x) = 1/b^x and a*b^x = a*(b^x)^y. Exponential functions with bases greater than 1 represent growth, while those with bases less than 1 represent decay. The graphs of these functions have asymptotes at x=0 for exponential functions and at y=a for quadratic functions.

### Injective and surjective functions Reading• . Duration: 15 minutes 15 min

## Step 1: Understand the definitions of injective, surjective, and bijective functions.
An injective function is a function where every element in the codomain is mapped to by at most one element from the domain. A surjective function is a function where every element in the codomain is mapped to by at least one element from the domain. A bijective function is a function that is both injective and surjective.

## Step 2: Analyze the given examples of functions.
The example functions are:
- f:{1,2,3}→{a,b,c,d} defined by f(1)=a, f(2)=b, f(3)=c.
- g:{1,2,3}→{a,b,c} defined by g(1)=a, g(2)=a, g(3)=b.

## Step 3: Determine the characteristics of each function based on the definitions.
- The first function f is both injective and surjective because every element in the codomain {a,b,c,d} is mapped to by exactly one element from the domain {1,2,3}.
- The second function g is not injective because two elements (1 and 2) map to the same element a in the codomain. However, it is surjective because every element in the codomain {a,b,c} is mapped to by at least one element from the domain {1,2,3}.
- The third function f:{1,2,3}→{a,b,c} defined by f(1)=a, f(2)=b, f(3)=c is both injective and surjective because every element in the codomain {a,b,c} is mapped to by exactly one element from the domain {1,2,3}.

## Step 4: Determine which functions are bijective based on their characteristics.
The function f:{1,2,3}→{a,b,c,d} defined by f(1)=a, f(2)=b, f(3)=c is bijective because it is both injective and surjective. However, the other examples do not meet all criteria for bijectivity.

## Step 5: Provide a conclusion based on the analysis.
Based on the definitions of injective, surjective, and bijective functions, we can conclude that only some functions satisfy all three conditions.

The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$

### Topic 2 problem sheet and solutions Reading• . Duration: 45 minutes 45 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The problem sheet is part of the functions problem sheet and asks to attempt exercises 1 to 4 and 10. The problem involves understanding set theory and function notation. Two sets A = {x, y, z} and B = {1, 2, 3, 4} are given, and we need to determine which arrow diagrams define functions from A to B. The second part of the problem sheet introduces a function f from A to B defined by an arrow diagram and asks us to find its domain, co-domain, range, pre-images, and represent it as a set of ordered pairs. The Hamming distance function is also introduced, which measures the difference between two strings of 0's and 1's of the same length. The function H is defined as follows: for all n, the set S_n of all strings of 0's and 1's of length n is considered, and H is a measure of the difference between two strings in this set. To complete the problem sheet, we need to attempt exercises 1-4 and 10.

### Function composition Video• . Duration: 4 minutes 4 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

Function composition is defined as F ∘ G (X), which means applying function G to X first and then applying function F to the result. This can be broken down into two stages: first getting the output of function G, and then using that output as input for function F. The composition of two functions F and G is denoted as F ∘ G of X, and it results in a new function. Function composition is not commutative, meaning that the order of the functions matters and changing it changes the result. For example, if F(X) = 2X + 3 and G(X) = 3X + 2, then F ∘ G of X = (F ∘ G)(X) = F(G(X)) = 2(3X + 2) + 3 = 6X + 7, whereas G ∘ F of X = (G ∘ F)(X) = G(F(X)) = 3(2X + 3) + 2 = 6X + 11. This demonstrates that the order of composition affects the outcome. Function composition has practical applications in various fields, such as computer science and engineering.

Note: I removed some technical details and focused on the most important concepts and findings, while preserving key information.

### Bijective functions Video• . Duration: 11 minutes 11 min

There is no specific problem or question provided in the transcript to solve. The transcript appears to be a lesson plan for a mathematics course, specifically on functions and their properties.

However, if you'd like, I can help with summarizing the key points from the transcript:

1. A function is defined as a relation between a set of inputs (called the domain) and a set of possible outputs (called the range).
2. A bijection, also known as a bijective function, is a one-to-one correspondence between two sets.
3. To prove that a function is a bijection, you need to show that it is both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto).

If you have any specific questions or problems related to functions or their properties, I'd be happy to try and help!

### The floor and ceiling functions Video• . Duration: 12 minutes 12 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The floor function is defined as the largest integer less than or equal to a real number x, denoted as ⌊x⌋. The ceiling function is defined as the smallest integer greater than or equal to a real number x, denoted as ⌈x⌉. For example, ⌊2.9⌋ = 2 and ⌈3⌉ = 3. The floor of any integer is equal to itself, while the ceiling of an integer is also equal to itself. To prove that the floor of x + n is equal to the floor of x plus n, we use the definition of the floor function and add n to both sides of the inequality. This implies that ⌊x⌋ + n is less than or equal to ⌊x + n⌋, which is strictly less than ⌊x + n⌋ + 1. The proof demonstrates a key property of the floor function.

### Answer to question 1 on the problem sheet Video• . Duration: 7 minutes 7 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and concepts:

The problem discusses two functions, f and g, which map sets A, B, and C to each other. The function f maps set A {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} to set B {a, b, c, d}, while the function g maps set B {a, b, c, d} to set C {w, x, y, z}. To represent the functions f and g, an arrow diagram is drawn, showing the mappings between sets A, B, and C. The domain of a function is the set of all inputs, while the co-domain is the set of all possible outputs. The range of a function is the set of all actual outputs. Using the given tables for functions f and g, it is shown that f is not one-to-one because two elements in set A map to the same element in set B, but it is onto because every element in the co-domain has at least one pre-image. Similarly, function g is both one-to-one and onto because every element in its range has a unique pre-image in its domain. Overall, the problem provides an introduction to functions, including their domains, co-domains, ranges, and properties such as being one-to-one or onto.

### Answer to question 7 on the problem sheet Video• . Duration: 3 minutes 3 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The floor function F(X) maps real numbers to their largest integer less than or equal to X. To find the floor of π, which lies between 3 and 4, we take the floor of -2.5 (which equals -3), and finally apply the floor function to -1, resulting in -1. The graph of F(X) shows that each element of the range has more than one pre-image, making it not a 1-to-1 or injective function. This means that the floor function is not onto, as there exists an x for which the floor of x is not equal to any element in the codomain. However, every element of the domain does have a pre-image under the floor function. The graph also shows that multiple inputs can map to the same output, violating the injective property. To justify whether the floor function is onto or not, we note that for all n in the set of real numbers, there exists an x such that F(x) = n.

### Topic 2 summary Reading• . Duration: 15 minutes 15 min

Here are the 8 sentences summarizing the text:

The study of functions provides essential skills and knowledge for understanding and applying mathematical concepts in various contexts, particularly in programming where functions are modular units of code designed to perform specific tasks.

Functions have a definition: A function f maps one element from set A to a unique element in set B, denoted as f:A→B. Understanding the domain, co-domain, and range of a function is crucial.

There are properties of functions such as injectivity (one-to-one), surjectivity (onto), and bijectivity, which need to be understood. The inverse function exists for some functions, with a relationship between f and its inverse f −1. Plotting graphs of functions involves understanding if the function is injective or surjective.

Function composition is a concept where (f∘g) = f(g()). Understanding specific functions like linear, quadratic, ceiling, floor, exponential, and logarithmic functions is also essential. Regularly assessing understanding against learning outcomes is crucial to identify areas for improvement and develop an action plan to improve knowledge and skills.

To improve understanding, strategies include reviewing course materials and textbooks, seeking additional resources, practicing problems, seeking help from instructors or peers, scheduling study sessions, and regularly reviewing progress.

## Week 5

### Introduction to propositional logic Video• . Duration: 2 minutes 2 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

Propositional logic is a branch of logic that studies mathematical statements, serving as the basis for reasoning and constructing mathematical theories. It originated with Aristotle and is an algebra of propositions, using operators such as ∧ (and), ∨ (or), ¬ (not), ⇒ (implies), and if-and-only-if. Propositional logic can be used in computer circuit design, programming languages like Prolog, and systems like theorem provers and artificial intelligence applications. It is a fundamental concept in computer science and has numerous applications. The original propositional logic formula was: A ∧ B = True if and only if both A and B are true (A → B) . This can also be expressed as: ¬(A ∨ B) = False if either A or B, but not both, is false (¬(A ∨ B)). Propositional logic can also be used to express compound propositions using logical operators. The next topic will cover predicate logic, a more powerful form of logic that extends the capabilities of propositional logic.

### Propositions Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

A proposition in mathematics is a declarative sentence that is either true or false, but not both. Propositions are the fundamental building blocks of logic and serve as the basis for reasoning and logical statements. The statement "London is the capital of United Kingdom" is an example of a proposition and is considered to be true. Similarly, "1 plus 1 equals 2" and "2 is less than 3" are propositions, also true. On the other hand, "Madrid is the capital of France" is a proposition that is known to be false. In contrast, statements like "x plus 1 equals 2" and "what time is it?" are not considered propositions because they lack clear truth values. To simplify notation, propositional variables such as p, q, r, and s can be used to represent propositions. By using these variables, complex logical statements can be expressed more concisely and accurately.

### Truth tables and truth sets Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

A truth table is a tabular representation of all possible combinations of its constituents propositional variables. To construct a truth table for n propositional variables, create a table with 2^n rows and n columns, filling it with all possible combinations starting with false values. For example, for three propositional variables p, q, and r, the table will contain eight rows, with alternating patterns of false and true values in each column. A truth set is defined as the set of elements of a given set S for which a proposition p is true, denoted as capital P. Truth sets can be used to analyze compound propositions by considering all possible combinations of their constituent parts. For instance, let S be the set of integers from 1-10 and two propositions p (is even) and q (is odd), with truth sets P = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10} and Q = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}. Truth tables can be used to build a methodology for tracking the truth value of complex propositions. By constructing a truth table and analyzing its columns, we can determine the truth values of compound propositions.

### Compound propositions Video• . Duration: 9 minutes 9 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The lecture introduces the concept of compound statements and logic operators, including negation, conjunction, disjunction, and exclusive-or. The truth tables for each logical operation are examined, showing their truth values based on the input propositions. Negation (not p) is defined as "it is not the case that p" with a truth value opposite to p. Conjunction (p ∧ q) is true only when both p and q are true, while disjunction (p ∨ q) is false only when both p and q are false. Exclusive-or (p ⊕ q) is true when either p or q is true but not both. Compound propositions can be built by combining multiple propositions using parentheses to change the meaning of the propositions. The order of precedence for logical operations determines the correct interpretation, which can be reduced using a set of rules. A practice assignment and reading materials are provided to reinforce understanding of compound propositions and logic operators.

## Week 6

### Logical implication Video• . Duration: 7 minutes 7 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

Logical implication, also known as conditional statements, is a proposition that states if p then q, where p is the hypothesis and q is the conclusion or consequence. The truth table for a conditional statement shows that it is true to think that if the hypothesis is false, then any conclusion can be implied. Conditional statements can be expressed in multiple ways, including "if p then q", "p implies q", and others, which all hold the same meaning. The converse, inverse, and contrapositive of an implication are important related propositions: the converse is q implies p, the inverse is not q implies not p, and the contrapositive is not p implies not q. These propositions can be analyzed using symbolic logic expressions and English statements, such as "not q implies not p". The concept of logical implication has applications in computer logic, including propositions and programming languages. Understanding logical implication is crucial for mastering laws of propositional logic, which include rules governing the use of these implications.

### Logical equivalence Video• . Duration: 6 minutes 6 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The lecture discusses logical equivalence, which is defined as the biconditional statement "p if and only if q", where p implies q and q implies p. Equivalent propositions are those that always have the same truth value, denoted by "p equivalent to q". To determine equivalence, one can use truth tables to compare the two propositions' truth values. The truth table shows that non-p or q is equivalent to p implies q, but not vice versa. For example, if n equals 20, then n is positive (p implies r) and n equals 20, if n is even (q implies p), but not necessarily p implies q. To update the precedence order of compound propositions, we include implication and equivalence, which is now: negation > conjunction > disjunction > implication > equivalence. The lecture also discusses other logical operators, such as non-equivalence, and provides examples to illustrate key concepts.

### Laws of propositional logic Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

Propositional logic is an algebra involving multiple laws that govern the behavior of logical operators. The most important laws include idempotent, commutative, associative, distributive, identity, and domination laws. DeMorgan's laws are used to formalize how we negate conjunction and disjunction. The Distributive Law of disjunction over conjunction states that p or q is equivalent to r, and p or q is equivalent to p or r. This law can be proven by constructing a true table for the compound propositions. Other important equivalences include DeMorgan's laws, Absorption laws, negation laws, and Double Negation laws. The Double Negation law states that not not p is equivalent to p, and it can be used to simplify complex expressions. By applying these laws, we can prove logical equivalence between two compound propositions using a step-by-step process.

Note: I did not include any links as they were not provided in the original text. Also, I did not extract any specific formulae or technical details that were not explicitly mentioned in the text.

### Answer to question 4 on problem sheet Video• . Duration: 3 minutes 3 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The first exercise on propositional logic involves manipulating propositions related to the letter "l" in the word "software". The proposition p states that l is a vowel, while q states that l comes after the letter K in the alphabet. Using the listing method, it can be determined that q comprises the letters O, S, T, R, and W, which come after K in the alphabet. Conversely, note Q represents the letters A, E, and F, which come before K. The next step is to find p ∩ q (p intersect q), which includes only the vowels "A" and "E". To find p ∨ q (p or q), it involves combining all the vowels in the word "software", resulting in a set containing the letters A, E, O, S, T, W, and R. The truth set corresponding to not q includes only the letter F, which comes before K in the alphabet.

### Answer to question 5 on problem sheet Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The second exercise in propositional logic involves constructing a truth table to determine the truth value of logical statements involving two propositions, p and q. The truth table should have at least n columns and 2^n rows, where n is the number of propositions. For two propositions, the table will have 4 rows, with each row representing a possible combination of values for p (0 or 1) and q (0 or 1). To construct the truth table, additional columns are needed to represent negations of p and q. The first logical statement is "p or q", which is true in all cases except when both p and q are 0. The second statement is "p and q", which is true only when both p and q are 1. A third statement, "not p or not q", is also constructed and found to be equivalent to "not p and not q" by DeMorgan's law. This equivalence demonstrates that the two statements are logically equivalent, and can be used in various logical arguments.

I did not include links, formulae, or technical details as they were not explicitly mentioned in the text.

### Propositional logic webinar Video• . Duration: 1 hour 35 minutes 1h 35m

This appears to be a transcript of an online tutoring session or lecture, specifically a lesson on propositional logic. Here is a summary of the main points covered in the lesson:

**Key Takeaways**

* Propositional logic is a branch of logic that deals with statements that are either true or false.
* The proposition "for all x, there exists y such that pxy" implies that for every individual x, there is at least one individual y for which the statement pxy is true.
* This does not necessarily imply that for every individual x and for every individual y, the statement pxy is true.

**Method of Solution**

To prove or disprove this statement, we can use a counterexample. If we find an example where the statement is false, then we know that the original statement is also false.

**Example Counterexample**

Let's say we have a proposition "px" and we want to show whether it's true for all x. We can try to find a counterexample where p is not true for some value of x. For instance, if we let p be "it's raining outside", then for any given day, there might be times when it's not raining outside. Therefore, this proposition would not hold for all values of x.

**K-Map**

The K-Map is a useful tool in propositional logic to simplify and solve problems. When working with the K-Map, we need to identify which variables are fixed (don't change) and which ones are changing. We then use these observations to find viable solutions that satisfy our conditions.

**Midterm Assessment**

For those taking online courses or assignments related to this material, it's recommended to keep an eye on dates related to assignments and assessments as mentioned in the last part of the transcript.

Let me know if you have any specific questions about propositional logic or any other topic!

### Logical implication Reading• . Duration: 15 minutes 15 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

Logical implication (p→q) is a fundamental concept in propositional logic that represents "if p then q". The truth table for p→q shows that it is false only when p is true and q is false; otherwise, it is true. The implication p→q can be read as "If it is raining, then the ground is wet" or other similar statements. When p is true and q is true, the implication p→q is true. When p is true and q is false, the implication p→q is false. When p is false, the implication p→q is always true regardless of q's truth value. The implication p→q can be applied to real-world statements, such as "If it is raining, then the ground is wet", which would be true only when it is indeed raining and the ground is wet, but true regardless if it's not raining.

---

### Non-equivalence Reading• . Duration: 15 minutes 15 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences:

To prove that two propositions are equivalent, it's sufficient to build the truth table for each proposition. If the truth values of the two propositions are the same (identical columns), they are equivalent. However, if there is a case where the propositions have different truth values, they are not equivalent. The truth tables for p → q and ¬p → ¬q were compared to show that these two propositions are not equivalent. On the other hand, the truth tables for q → p and ¬p → ¬q were compared to show that these two propositions are equivalent. The columns for the last two propositions (q→p and ¬p→¬q) were identical, indicating that they have the same truth values in all cases. This means that if p=F and q=T, then q→p=T and ¬p→¬q=T. Therefore, q→p and ¬p→¬q are equivalent propositions.

Note: I removed all links, formulas, technical details, and extra resources from the original text as they were not essential to understanding the main concepts and findings.

### Topic 3 summary Reading• . Duration: 15 minutes 15 min

I can help with that. However, I notice that there are multiple problems listed, and I'll assume you want me to solve the first problem: "Construct the truth table for (p∧q)∨¬r." Here's my solution:

## Step 1: Define the variables
Let p, q, and r be the propositional variables representing 'It rains', 'The ground is wet', and 'It is raining', respectively.

## Step 2: Construct the truth table
We will construct a truth table with all possible combinations of truth values for p, q, and r.

| p | q | r | (p∧q) | ¬r | (p∧q)∨¬r |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| T | T | T | T | F | T |
| T | T | F | T | T | T |
| T | F | T | F | F | F |
| T | F | F | F | T | T |
| F | T | T | F | F | F |
| F | T | F | F | T | T |
| F | F | T | F | F | F |
| F | F | F | F | T | T |

## Step 3: Analyze the truth table
The final column, (p∧q)∨¬r, represents the propositional expression "(p∧q)∨¬r". We can see that this expression is true whenever either p and q are both true or r is false.

The final answer is: $\boxed{8}$

## Week 7

### Introduction to predicate logic Video• . Duration: 1 minute 1 min

Unfortunately, there is no text to summarize. The provided text appears to be a video transcript and does not contain any specific information or content that can be summarized.

However, I can provide an overview of the main concepts and topics discussed in the transcript:

The transcript introduces the concept of predicate logic, which is a type of logic that can express complex statements in mathematics. It highlights the limitations of propositional logic and explains how predicate logic can be used to formalize reasoning about complex statements.

The examples provided include two statements: "All men are mortal" and "X squared is equal to 4". The transcript notes that these statements cannot be represented by propositional logic, but can be expressed using predicate logic.

The transcript also mentions several practice assignments and videos related to predicate logic, including a video introduction to the topic, videos on predicates, quantification, and nested quantifiers, as well as readings on nested quantifiers.

Overall, the transcript appears to provide an overview of the basics of predicate logic and its applications in mathematics.

### What are predicates? Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

Predicate logic is a solution to the limitations of propositional logic, allowing for the formal description of statements that depend on variables. A predicate is a generalization of a proposition, defined as a function that returns true or false depending on its variables. The statement "x squared is equal to 4" can be formalized as P(x), where P is the predicate "squared is equal to four" and x is the variable. When assigned actual values to x, P(x) becomes a proposition with a truth value. Predicates can have multiple parameters, such as in the example of "x squared is greater than y", which can be evaluated for different combinations of values. The logical operations from propositional logic can also be applied to predicate logic, including conjunction and disjunction. The limitations of propositional logic are demonstrated through examples, where statements like "P of 2 is true" and "Q of 1, 3, z" require formalized treatment using predicate logic. By exploring predicates and their applications, students can gain a deeper understanding of the power and flexibility of predicate logic in solving problems that cannot be addressed by propositional logic alone.

### Quantification Video• . Duration: 9 minutes 9 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The concept of quantifiers in predicate logic expresses the extent to which a predicate is true over a range of elements, conveying meaning similar to the words "all" and "some". The two most important quantifiers are the universal quantifier and the existential quantifier. The universal quantification of a predicate P of x states that P of x is true for all values of x in the universe of discourse, denoted as ∀x P of x. In practice, this can be represented as the conjunction of propositions over all elements in the universe of discourse. The existential quantification of a predicate P of x states that there exists a value x in the universe of discourse such that P of x is true, denoted as ∃x P of x. This concept was demonstrated with examples, including universal and existential statements about university students, computer science students, discrete mathematics courses, and real solutions to equations. The uniqueness quantifier is a special case of the existential quantifier, stating that there exists a unique value of x in the universe of discourse such that P of x is true, denoted as ∃(x, y) P(x, y). This concept was illustrated with examples involving second-degree equations and real solutions.

### Nested quantifiers Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The lecture introduces nested quantifiers, binding variables, and logical operators. Nested quantifiers are used to express statements with multiple variables, such as "for all x, for all y, P(x, y)" meaning that P(x, y) is true for every pair x, y. The order of operators matters when the quantifiers are of different types, but not when they are of the same type. A variable can be bound or free, with binding occurring within the scope of a quantifier and being unbound otherwise. Logical operations such as negation, disjunction, conjunction, implication, and equivalence can also be applied to quantified statements. For example, "there exists x P(x) and Q(x)" is equivalent to true if there exists an x for which both P(x) and Q(x) are true. The lecture discusses the importance of understanding nested quantifiers and their applications in predicate logic.

## Week 8

### De Morgan's laws for quantifiers Video• . Duration: 6 minutes 6 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

De Morgan's laws for quantifiers are rules used to negate quantified expressions in predicate logic. The laws state that the negation of "for all x, P(x)" is equivalent to "there exists an x such that not P(x)", and the negation of "there exists an x such that P(x)" is equivalent to "for all x, not P(x)". These laws provide a formal way to express intuitions about quantified expressions. The laws can be applied when negating nested quantifiers by moving the negation through each quantifier. For example, if we have the statement "for all x, there exists y such that for all z, p(x,y,z)", its negation is equivalent to "there exists x such that for all y, not (there exists z, p(x,y,z))". This law can be used to derive rules of inference in predicate logic. De Morgan's laws are essential tools for working with quantified expressions and have numerous applications in mathematics and computer science.

Note: I did not include the information about links, formulae, or technical details as they were not specified in the original text, but rather preserved the most important concepts and findings.

### Rules of inference with quantifiers Video• . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

The lecture discusses rules of inference with quantifiers, which are used to reason about statements that involve variables and predicates. The first rule of inference is universal instantiation, which removes the universal quantifier from a statement. For example, if all computer science students study discrete mathematics, then John who is a computer science student studies discrete mathematics. The second rule of inference is universal generalization, which introduces the universal quantifier into a statement. For instance, let DS be the domain of all data science students, and c be an arbitrary element in DS. If c studies machine learning, then for all x, that is an element of DS, x studies machine learning given that the premise P of c is true.

The lecture also covers existential instantiation, which removes the existential quantifier from a statement. For example, let DS be the domain of all data science students, and there exists a student of Data Science who uses Python Pandas library. We can conclude that the students c exists and is using, Python Pandas library. The lecture then discusses existential generalization, which introduces the existential quantifier into a statement.

Universal modus ponens is another rule of inference, which combines universal instantiation and modus ponens. It states that if for all x in the domain, P of x implies Q of x, and if P of a is true for some elements of the domain, then we can conclude that Q of a is also true. Universal modus tollens is another rule of inference, which combines universal instantiation and modus tollens.

The lecture concludes by discussing how to formalize statements in natural language using quantifiers and logical operators. For example, the statement "every student has taken a course in machine learning" can be expressed as for all x, M of x, where M of x is the predicate that x has taken a course in machine learning.

The lecture also covers practice assignments and reading materials, including De Morgan's laws for quantifiers, rules of inference, and predicate logic.

### Rules of inference Reading• . Duration: 15 minutes 15 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

Rules of inference are fundamental logical principles that outline valid ways to derive conclusions from premises. Modus Ponens states that if P→Q and P are true, then Q is true (P→Q ∴ Q). Modus Tollens states that if P→Q and ¬Q are true, then ¬P is true (P→Q ∴ ¬P). Hypothetical Syllogism states that if P→Q and Q→R are true, then P→R is true (P→Q ∴ R). Disjunctive Syllogism states that if P∨Q and ¬P are true, then Q is true (P∨Q ∴ Q). Conjunction states that if P and Q are both true, then P∧Q is true (P ∧ Q). Simplification states that if P∧Q is true, then P is true (P ∧ Q ∴ P). Addition states that if P is true, then P∨Q is true (P ∨ Q).

### Introduction to Boolean algebra Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and details:

Boolean algebra has its roots in Aristotle's work on logic, dating back to 384-322 BC. In 1854, George Boole published an investigation of logical laws that developed a system of logical algebra for expressing reasoning mathematically. Later, Huntington defined the six rules or postulates of Boolean algebra in 1904, and Claude Shannon further investigated its application in analyzing relay switching circuits in his 1938 thesis. Today, Boolean algebra is the foundation of computer circuit analysis and is used to design transistors, which are essential components in building processors. The most well-known form of Boolean algebra is Two-valued Boolean algebra, where variables can only have values of zero or one. This system uses operators such as + (or) and · (and), with the first representing logical conjunction and the second representing logical product. The three fundamental operations in Boolean algebra are: (1) logical product (conjunction), represented by the AND operator; (2) logical sum (disjunction), represented by the OR operator (+); and (3) logic complement (NOT operator), which can be represented as x' (not x).

### Postulates of Boolean algebra Video• . Duration: 8 minutes 8 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and concepts:

Boolean algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with logical operations. The six axioms of Huntington's postulates are fundamental to Boolean algebra, which include closure, identity, commutativity, complements, distributive laws, and associativity. These axioms can be used to deduce other rules and theorems in Boolean algebra, such as De Morgan's laws and the principle of duality. De Morgan's laws state that the complement of a product is equal to the sum of the complements, and the complement of a sum is equal to the product of the complements. The principle of duality states that every theorem in Boolean algebra remains valid if we interchange all ANDs and ORs and interchange all zeros and ones. There are four ways to prove the equivalence of Boolean relations: perfect induction, axiomatic proof, duality principle, and contradiction. The absorption rule can be proved using a true table or directly from existing rules. Understanding these concepts is essential for analyzing and designing electronic circuits, as well as working with logical operations in computer science and other fields.

### Boolean functions Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

A Boolean function defines a mapping from one or multiple Boolean input values to a Boolean output value. For n Boolean input values, there are 2^n possible combinations, which can be represented using a truth table. A Boolean function can be expressed in various ways, including algebraic form, where it can be represented as a sum of products (SOP) or product of sums (POS) formula. The SOP form is preferred for its simplicity and ease of use. To convert a Boolean function to SOP form, identify the values of input variables that result in an output of 1, then create terms with these inputs. If an input variable equals 0, it appears complemented in the expression; if it equals 1, it remains uncomplemented. Two useful Boolean functions are the exclusive or (XOR) function and the implies function (→). The XOR function is represented as x ⊕ y = xy' + x'y, while the implies function is represented as x → y = x' + y.

### Postulates of Boolean algebra Reading• . Duration: 15 minutes 15 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

Boolean algebra is a mathematical structure that captures the essentials of logic operations and set operations, serving as a foundation for designing and analyzing digital circuits and computer algorithms. The primary postulates of Boolean algebra include closure with respect to binary operations, identity, complement, commutativity, associativity, distributivity, absorption, idempotent law, De Morgan's laws, and additional postulates. Closure means that the set {0,1} is closed under addition (OR) and multiplication (AND), ensuring that the results of these operations are always within the set {0,1}. Identity states that a + 0 = a and a * 1 = a for all elements in the set {0,1}, indicating that the identity element for both OR and AND is present. Complement states that every element has a complement (i.e., a' is the inverse of a), which is essential for representing negation and exclusive operations. These postulates provide a formal framework for manipulating logical expressions and digital circuits using addition for OR and multiplication for AND, making them fundamental to computer science, digital logic design, and binary decision processes. Boolean algebra has numerous applications in various fields, including digital circuit design, computer programming, and signal processing. The postulates of Boolean algebra are essential for understanding the principles behind logical operations and digital circuits, enabling the design of efficient algorithms and digital systems.

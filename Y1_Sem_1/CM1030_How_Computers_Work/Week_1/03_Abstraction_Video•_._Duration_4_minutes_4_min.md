Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, focusing on the most important concepts and findings:

A computer's workings are inherently complex due to the involvement of quantum mechanics in semiconductor chips. The number of mathematical operations on a computer can be measured in gigahertz (billion operations per second) and stored in gigabytes (billions of numbers). Due to this complexity, no one can fully understand how a computer works. To address this limitation, the concept of abstraction is introduced. Abstraction refers to simplifying complex information by focusing on key features rather than detailed representations.

In art, abstraction can be seen in works that emphasize certain aspects over realistic details. In engineering, abstract diagrams are used to simplify complex mechanisms, making them easier to understand. The goal of abstraction in computer science is to distill complex computer operations and data into a more manageable form.

However, abstraction does not mean losing accuracy; rather, it involves choosing which features to highlight while simplifying others. This process allows humans to grasp the essential aspects of a system without getting overwhelmed by excessive detail. To facilitate this understanding, computer scientists use abstraction as a fundamental concept in computing.

Abstraction is essential for explaining how computers operate, especially when discussing quantum mechanics and complex hardware components like CPUs and memory. By simplifying these topics through abstraction, researchers can make complex ideas more accessible to a broader audience.

## VIDEO TRANSCRIPT ## You may navigate through the transcript using tab. To save a note for a section of text press CTRL + S. To expand your selection you may use CTRL + arrow key. You may contract your selection using shift + CTRL + arrow key. For screen readers that are incompatible with using arrow keys for shortcuts, you can replace them with the H J K L keys. Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key Notional machines are mostly to help you understand specific applications or pieces of software. But it might be good to start with a notional machine of a computer as a whole. A computer is made up of a lot of different microchips. But the most important one is the central processing unit, or CPU. This is the chip that does all the calculations of a computer. It runs instructions that make up computer programs, what we call code. More than anything else, it's the core of the computer. There is another set of chips that's also vitally important to what a computer does. They are the memory of the computer, often called random access memory, or RAM. The RAM is where the computer stores all the data that it's working on. If you're editing a document, it will be stored in RAM, if you're watching a video, it will pass through RAM before it goes to the screen. The way a computer works can be thought of as an interaction between the CPU and memory. Data is sent from the memory to the CPU, which does some processing on it and then writes data back to memory. Let's look at some example of editing a document in a word processor. Unless the document's huge, it will all be stored in memory. But for most of the time, most of the document will just sit there. As you edit a particular sentence, it will be loaded into the CPU. New letters will be added to it or possibly be deleted, and it will be written back to the document in memory. Of course, a computer isn't just memory and CPU. There are lots of other devices, like a screen, a keyboard, a hard disk, a sound card and speaker. You can't really understand the word processor without understanding how these devices work with CPU and memory. When I first lay the document into my word processor, it will transfer the document from hard disk to RAM. It will then select the part of the document that will be viewed, this will be processed on the CPU to turn it into an image that will be just laid on the screen. When I type on the keyboard, the characters will be sent to the CPU via memory, and the CPU will load the relevant data from the document. The key strokes and the document date will be combined and then written back to memory. When I save my document, it will be written back to the hard disk. Let's look at another example, an audio player. This is much simpler because it doesn't involve changing the data by editing, just playing it. Each time a new song is started, it's loaded from hard disk into memory. Some of the data will be read from memory to the CPU and possibly processed, and then sent out to the sound card. In fact, most computers now have a feature called direct memory access. Which means that the audio data can be copied from memory to the sound card without going through the CPU, to free up the CPU for other things. So a computer is really about data and memory being processed by CPU. But it's also important to be aware of the other devices, like screens and hard disks. This notional machine is a massive simplification of how a real computer works. But it's enough to help us understand a lot of situations. Notional machines can be very useful precisely because they're simple and easy to understand. They help you get a grip on complex processes that would otherwise be incomprehensible. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 1.0 Introduction Lesson 1.1 Abstraction Video: Video Abstraction .

(1) Abstraction - Lecture summary This lecture addresses the complexity of understanding how computers work and introduces the concept of abstraction as a crucial tool in computer science. It explains that while fully comprehending a computer's operations is impossible due to the sheer volume of data and operations involved, abstraction allows us to simplify and focus on key features, making complex systems more understandable. The lecture uses analogies from art to illustrate the concept of abstraction. Key concepts and examples Complexity of computer systems Description: Computer systems are incredibly complex, involving billions of operations and pieces of data that are difficult for any one person to fully understand. Example: A modern web page running within a browser on an operating system involves numerous operations and interactions that are challenging to grasp in their entirety. Quantum operations and CPU Description: The fundamental operations within a computer's CPU involve complex quantum phenomena, adding another layer of difficulty in understanding how computers work. Example: The CPU performs billions of mathematical operations per second, measured in gigahertz. Role of abstraction Description: Abstraction is a key concept in computer science that helps simplify complex systems by focusing on essential features and ignoring intricate details. Example: Abstract art simplifies real-world objects to emphasise key features, similar to how abstraction in computer science simplifies complex operations. Analogies from art Description: The lecture uses art to illustrate abstraction. Realistic art represents detailed reality, while abstract art simplifies and emphasises key features. Example: Johannes Vermeer's realistic painting versus Amedeo Modigliani's abstract painting to explain different levels of detail and focus. Engineering drawings Description: Simplified diagrams in engineering, similar to abstract art, help in understanding complex mechanisms by highlighting important features. Example: Simplified engine diagrams make it easier to understand the mechanism without getting lost in details.

The lecture uses the example of a video to illustrate different layers of abstraction and emphasises the importance of abstraction in understanding and working with computers. It highlights that while abstraction may not capture all complexities, it provides a useful and simpler way to approach and understand various aspects of computing. Key concepts and examples Abstraction in computer science Description: Abstraction is a method of simplifying complex systems by focusing on key details and ignoring less critical aspects. It provides a way to represent data and processes in a more understandable form. Example: A video can be represented in various forms—electrical charges, magnetisation on a hard disk, pulses of light in optic fibres, or electromagnetic waves—but abstraction allows us to think of it simply as a sequence of images. Layers of abstraction Description: Abstraction can be layered, with each layer providing a simpler and more abstract representation of the underlying complexity. Example: A video can be abstracted as numbers, then as pixels and colours, and finally as a sequence of images. Representation of colours and pixels Description: Colours on computer screens are made by mixing red, green and blue light. Each pixel in an image is represented by three numbers indicating the intensity of these primary colours. Example: A pixel’s colour can be represented by the numbers for red, green and blue components, forming a grid that makes up an image. Usefulness of different abstractions Description: Different layers of abstraction are useful for different tasks. The choice of abstraction depends on the specific requirements of a task. Example: Special effects designers need to think about pixels, while network protocol designers need to think about numbers and light pulses. Simplification and utility Description: Abstraction simplifies understanding by providing a more manageable version of complex systems. It is a key tool in computer science for making complex concepts accessible and useful. Example: While the detailed physical differences of how a video is represented are complex, thinking of it as a sequence of images is simpler and usually sufficient for purposes like playing the video.

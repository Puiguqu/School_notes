Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

1. Operating systems have a crucial role in protecting data from unauthorized access.
2. The most basic security function provided by an operating system is a login, which ensures that only authorized users can access the computer.
3. However, with multiple users sharing a computer, it's essential to restrict what each user can do, such as accessing other people's files.
4. To achieve this, there are two levels of access: ordinary users and administrators (also known as superusers or root users).
5. Ordinary users have limited rights, including the ability to use applications and change personal data, but not access other users' files or make changes to the computer.
6. Administrators, on the other hand, have complete control over the computer, including installing applications, adding new users, and deleting user accounts.
7. The operating system uses a concept called memory management to prevent one application from accessing the memory space of another.
8. To achieve this, the operating system has two levels of machine instructions: Privileged Instructions and regular instructions.
9. Privileged Instructions are restricted to privileged code, such as the kernel of the operating system, and can only be executed by authorized processes.
10. Regular instructions, on the other hand, can be executed by any process and do not have access to privileged memory areas.
11. The CPU's hardware enforces these privilege levels, preventing unauthorized code from accessing privileged instructions.
12. Security in operating systems is built into both the software (operating system) and hardware (CPU).
13. Understanding how operating systems secure data and prevent unauthorized access is essential for managing computers and networks.
14. Malware protection is a critical aspect of operating system security, and users must be aware of the risks and take steps to protect themselves.
15. The lesson discusses the importance of operating system security and provides resources for further learning, including videos, readings, and practice assignments.

Note: I've kept the key concepts and technical details, but summarized the text in a way that's easy to understand. If you'd like me to elaborate on any specific point, feel free to ask!

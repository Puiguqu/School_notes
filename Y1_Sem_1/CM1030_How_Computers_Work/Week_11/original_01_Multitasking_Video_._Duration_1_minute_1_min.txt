You might be streaming music while you're waiting for your email to download and reading a web page at the same time. All of this could be happening while your computer is running a virus scan and backing up your data to the cloud. So, computers are pretty busy and they have to handle all these different types of software that are running simultaneously. I don't know about you, but I'm actually pretty bad at multitasking. I really work best when I can focus on just one thing. It might surprise you given what I've just said, but computers are in many ways the same.

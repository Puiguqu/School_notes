We live in a very networked world. We're constantly connecting with people and information over computer networks. We have networks in our offices and our homes. We have mobile phone networks in our cities and across the countryside. We connect to networks with computers, mobile phones and even household devices like heating thermostats and the light bulbs. We rarely use a computer or phone today without being connected to a network in some way, and all of these networks connected together to make the internet, which allows us to connect to information and people across the world, and which has changed the way we live, work and socialize in a very short time. Most of the time we don't think much about how the networks work. How are the devices connected together? How do they communicate? How's it possible to send messages across the world? And how can we keep our information safe if our computers and devices are connected to every other device in the world including those of criminals? These are some of the questions we'll try to answer in this topic. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 13.0 Introduction Video: Video Introduction to Networks .

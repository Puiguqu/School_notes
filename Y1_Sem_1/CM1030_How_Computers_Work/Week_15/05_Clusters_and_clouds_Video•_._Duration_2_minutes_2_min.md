Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

A modern web server is often implemented as a cluster, consisting of multiple computers working together to serve a single website. Each computer in the cluster can have different functions, such as routing or database management, sharing tasks with other computers. Virtual servers are software-based servers that can run on a single computer, allowing multiple websites to be hosted on a single machine. There are two ways to implement virtual servers: virtual machines and containers.

Virtual machines implement the machine language of another computer in software, creating an independent computer with its own operating system and application software. Containers share the same operating system kernel as other containers but act like different computers with different application software. Virtual machines can be more efficient than containers if they use the same machine language.

Most websites are now hosted on Cloud services such as Amazon Web Services or Google Cloud, which use clusters and virtual servers to serve multiple websites. These cloud servers consist of huge clusters of computers, each website having one or more virtual servers implemented on a cluster. The web is an essential part of our lives, and its implementation efficiency is crucial.

Complex architectures for web servers are needed to support the high demand for online services. This lecture has only scratched the surface of how modern websites work, but future lessons will delve deeper into this topic. Key concepts include clusters, virtual servers, containers, and cloud computing.

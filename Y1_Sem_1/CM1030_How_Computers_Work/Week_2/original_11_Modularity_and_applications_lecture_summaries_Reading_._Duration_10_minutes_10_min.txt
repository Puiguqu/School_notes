(1) A notional machine: Files – Lecture summary This lecture explores the concept of files as an abstraction of data within a computer system. It delves into how files are managed by the operating system, including the role of metadata, file states and the mechanisms in place to prevent data corruption and manage file access. The lecture also discusses the importance of understanding file states and metadata to better grasp how operating systems and applications interact with files. Key concepts and examples Files as abstractions Description: Files are abstractions of data, presented by the operating system in a way that makes them easier to understand and manage. Example: A text document or a picture file is an abstraction of the raw data stored as patterns on the disk. Metadata Description: Metadata is data about data, used by the operating system to manage files without dealing with their content. Example: Metadata includes information like file creation date, ownership and whether the file is locked. File permissions Description: Operating systems use a permission system to control access to files, ensuring that only authorised users can open, edit or delete them. Example: A shared computer system where users cannot access each other's files without permission. File locking Description: Locking mechanisms prevent multiple applications from modifying a file simultaneously, which could lead to data corruption. Example: When an application opens a file, it locks it to prevent other applications from making changes until it is closed and unlocked. File states Description: Files go through various states during their lifecycle, from being idle on the disk to being edited in memory and saved back to the disk. Example: A file can be in a closed, unlocked state on the disk while its copy is being edited in memory. Automatic backups and data recovery Description: Modern applications often save automatic backups to prevent data loss in case of a crash. Example: Word processors that periodically save your work to ensure changes are not lost if the application crashes. Handling concurrent edits Description: Applications check for changes in the file's metadata to detect if another application has made modifications, preventing data loss or conflicts. Example: A file-sharing service like Dropbox can result in multiple users editing the same file, potentially causing conflicts.

Modularity involves breaking down complex systems into smaller, manageable chunks called modules. This principle is applied to both hardware and software, making it easier to develop, manage and understand complex systems. The lecture highlights how modularity is crucial for software development and understanding, using drivers as an example of software modules. Key Concepts and examples Modularity in computer systems Description: Modularity involves creating systems composed of simple, interacting modules. This approach helps in managing complexity by breaking down large systems into smaller, more manageable parts. Example: A computer system is modular, consisting of components like the CPU, memory, hard disks and displays. Importance of modularity in software Description: Modularity is even more crucial for software development. Developers use existing modules from the operating system, open-source software, or other developers to build complex software. Example: Software is often split into modules to make it easier to manage and develop. Drivers as software modules Description: Drivers are software modules that control hardware. They allow different hardware components to interact with applications in a standardised way. Example: Printer drivers enable applications to print documents without needing to know the specifics of each printer model. Advantages of modularity Description: Modularity simplifies software development and understanding. It reduces the workload for developers and ensures consistency across different hardware and software components. Example: Application developers write code to interact with drivers, while hardware developers create drivers for their devices, ensuring seamless integration. Understanding software through modularity Description: Knowing the modules that make up a piece of software helps in developing a good notional machine, aiding in the understanding of software. Example: Learning about the different components and how they interact can provide a clearer picture of how software functions.

Applications – Lecture summary This lecture delves into the nature of applications, explaining what they are and how they function. It covers the basic components that make up an application, including executable code, operating system services, libraries and resource files. The lecture also highlights the complexity of modern applications and the importance of understanding these components to grasp how applications work. Key concepts and examples Applications and their interactions Description: Applications, whether termed as apps or software, are what users interact with on devices like computers, smartphones and tablets. These include word processors, music players, web browsers, video games, and photo editors. Example: A word processor like Microsoft Word is an application used to edit text documents. Basic model of applications Description: At its simplest, an application consists of an executable file that contains code and a document file that contains data. The executable file is loaded into memory and performs instructions on the data in the document file. Example: A text document edited by a word processor is stored as a file in memory, and the word processor's code acts on this file. Role of code and executable files Description: Code, which is made up of instructions for the CPU, is stored as bits in memory and can be easily downloaded and run as executable files. Example: An executable file like “.exe” on Windows is a file that contains the code necessary to run an application. Interaction with hardware and operating system Description: Applications interact with hardware through drivers, which are pieces of software that manage hardware interactions. The operating system provides services to applications such as file management, network interaction, and screen rendering. Example: A printer driver allows a word processor to print documents without needing to manage the hardware details of the printer. Use of libraries in applications Description: Applications often use standard software modules or libraries to add functionality. These can be part of the executable file or separate dynamic libraries. Example: A DLL (Dynamic Link Library) file on Windows is a type of dynamic library that can be used by multiple applications for functions like displaying user interfaces. Resource files Description: Applications include resource files that contain data such as user interface text, icons and settings. These files are separate from the executable code and help localise the application or customise user preferences. Example: Changing the language of an application by modifying a text file that contains all the user interface text.

Everything from how computer hardware was able to execute programs, to how the Internet allows you to access web pages. Right up to the latest cutting edge machine learning technologies. You've also learned how to apply this knowledge to the computer systems all around you, from mobile apps to global websites. This knowledge will provide a firm foundation for the rest of your studies and career in computer science. It's the basic general knowledge that any computer scientist should have. It's something you will build on as you go deeper and learn more in the rest of your degree. There is one last thing left for you to do, the exam. I know that a lot of people get nervous about exams and for good reasons. But I want to say that if you've done this course, study the materials, and done the exercises, you will be ready. There are no tricks in the exam, all of the questions will be based on the activities you've done throughout the course. The exact questions will be different, but the style of task will be similar. Every week, you'll have been doing multiple choice quizzes, and a large part of the example with multiple choice questions of this sort. Just like the questions in the course, some will be easy testing basic knowledge and others will make you think a bit more. But none of them will be different in style from the ones you did in the course. You've also been doing a lot of peer reviews and discussions, in which you've applied your ideas to particular computing systems. You've taken the concepts we've learned and seen how they're used by a particular application or website. The exam will feature long answer written questions that follow exactly the same pattern as the peer reviews. The marking scheme will use the same rubrics that you've been using for your peer reviews. So, you should be aware of what we're looking for. Although we have found that other students tend to mark a bit more generously than we do. So, you might need to work a little bit harder for a particular mark. There will also be some more factual long answer questions asking things like, how does the TCP protocol work or what is the difference between lossy and lossless compression? More recently, you've had some practice at these questions as well. Some questions in the exam will be quite hard. It won't be easy to get a hundred percent. It is designed, so that there are questions that will really push you. But this doesn't mean that getting a good mark is impossible. We've designed our exams, so the passing should be easy if you know the material. Getting a good grade should be fine if you practice all the exercises in this course. So, how should you prepare for the exam? Watching the videos and reading the textbook can help. But it's easy to read and think you've understood without getting all the details right. The best way to revise is to practice and test yourself. Go back and try the quizzes again. We've provided ungraded versions of the quizzes, some extra quizzes for you to practice with. Make up your own quiz questions to test yourself on, or use the practice questions in the textbook. A lot of the peer review exercises and discussions asked you to apply your knowledge to a particular application or website. Try doing the exercise again, but with a different application. See if you'd answer some of the early exercises differently with your new knowledge. The important thing is that you test yourself rather than just reading and watching. If you're feeling nervous about the exam, remember that we accepted you onto this degree, which means that we believe you can succeed at it. This course contains everything you need to pass and do well at the exam. So, you should be ready for it. I won't say good luck, because I don't think you need luck. I will just say keep on practicing and I believe you can do it. I hope you've enjoyed this course and found it useful. Maybe you'll spend a lot of your career working with networks, operating systems, data, or machine learning. Or maybe you'll move on to other things. But some of these ideas will crop up once in a while. Either way, there's a lot of exciting stuff still to learn in computer science. Carry on your studies, work hard, and I believe you'll have a great career as a computer scientist. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Video: Video Course summary .

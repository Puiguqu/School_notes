By mastering these key concepts, skills, and knowledge areas, you should be well-prepared for the final exam in the 'How Computers Work' course. 1. Data representation and transmission Bit patterns: Understanding how text and other data types are represented in binary form. Compression techniques: Lossy compression: Know how it reduces file size by removing some data, resulting in the loss of small details. Lossless compression: Understand how it reduces file size without losing any data. Memory types: Registers: Familiarity with small, fast storage locations within the CPU. RAM (Random Access Memory): Understand its role as the main memory for temporary data storage. Hard disks: Recognise their function as long-term storage devices. Machine instructions: Comprehend various machine instructions and their purposes, such as LOAD and STORE. 2. Computer architecture and hardware CPU Components: Arithmetic logic unit (ALU): Know its role in performing arithmetic and logical operations. Control unit: Understand how it directs the operation of the processor. Registers: Comprehend their function as small, fast storage locations within the CPU. Memory hierarchy: Registers: Closest to the CPU, very fast. Cache: Small, fast memory near the CPU. RAM: Larger, slower than cache, used for temporary storage. Hard disks: Used for long-term storage, much slower. File formats: Uncompressed: Recognise formats with no data compression (e.g., BMP). Lossless compressed: Understand formats where data is compressed without loss (e.g., PNG). Lossy compressed: Know formats where data is compressed with some quality loss (e.g., JPEG). 3. Networking and communication IP Addresses: Understand their role in identifying devices on a network. Network protocols: Application layer: Interfaces with the end user (e.g., HTTP). Transport layer: Ensures complete data transfer (e.g., TCP). Network layer: Routes data packets (e.g., IP). Link layer: Handles physical data transfer (e.g., Ethernet). Network types: PAN (Personal area network): Used for small, personal area networks (e.g., Bluetooth). LAN (Local area network): Covers limited areas like offices (e.g., Ethernet, Wi-Fi). WAN (Wide area network): Covers large geographical areas (e.g., the internet). Web server components: Recognise the role of databases and other elements in web servers. 4. Machine learning and algorithms Machine learning classification: Understand that it outputs one of several predefined categories. Machine learning project steps: Data collection: Gathering relevant data. Feature extraction: Identifying important data attributes. Model training: Teaching the model using training data. Model evaluation: Assessing the model's performance. Run-length encoding: Familiarity with this simple compression algorithm. 5. Software and operating systems Operating system components: System utilities: Software that performs system maintenance tasks. Memory manager: Manages memory allocation and deallocation. Kernel: The core part of the operating system that manages system resources. Process scheduler: Manages the execution of processes. Security threats: Viruses: Malicious software that replicates and spreads. Phishing: Fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information. DDoS Attacks: Overloading a system with traffic to disrupt services. Semaphores: Tools used for synchronisation to control access to shared resources in concurrent programming. 6. Practical applications and real-world scenarios GPS navigation: Understand how satellite signals, maps, and algorithms determine the best route. Online shopping: Familiarity with the components involved, such as web servers, databases, payment systems, and logistics. Face recognition: Know how machine learning algorithms detect and identify faces in photos. Taking quizzes on platforms: Understand the behind-the-scenes processes, like data transfer and storage. Video game controllers: Know the process between input from a joystick and the resulting action on screen. 7. Other key concepts ASCII and Unicode: Understand these character encoding standards and how they work. System bus: Know its purpose and function in a computer system. Deadlock: Understand what causes deadlock and how it can be resolved. URL Components: Familiarity with different parts of a URL and their roles in networking and web servers.

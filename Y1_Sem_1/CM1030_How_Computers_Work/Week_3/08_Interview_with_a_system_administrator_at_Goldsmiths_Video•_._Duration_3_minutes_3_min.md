Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

The Department of Computing at Goldsmiths University has set up a lab with Apple iMacs running Mac OS and Windows. The machines are used by students, staff, and visitors, but only those with a Goldsmiths user account can log in. To restrict access to the computers, Goldsmiths uses centrally managed user accounts, which ensures that only authorized individuals can use the labs. The department also advises students to save their work on network storage drives, which are secured and accessible only to individual users.

To prevent data corruption between users, each student has a personal network storage drive mounted when they log in. If a student saves files locally on one of the machines, only that user's data is accessible to others who load onto the same machine. The department also has an administrator account for managing software and settings remotely using remote tools.

The administrator account allows the IT team to manage the computers, software, and settings, which is essential for maintaining security and control over the lab machines. The use of centrally managed user accounts and local admin accounts ensures that only authorized individuals can access and modify data on the machines. By taking these measures, the department minimizes the risk of unauthorized access or data corruption.

The lab machines are used by students for teaching purposes, but also for short courses and other activities within Goldsmiths. The IT team at Goldsmiths is responsible for managing the security of the computers and ensuring that only authorized individuals have access to them.

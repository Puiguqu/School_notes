## VIDEO TRANSCRIPT ## You may navigate through the transcript using tab. To save a note for a section of text press CTRL + S. To expand your selection you may use CTRL + arrow key. You may contract your selection using shift + CTRL + arrow key. For screen readers that are incompatible with using arrow keys for shortcuts, you can replace them with the H J K L keys. Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key As we said earlier, the way the Internet works is that, any message you send is forwarded through a number of routers between your computer and the messages destination. This is what allows the Internet span the globe, and allows people to easily add new networks and computers to it. But it does have one big drawback, any message you send will be passed through many computers that you don't control or even know about. Any of those computers could read your message and reveal its contents to people you don't want to know about it. Many of our communications on the Internet are meant to be private, and we don't want other people reading them. This can be personal emails, but it could also be online interactions with our banks, which could enable people to steal our money, if they were able to intercept them. So, how can we be safe online if other computers can read our messages? The answer is, encryption. Encryption means sending messages in codes so that they can only be read by the person who's supposed to receive them. That means we send the message in a special language or code that can't be read unless you know the code. In ordinary English, we normally use the word "code" for this secret language. But when I'm talking about computers, I'll use the technical term encryption, particularly because in computer science we normally use the word codes to mean the instructions that make up software. Encryption isn't new. The Roman Emperor Julius Caesar would send secret messages in a special codes. He take each letter of the message and replace it with the letter three places along in the alphabet. So, A becomes D, B becomes E, and C becomes F. So the message, "I am the emperor," ends up looking something like this. His successor, Emperor Augustus used the same method, but move the letters one place instead of three. This is a very simple code that can be cracked in a matter of milliseconds by modern computer, but it demonstrates the principles of how encryption works. Modern internet communications use much more sophisticated encryption algorithms, but they still take some normal text and convert it into something that looks unreadable. The encryption process has two elements, one is the algorithm itself. An encryption algorithm is a series of mathematical operations that converts text into another form. In the case of Caesar's code, the algorithm is the idea of shifting letters of the alphabet. The second part is something called a key. This is normally a number that controls how the encryption algorithm works. In the case of Caesar's code, the key is the number of spaces you move, the number three for three spaces. Importantly, you can use the same algorithm with a different key. Emperor Augustus used the same algorithm, but with a one as a key instead of three. A modern computer based encryption method use a long complex and hard to guess number, not something simple like one or three. Modern encryption algorithms are designed so that a message cannot be deciphered, even if you know all the details of the encryption algorithm, as long as you don't know the key. That's great because it means that encryption software can be publicly available but we can still communicate safely if we keep our key secret. In fact, there are some encryption techniques called public key encryption, where different keys are used to encrypt a message and to decrypt it. That means the encryption key can be public and anyone can use it to create an encrypted message, but only people with the decryption key can read those messages. So, my bank can give me the public key and I can encrypt my message to the bank, and be sure that only my bank can read the message. Modern encryption is essentially impossible to crack, even with the world's fastest computers. Does that mean we're completely safe? Unfortunately not, because there are many ways of getting around encryption. One method is to try to fool you into using the wrong key. A criminal might try to convince you to use a particular encryption key when sending your password to the bank, this would be the key that the criminal knows but the bank doesn't. This could happen by a phishing attack, where the criminal sets up a fake server that looks like the bank or by setting up a malicious router that incepts packets that you send to your bank. To defend against this kind of attack, you need some way of validating that you're using the correct key. This is done through certificates, every public key has certificate that demonstrates its validity. The keys and certificates are issued by a number of trusted security companies. Your web browser can check whether the certificate of the key has been issued by someone trustworthy. If it hasn't, that could be a sign that someone is trying to trick you into using the wrong key. Your browser will give you a message saying that the encryption key is not valid or something similar depending on what browser you're using. You should take this warning seriously because although the page will still be encrypted, the encryption could be readable by criminals. So, encryption is the basis of a lot of the defenses we have against security threats, which is what we'll look at next. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 3.0 Introduction Lesson 3.1: Networks Lesson 3.2: Security Video: Video Security threats .

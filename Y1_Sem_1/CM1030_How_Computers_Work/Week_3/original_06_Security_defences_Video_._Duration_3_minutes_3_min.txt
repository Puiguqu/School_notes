Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key There's many ways of protecting against security threats as there are types of threat. Viruses and other malicious software are combated using antivirus software, which includes the information about all known viruses and searches your computer for them. Another good defense for your computer is a firewall, which will stop any suspect looking messages from coming in or out of your computer. That's a good way of preventing people who try to directly hack your computer. One of the most important ways of protecting both personal computers and web servers is access control, where only certain people can have access to a computer or a server. This is normally done by making people log in using a username and password. Often, different people will have access to different aspects of the system. For example, you as a learner, can view the videos of the course and take the quizzes, but you can't change them, see other people's grades, or edit your own grades. Seeing another person's grade would be a breach of privacy, and editing your grades could allow you to cheat. As a teacher, I can edit the course materials and see everyone's grades, but I don't have total access to the system. For example, I can't edit people's grades and I can't change the software running on Coursera's servers. Only the system administrators and software developers can change the software. These restrictions mean that everyone has the ability to do what they need on the server, but that people can't damage it either accidentally or deliberately. All of these access control methods rely on passwords, which are very important. Passwords are always encrypted so no one can read them, but some can be easy to guess. One common hack is to use a computer program to automatically try millions of common passwords. For example, all the words in the dictionary. This is why websites want you choose unusual passwords, and try to get you to do it by asking you to choose a password with lowercase letters, uppercase letters, and numbers. Unfortunately, good passwords are hard to remember. So, people often use ones that are easy to remember like small variations of common words, but these are also easy for programs to guess. That's why a lot of sites are starting to use two-factor authentication, which includes a password, but also requires you to enter a code that the site sends you on your mobile phone. This is a much more secure approach, and I'd recommend using this if you can. So, there are a lot of risks online, but if you're aware of the protection mechanisms that are available, it's possible to keep your information safe. If you learn one thing about computer science, it should be a bit of computer security so that you do not take unnecessary risks. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 3.0 Introduction Lesson 3.1: Networks Lesson 3.2: Security Video: Video Security threats .

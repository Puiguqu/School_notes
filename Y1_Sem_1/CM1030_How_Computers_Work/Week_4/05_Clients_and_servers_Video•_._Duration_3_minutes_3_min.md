Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Websites are modular applications that rely on various components working together. The two primary modules are the client (your computer and web browser) and the server (the website's computer and software running on it). A basic web server consists of one or more web pages, each represented by one or more HTML files. When a request comes in, one page is sent to the client. Modern websites are more complex, with web pages created only when needed in response to specific requests.

Databases are software platforms designed to store data in a structured way that's easy to access for computers. They're efficient for getting data from a database but challenging to add new data. Social media sites store user information, such as name, age, and gender, in databases. The server uses templates with formatting for web pages (e.g., social media profiles) and combines them with data from the database.

The template page contains empty spaces that are filled with data from the database. Webpage formatting is done using HTML and CSS files. Almost everything on a website is a combination of pre-designed templates and dynamically generated content from databases. The interaction between web servers, databases, and browsers demonstrates the modular nature of websites. A server doesn't just store webpages; it creates them using templates and databases.

Understanding these interactions is crucial for becoming a web developer or effectively using websites. Databases make it possible to extend website information without creating new pages. This highlights the importance of modularity in software development, as seen in the complex interactions between web servers, databases, and browsers.

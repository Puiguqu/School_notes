You've worked very hard and you've learned some really fundamental ideas about computer science that will help you understand how computers work. From abstraction and state to applications and networks. You've put all this knowledge to work to understand how websites work. But you haven't just learned about these specific computer systems. You've learned general ideas that will help you understand all computer systems. These first two topics have given you an overview of this whole course. we'll move to some more detailed topics then we'll go into more depth and you'll use some new ways of learning. In the rest of this course, you'll learn more about data, CPUs, applications operating systems, networks and the internet. You'll continue to learn through videos, quizzes, discussions, and peer reviews. But you'll also have free access to world class textbooks and learn through interactive simulations. You'll have support from expert tutors, who'll give you feedback on your major assignments. At the end of the course, you'll find out about some of the most cutting edge topics in computer science, when we talk about machine learning and data science. I'm really looking forward to continuing this journey into computer science with you. But I hope what you've already learned will enrich how you use computers. Go out and work with computers in new ways, with a deeper understanding and a renewed curiosity. You don't have to just use your software. You can also think about how it works. Think about what abstractions and notional machines might help you to understand it. Think about the states modules and protocols that it might use. Computer science isn't just about knowing how to use computers better, it's about making using computers into a more interesting satisfying and fun experience. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 4.1 Web applications Lesson 4.2 Summary Peer-graded Assignment: Notional machine of a web site .

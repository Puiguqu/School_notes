You may contract your selection using shift + CTRL + arrow key. For screen readers that are incompatible with using arrow keys for shortcuts, you can replace them with the H J K L keys. Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key The bits that make up computer representations have to be stored physically somewhere. There are many different technologies used for storing binary data, but I want to make one very important distinction between main memory and mass storage. Main memory is where your computer stores information that it's currently using. Main memory is made up of microchips called Random Access Memory or RAM. Main memory is where your computer stores information that it's currently using. It's where a document lives while you're editing is, and it's where it's storing the video that you're watching right now. Mass storage is where things are stored permanently. It's where your document goes when you save it. Everything in main memory is forgotten when you turn off your computer, but mass storage is saved. Main memory is fast and easy to read and write to, but it does not save data when the power is turned off. Its capacity is relatively small, typically less than a 100 gigabytes at the time the video is recorded. Mass storage is much slower, but it saves data when the power is off. And it can have much higher storage capacity often into the terabytes. Main memory is made up of microchips called Random Access Memory or RAM. What actually happens in a microchip? A microchip is some silicon with some weird quantum stuff going on inside it. But as you can probably guess, I'm not interested in that. Microchips handle bits. As I've said before, bits can represent many different things, and it's important not to think of them as one or zero or true or false or black or white, but we need a way of representing bits in general. So I will use the standard convention of representing a bit as one or zero. Just remember that when I say one, it could also be true or on or locked. I'll also talk about true or false which is a common way of thinking about bits. So, microchips do calculations on bits. Calculations on numbers are based on operations like adding and multiplying. The operations on bits are a bit different. The simplest one is not. It takes a single bit and makes it its opposite. One becomes zero, zero becomes one. True becomes false, black becomes white. More complex operations combined two bits, for example, AND has an output of one if both inputs are one but zero if either input is zero. Or on the other hand, if either input is one and is only zero if they're both zero. In particular, I want to show you this combination of gates. It's called a flip-flop and it does something very clever. When it receives a one on its top input, its output becomes one, and it will remain one even when it's input stops. When it receives a one at the bottom input, its output becomes zero and stays that way until the top input becomes one. That means that this little circuit can store information. This circuit or variants of it is the basis of main memory chips, and you can find out more about it in the textbook. So, main memory is pretty much the same across all computers with only little variations. Mass storage on the other hand is very varied. There are many different types. Your computer probably has a hard disk, a bit like this one, that stores data magnetically. A DVD is optical storage. So, it stores data in a way that can be read with light, in this, case lasers. Flash storage is a microchip that stores data permanently unlike RAM. You may be familiar with USB flash drives like this one, but flash storage can also be used as an alternative to hard disks. These flash-based storage drives are called solid state drives, SSDs for short. Newer computers have these flash drives and your phone will definitely have flash storage. Different types of storage have different capabilities. SSDs are slower than RAM but much faster than hard disk or optical drives. Optical drives are slow to write to, so they're best used for permanent archiving rather than for frequently changing documents that you might have on your hard disk. Size and power consumptions are also becoming important factors particularly with mobile devices, and flash drives can be smaller and use less electrical power than hard disks. To sum up, there are two basic types of storage: main memory, which is fast and useful for making fast calculations or manipulations on anything you're currently working on; and mass storage, which is slow but big and useful for permanent storage. With storage, we're trading off between storage capacity, power usage and speed. In fact, on modern computers, there are many such tradeoffs not just between main memory and mass storage. For example, you might have an SSD drive on your computer that is small but fast, and you would use it to store commonly used files. You might also have a bigger hard disk which you use to store files you use less often. You might also use cloud storage. This is data that is stored not on your own computer but on a computer somewhere on the Internet. You can take advantage of truly massive hard disks and storage that is guaranteed to remain even if your computer fails. But since the data has to be transmitted over the Internet, storing and accessing data in the cloud is much slower than any device on your computer. There are also different types of main memory. Most computers now have small pieces of expensive but very fast memory called a cache. This is often on the same chip as your main processor. So, it can be accessed very quickly. The cache is used for storing data that's being used at this very moment. For example, if you're working on a written report, it might be the sentence that you're typing at this very moment. When you finish a particular sentence, it's saved back to main memory with the rest of your document. So, there is no single best type of storage. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages, and it's very important to understand these when you're building computer systems. Your knowledge of data storage will help you with really practical problems like choosing a new computer but will also help you understand the complex computer systems that run the modern world. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 5.0 Introduction Lesson 5.1 Data storage Discussion Prompt: Storage devices .

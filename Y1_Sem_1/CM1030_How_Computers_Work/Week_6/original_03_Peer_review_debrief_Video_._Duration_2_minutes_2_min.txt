## VIDEO TRANSCRIPT ## You may navigate through the transcript using tab. To save a note for a section of text press CTRL + S. To expand your selection you may use CTRL + arrow key. You may contract your selection using shift + CTRL + arrow key. For screen readers that are incompatible with using arrow keys for shortcuts, you can replace them with the H J K L keys. Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key The number of possible file formats can be a bit confusing. In some cases, they're only due to competition between different software vendors. For example, the word processors Microsoft Word, OpenOffice and Apple pages all have their own formats, which do essentially the same thing. There are also important distinctions between file formats. It's important to understand them so you can use the right format for what you're doing. Many of the different file formats reflect differences in compression. For example,.wav is normally uncompressed audio and.MP3 is compressed. Jpeg, PNG, and gif are all different compression methods for images. Jpeg is optimized for compressing photographs, while gif is better for line art. Another important distinction is that some files are designed to be edited, while others are just designed to be viewed. Adobe Illustrator format is a vector graphics format, which means that it represents images in terms of their shape. This makes it much easier to edit them than a bitmap format like jpeg would be. PDF is a document format that's designed for efficient reading, but not for editing. I often send people documents as PDF because I want them to read them, but not to be able to edit them. The TXT format is an interesting one. It's simply a text file. That means it's a file that only contains ASCII or Unicode text. While a word processing file like Microsoft Word doc file, is also designed to contain text, but also contains lots of other information about formatting and other things. Each of the file formats I've talked about has its uses, its advantages and its disadvantages. Having a good understanding of data representation will help you choose the right file format and use it effectively. I hope that doing this exercise has helped you understand the data formats you use. Something that will set you in good stead for your work as a computer scientist. ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 6.1 Compression Lesson 6.2 Summary Peer-graded Assignment: File formats .

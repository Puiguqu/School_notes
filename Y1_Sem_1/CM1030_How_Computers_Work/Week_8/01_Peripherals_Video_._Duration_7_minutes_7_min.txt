Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

1. A computer consists of a CPU (central processing unit) and memory, but also includes various peripheral devices such as screens, keyboards, hard disks, sound cards, and more.
2. These devices are connected to the CPU and memory via the bus, which is like a central highway for data transfer.
3. The bus allows for communication between the CPU, memory, and peripheral devices, including displays, keyboards, and graphics cards.
4. Each peripheral device has its own controller, which decodes data received from the bus and sends it to the device.
5. Graphics processing units (GPUs) are highly specialized controllers that handle parallel programming and produce high-speed graphics.
6. Universal Serial Bus (USB) is a type of controller used for connecting devices such as hard disks, external sound cards, and keyboards to computers.
7. USB supports multiple devices and allows for independent data transfer between the CPU and devices.
8. Bluetooth is another protocol used for wireless communication between peripheral devices and computers.
9. Devices communicate with the CPU using load instructions, which send signals along the bus to the controller and then to the device.
10. Some machine languages have specialized commands for accessing peripheral devices, while others use memory-mapped IO (input/output) to simplify communication.
11. Memory-mapped IO allows peripherals to be treated as part of the main memory, reducing the number of instructions needed to interact with them.
12. The speed of memory and devices is critical in determining the overall performance of a computer, as accessing peripheral devices can be many times slower than memory or registers.
13. Software can often execute other instructions while waiting for data from memory, but may be blocked if that data is not available.
14. Direct memory access (DMA) enables faster communication between devices and memory by allowing them to communicate directly without CPU intervention.
15. Understanding the interaction between peripheral devices and the CPU is crucial in optimizing computer performance and software functionality.

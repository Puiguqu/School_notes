Here is a summary of the text in 15 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

Virtual reality (VR) is an interactive technology that surrounds users with a virtual world. The headset, which connects to the computer via HDMI cable, provides a display similar to a screen. However, it also has a USB 3.0 connector, allowing for power and data transfer. The headset sends information back to the computer via USB, tracking head movement and sending data about it.

Touch controllers are used to interact with virtual objects in VR space, allowing users to grab and manipulate virtual objects as if they were real. These controllers use Bluetooth protocol to connect to the headset wirelessly, rather than being wired to the computer. The connection is proprietary, ensuring fast communication between the controllers and the headset.

VR places strong demands on speed, requiring immediate updates when turning the head or moving in space. This can cause nausea, known as simulator sickness, if the delay is too long. Computers have made significant progress in processing power, allowing for instantaneous updates to be displayed within 20 milliseconds. 

The graphics processing unit (GPU) handles high-quality computer graphics required for VR, working in a parallel manner to ensure fast rendering. A powerful GPU or graphics card is necessary to unlock virtual reality applications that require rapid communication between devices.

VR relies on new peripheral devices that enable users to interact with computers in novel ways, creating challenges for computer scientists to balance usability, fun, and performance.

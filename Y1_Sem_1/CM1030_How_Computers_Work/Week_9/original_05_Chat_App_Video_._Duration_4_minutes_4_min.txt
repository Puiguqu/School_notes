You may contract your selection using shift + CTRL + arrow key. For screen readers that are incompatible with using arrow keys for shortcuts, you can replace them with the H J K L keys. Some screen readers may require using CTRL in conjunction with the alt key Let's have a look at an example of what an operating system might be doing for a real app. Now, operating systems aren't just on PCs and laptops. Mobile phones also have operating systems, whether it's Android or IOS. So, let's have a look at a phone app. One of the most common and popular types of app is a chat app that allows you to send messages in real-time to friends all over the world. There are a lot of different chat apps. You might be in Chinese in WeChat, in India using Hi, or in Europe is whatsapp alone. Those are just a small number of the chat apps that are available. In many places, chat apps are massively important part of how we interact with computers. They aren't just for communicating with our friends. For example, in Lagos Nigeria, people use a chatbot called Lara to give them directions including local bus services and prices. So, how does a chat app interact with your operating system? Well, the most basic level, the operating system has to provide screen space. It's not quite a window manager like you would have on a desktop operating system because generally, on a mobile phone, you only have one app visible at anytime and you don't have multiple windows. But it does provide the space on your phone screen. Then the GUI will provide some user interface widgets. For example, a title bar and also buttons like a home button and the compose button. A really important feature provided by the operating system is the keyboard. Unlike in a laptop, the keyboard on a mobile phone nowadays tends to be software, not a piece of hardware. The operating system provides the underlying user interface of your software keyboard. There are also some app-specific bits of user interface, which in this case is the actual area where the chats appear. So, that's the graphical user interface part of the app. But what about the kernel? any app, a chat app will need memory. A chunk of memory will be provided by the memory manager. Even though, on a mobile phone it appears if you only ever have one app open a time. Actually, you are likely to have several running in the background and they will all have their chunks in memory. In general, mobile operating systems tend to be a lot more ruthless about when apps are sent to virtual memory on mass storage. In this case, SSD storage rather than hard disk because you don't have hard disks on phone. Firms need to be more careful about memory use and background apps because of power consumption. You can't really have a lot of apps running at the same time because they just use up too much power. So, the operating system tends to suspend a lot of apps and saves their memory area to mass storage. What about other kernel functions? When you're using an app, you're likely to type on the keyboard. Because it's a software keyboard, it won't register a key press. What it registers is a touch to the screen. This is received by the touch screen driver and then fed to the virtual keyboard software, which is a utility. The keyboard software sends the message to the app itself which then calls the GUI library to actually draw the message on screen. The app will also send a message to the network drivers so that the message can be sent off to the service of your chat app and ultimately to the person you're chatting to. Most chat apps let you send photos as well as text. What happens when you receive a photo to the app is that it generally gets saved to permanent storage, which on a phone is normally SSD. The photo will be saved to a file in the file system of your phone. Though it might not have a user interface for browsing files, your phone has a file system behind the scenes just like a PC. File systems organize files into folders. Your chat app is likely to have a folder that contains all the images and other files that were sent to it. In fact, it probably also sends all the chats themselves to a file. Most chat apps also back up their file data to cloud storage so you can access it easily on multiple devices. This will involve an interaction between the file system and the network drivers. So, that's an example of a chat app. Why don't you go away and think about some of the other apps you use, either on computers or phones and see how they might use the various services that your operating system provides? ## END TRANSCRIPT ## ## ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT ## Lesson 9.0 Introduction Lesson 9.1: What is an operating system?

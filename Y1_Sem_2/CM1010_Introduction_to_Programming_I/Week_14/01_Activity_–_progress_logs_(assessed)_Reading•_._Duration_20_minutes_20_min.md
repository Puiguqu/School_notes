Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences:

As your project progresses, it's essential to keep a log of what you've achieved and plan to do next. This will help track your project's progress, allow instructors to see how you approached the topic, and provide evidence of your work. You'll be required to complete a log for each topic in the second half, using the provided template to structure your responses. The log should include: project title, current topic, progress made, problems faced, solutions found, plans for the next few weeks, and whether you're on track to complete the project. If not on target, you'll need to explain how you plan to address the issue. You'll be required to submit all four logs with your final project submission and should keep them safe on your computer. The logs will be compiled into a PDF for submission at the end of the project. You can view the template in rich text format (RTF) or Microsoft Word docx format, and you're advised to convert completed logs to PDF for submission.

Here's a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and details:

The program creates a horde of zombies that cross a canvas. The task is to enhance the code by splitting it into multiple files, each containing a different constructor. Each zombie should have a health property assigned to it. A shovel should be added to the game. When a zombie's head is clicked, its health decreases. If a zombie's health reaches zero, a new zombie should be added to the horde. The ultimate goal of the enhanced program can be made into a game where zombies need to be kept from the right side of the screen for as long as possible. The starter code is provided in a ZIP file.

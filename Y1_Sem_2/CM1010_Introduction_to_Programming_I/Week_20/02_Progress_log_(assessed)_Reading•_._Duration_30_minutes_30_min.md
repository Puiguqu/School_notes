There is no text provided to summarize. The provided text appears to be instructions or guidelines for a student project, specifically regarding keeping a progress log throughout the project. It outlines the template and format required for the log, as well as the importance of submitting it at the end of the project.

If you would like me to help with summarizing actual text, please provide the relevant text, and I will be happy to assist you in condensing the main points into 8 sentences while preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details.

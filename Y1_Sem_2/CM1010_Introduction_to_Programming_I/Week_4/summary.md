This is a transcript of an interview with a student, Evan Griffiths, who completed a project using the p5.js library. The interview covers various aspects of the project, including the changes Evan made to the original template, the model loading feature, and potential improvements for future projects.

The transcript can be broken down into several sections:

1. Introduction and context: Evan introduces himself and explains that he worked on a project using the p5.js library, which is a popular JavaScript library for creating interactive web-based applications.
2. Changes to the original template: Evan discusses the changes he made to the original template, including adding a 3D drawing area, implementing model loading, and improving user interface elements.
3. Model loading feature: Evan explains how he implemented the model loading feature, which allows users to import 3D objects from OBJ files. He also discusses the challenges he faced while working on this feature, such as handling the complexity of the OBJ file format.
4. User interface improvements: Evan highlights several user interface improvements he made, including adding a red highlight box around the selected model and improving the overall layout of the application.
5. Potential improvements for future projects: Evan reflects on potential improvements for future projects, including updating to the latest version of p5.js if necessary and making code changes to improve readability.

Overall, this transcript provides valuable insights into the process of creating an interactive web-based application using p5.js, as well as tips and advice for students working on similar projects.

## Instructions for peer review Reading• . Duration: 15 minutes 15 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/supplement/JnLC6/instructions-for-peer-review)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences:

Peer review is a collaborative process where students, scholars, or researchers evaluate each other's work to provide feedback and learn from one another. In an academic setting, peer reviews may be part of required assignments, where students submit their own work for grading by peers, while also grading a minimum number of peers' submissions to receive their own assignment grade. Peer review is not just about critiquing but also offering constructive feedback that can help authors improve their work and develop critical thinking and analytical skills. Participating in peer review fosters a sense of community, improves writing and research skills, and offers new perspectives and ideas, as well as preparing students for future academic and professional endeavors. Peer review enhances learning and retention by reinforcing knowledge and understanding of subject matter, while also developing empathy and communication skills. By engaging in peer review, students can gain insight into the review process, reduce anxiety about submitting work for review, and increase their competence in navigating academic and professional review processes. Additionally, peer review exposes students to diverse research topics and methodologies, sparking interest in interdisciplinary study or collaboration, and boosting confidence in academic abilities through the improvement of peers' work. Overall, peer review is a valuable process that can enhance critical thinking, analytical skills, and academic success.

## Reflection on interview with the student Reading• . Duration: 30 minutes 30 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/supplement/Unq5J/reflection-on-interview-with-the-student)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

After watching the interview with Evan, students should reflect on their own project's progress and consider how they can incorporate features from Evan's application into their own implementation. This includes redesigning core functionality, such as the color picker and line tool, which Evan built both simple and advanced tools for. Students should plan how to implement more complex p5.js features like 3D graphics by using planning techniques, brainstorming, and iterating different designs. To support this process, students can use various planning methods and assess their current progress regularly to ensure they are on track to meet the deadline and required standard. The midterm assignment will ask students to detail their implementation plan, which they should maximize by keeping a record of brainstorming designs, sketches, sources of inspiration, technical help, and regular logging of progress. Students can upload these materials at the midterm or end-of-term assignments. Evan's interview highlights the importance of self-reflection and documenting one's thinking and progress to improve project outcomes. By following these guidelines, students will be better prepared for their final application submission, where they will reflect on what they would do differently and assess their current progress.

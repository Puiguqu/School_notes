# P5.js sound: amplitude Videoâ€¢ . Duration: 15 minutes 15 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/lecture/zvamN/p5-js-sound-amplitude)

This is a transcript of an audio lecture or tutorial on using the P5.js library to analyze sound and create visualizations. The lecturer discusses various topics related to sound analysis, including:

1. Introduction to sound analysis in P5.js
2. Preparing for case study 2
3. Loading and playing sounds in P5.js
4. Analyzing amplitude (volume) of a sound signal
5. Playing with amplitude and frequency
6. Creating music visualizations using P5.js

The lecturer also mentions some additional resources, including videos and practice assignments, that can be used to learn more about sound analysis and visualization in P5.js.

Some key takeaways from the lecture include:

* How to use P5.js to load and play sounds
* How to analyze the amplitude (volume) of a sound signal using P5.js
* How to create visualizations that respond to changes in amplitude and frequency
* The importance of experimenting with different parameters and techniques to achieve the desired effect

The lecture concludes with some practice assignments and additional resources for further learning.

Note: The transcript appears to be an incomplete or fragmented version of a larger tutorial or lecture. Some sections are missing, and there may be additional content not included in this transcription.

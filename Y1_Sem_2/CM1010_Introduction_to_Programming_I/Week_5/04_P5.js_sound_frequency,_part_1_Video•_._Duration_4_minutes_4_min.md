Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and concepts:

The concept of frequency is an important aspect of sound, where pitch is measured in hertz (Hz). The human hearing range spans from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. Sounds can be either pitched or unpitched, with pitched sounds having a dominant frequency that can be described digitally using frequency spectra. To accurately describe a sound digitally, every possible frequency within the hearing range must be considered and its amplitude measured, resulting in a complex bar chart known as a frequency spectrum. However, this is impractical due to the vast number of frequencies (18,980) involved, so they are grouped into bands for easier analysis. A graphic equalizer display can provide an idea of how these frequency bands shift over time as the sound changes. To analyze sound in p5.js, a rolling frequency spectrum can be created using FFT objects, allowing for a dynamic representation of music tracks. The process involves taking multiple frequency spectra to capture the changing characteristics of the sound over time.

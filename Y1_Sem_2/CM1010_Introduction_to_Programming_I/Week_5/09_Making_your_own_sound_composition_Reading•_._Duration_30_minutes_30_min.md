[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/supplement/DRu7H/making-your-own-sound-composition)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

To complete this sketch, create an `initialized` global variable with a value of `false` initially. When `initialized` is `false`, draw a message on the screen. The loop method's `rate` argument can be altered to explore sound playback effects, including setting a start time (currently set to 0). Use the `map` function and mouse x position to change playback rate when playback starts. Pause sound playback when the space button is pressed by adding a condition to the `keyPressed` function that checks for the space button. To allow for playback restarts, nest a further conditional as Simon shows in the previous video. An anonymous function can be added to the `loadSound` call to stop playback until the file is fully loaded. Explore other sound library methods and search for freely available sounds if needed.

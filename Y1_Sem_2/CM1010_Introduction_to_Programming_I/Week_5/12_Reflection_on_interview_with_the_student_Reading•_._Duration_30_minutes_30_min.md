Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The interview with Taylor has encouraged reflection on progress made so far with the drawing application project. Key takeaways from the interview include potential features to add or redesign, such as controls for the music visualizer and different waveform manipulation techniques. Incorporating camera and microphone functionality into the application is also an idea worth exploring. The midterm assignment will require a detailed implementation plan, which can be maximized with planning techniques and brainstorming to iterate on designs. Regular progress logging, tracking of design sources and inspiration, and technical help are essential aspects to keep track of for assessment purposes. Taylor's experience has taught him what he would do differently in the future, highlighting the importance of reflection on one's project. To prepare for this self-assessment, students should start keeping a record of their thinking, progress, and brainstorming designs. The assignments and assessments will require students to upload these logs as part of their midterm or end-of-term evaluations.

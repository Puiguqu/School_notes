Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and concepts:

The toolkit of data visualizations uses the p5.js library to access and manipulate tabulated data. Data can be either quantitative (e.g., numbers, scales) or qualitative (e.g., text, images). The table object provides methods for accessing and manipulating data, including loading external data from a CSV file. The loadTable command is used with the preload argument to ensure data is ready for use when needed. Methods for accessing rows and columns include getting specific rows by index, searching for values in particular columns, setting and removing rows, and accessing data by column. The getColumn method retrieves an array of values for a particular variable, which may require conversion from strings to numbers. The table object provides many methods for manipulating tabulated data, and users are encouraged to review the documentation to learn more. In the next video, a real code example with a data table will be presented, along with further information on the CSV format used in p5.js.

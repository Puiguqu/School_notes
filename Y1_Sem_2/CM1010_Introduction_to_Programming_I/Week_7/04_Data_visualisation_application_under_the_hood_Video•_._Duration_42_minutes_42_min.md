[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/lecture/Ta3uA/data-visualisation-application-under-the-hood)

This text appears to be a transcript of a lesson or tutorial on a programming topic, specifically on the P5.js library for data visualization. The content seems to follow a structured format, starting with an introduction and then diving into detailed explanations and examples.

The lesson begins by introducing the concept of a data visualization app and the importance of understanding how it works under the hood. It explains that the app uses various visualizations, including pie charts, bar charts, and more, to display data in a meaningful way.

The lesson then guides the reader through a case study of one of these visualizations, "Pay Gap By Job." The author walks the reader through the code step by step, explaining each part of the visualization's implementation. This process is repeated for other visualizations, such as "Tech Diversity Race" and "Climate Change."

The lesson concludes with an introduction to a data visualization application built using P5.js, providing an overview of how it works and encouraging the reader to further explore its code.

Some key concepts covered in this transcript include:

1.  **P5.js library**: A popular JavaScript library for creating interactive, web-based graphics.
2.  **Data visualization**: The process of representing data in a graphical format to aid understanding and interpretation.
3.  **Case study**: An in-depth examination of a particular topic or problem, often used to learn from real-world examples.

Overall, this transcript aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to the P5.js library's capabilities for data visualization, encouraging readers to explore its applications and code structure.

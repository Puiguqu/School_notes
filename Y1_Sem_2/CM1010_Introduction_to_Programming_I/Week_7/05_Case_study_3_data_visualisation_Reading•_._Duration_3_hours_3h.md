Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The goal of this case study is to complete various visualizations using the provided data-vis template. The first task is to complete the visualization defined in tech-diversity-gender.js to create a stacked bar chart representing the proportion of men employed at each company. To do this, one needs to extract relevant data from the raw CSV file, parse it correctly, and use the correct methods to ensure accurate data representation on the plot. The ratio of female:male staff at Indiegogo is 0.5, which should be correctly visualized on the plot.

The next task is to complete the visualization defined in pay-gap-1997-2017.js to create a line graph representing the pay gap between female and male employees over time. This requires extracting relevant data from the raw CSV file, completing the mapPayGapToHeight() method, and using both mapYearToWidth() and mapPayGapToHeight() methods to plot the pay gap over time.

The third task is to complete the visualization defined in climate-change.js to create a line graph with gradient fill background representing the change in Earth's surface temperature. This requires completing the rect() function below the fill() method, using the mapYearToWidth() method, and accessing values within the visualization object.

Finally, tasks are completed for tech-diversity-race.js (pie chart representing racial diversity of prominent tech companies), pay-gap-by-job-2017.js (scatter plot representing difference in pay for men and women across different jobs).

There is no text provided for me to summarize. The provided text appears to be a video transcript and additional page content related to an educational platform, but it does not contain any specific information about data visualization or programming concepts that can be summarized in 8 sentences.

If you could provide the actual text about p5's data tools and the structure of the data visualization app, I would be happy to assist you with summarizing the key information, formulae, links, and technical details.

## Introducing P5 data Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/lecture/meXhl/introducing-p5-data)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and concepts:

The toolkit of data visualizations uses the p5.js library to access and manipulate tabulated data. Data can be either quantitative (e.g., numbers, scales) or qualitative (e.g., text, images). The table object provides methods for accessing and manipulating data, including loading external data from a CSV file. The loadTable command is used with the preload argument to ensure data is ready for use when needed. Methods for accessing rows and columns include getting specific rows by index, searching for values in particular columns, setting and removing rows, and accessing data by column. The getColumn method retrieves an array of values for a particular variable, which may require conversion from strings to numbers. The table object provides many methods for manipulating tabulated data, and users are encouraged to review the documentation to learn more. In the next video, a real code example with a data table will be presented, along with further information on the CSV format used in p5.js.

## Accessing external data Video• . Duration: 30 minutes 30 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/lecture/5WdJy/accessing-external-data)

This is a transcript of a video lesson on using P5.js, a JavaScript library for creating interactive graphics and data visualization. The lesson covers several topics:

1. Introduction to P5.js and its capabilities
2. Loading and manipulating external data using the `table` object
3. Creating a scatterplot using the `scatterplot` constructor
4. Adding a line of best fit to the scatterplot

The transcript includes code examples and explanations, as well as suggestions for practice assignments.

Some key takeaways from the lesson include:

* The importance of parsing data to ensure it is used correctly in calculations
* The flexibility of P5.js in allowing developers to create custom visualizations
* The benefits of using a library like P5.js to simplify data visualization tasks

Overall, this transcript provides a comprehensive overview of how to use P5.js for data visualization, including loading and manipulating data, creating scatterplots, and adding lines of best fit.

## Data visualisation application: under the hood Video• . Duration: 42 minutes 42 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/lecture/Ta3uA/data-visualisation-application-under-the-hood)

This text appears to be a transcript of a lesson or tutorial on a programming topic, specifically on the P5.js library for data visualization. The content seems to follow a structured format, starting with an introduction and then diving into detailed explanations and examples.

The lesson begins by introducing the concept of a data visualization app and the importance of understanding how it works under the hood. It explains that the app uses various visualizations, including pie charts, bar charts, and more, to display data in a meaningful way.

The lesson then guides the reader through a case study of one of these visualizations, "Pay Gap By Job." The author walks the reader through the code step by step, explaining each part of the visualization's implementation. This process is repeated for other visualizations, such as "Tech Diversity Race" and "Climate Change."

The lesson concludes with an introduction to a data visualization application built using P5.js, providing an overview of how it works and encouraging the reader to further explore its code.

Some key concepts covered in this transcript include:

1.  **P5.js library**: A popular JavaScript library for creating interactive, web-based graphics.
2.  **Data visualization**: The process of representing data in a graphical format to aid understanding and interpretation.
3.  **Case study**: An in-depth examination of a particular topic or problem, often used to learn from real-world examples.

Overall, this transcript aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to the P5.js library's capabilities for data visualization, encouraging readers to explore its applications and code structure.

Please let me know if I can assist you with anything else.

## Case study 3: data visualisation Reading• . Duration: 3 hours 3h

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/supplement/nW6GE/case-study-3-data-visualisation)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The goal of this case study is to complete various visualizations using the provided data-vis template. The first task is to complete the visualization defined in tech-diversity-gender.js to create a stacked bar chart representing the proportion of men employed at each company. To do this, one needs to extract relevant data from the raw CSV file, parse it correctly, and use the correct methods to ensure accurate data representation on the plot. The ratio of female:male staff at Indiegogo is 0.5, which should be correctly visualized on the plot.

The next task is to complete the visualization defined in pay-gap-1997-2017.js to create a line graph representing the pay gap between female and male employees over time. This requires extracting relevant data from the raw CSV file, completing the mapPayGapToHeight() method, and using both mapYearToWidth() and mapPayGapToHeight() methods to plot the pay gap over time.

The third task is to complete the visualization defined in climate-change.js to create a line graph with gradient fill background representing the change in Earth's surface temperature. This requires completing the rect() function below the fill() method, using the mapYearToWidth() method, and accessing values within the visualization object.

Finally, tasks are completed for tech-diversity-race.js (pie chart representing racial diversity of prominent tech companies), pay-gap-by-job-2017.js (scatter plot representing difference in pay for men and women across different jobs).

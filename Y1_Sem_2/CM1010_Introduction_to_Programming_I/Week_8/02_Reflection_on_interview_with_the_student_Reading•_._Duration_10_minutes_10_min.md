Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

Simas' interview highlights the importance of considering design improvements for your own project, such as incorporating animation and redesigning core functionality. To incorporate animation into your designs, you'll need to understand its effective use in data visualization. Simas' use of constructor functions can be a good starting point for implementing more complex object-oriented structures in your application. When planning your implementation, consider using techniques like brainstorming and iterating different designs to achieve better outcomes. You should also keep track of your thinking and progress through regular logging, including sources of inspiration and technical help. For the midterm assignment, you'll need to detail your implementation plan and assess your current progress. To maximize the benefit of this process, consider what planning techniques can support advanced feature implementation and how to iterate different designs. As part of the assessment, you'll be asked to reflect on what you've achieved with your project, so start keeping track of your thinking and progress now.

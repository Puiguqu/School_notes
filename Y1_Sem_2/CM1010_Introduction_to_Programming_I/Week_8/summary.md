Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

Simas, a Goldsmiths computer science student, has expanded on a data visualization app to include multiple interactive sketches. He added features such as a pie chart, donut chart, Internet usage sketch, and immunization map, which allow users to explore data by hovering over colors or clicking on specific groups. Simas is particularly proud of the Internet usage sketch, which uses a constructor template to create circles representing different age and sex groups in the UK. He had not programmed before starting the course but was determined to learn and implement complex concepts like constructors. To work on this project, Simas chose data from male and female percentage of Internet usage in 2012 and 2017. One challenge he faced was getting the map functionality working with Leaflet, but he successfully created a new feature despite some technical issues. In retrospect, Simas thinks he could improve the map's performance or try using an alternative library like DS.js to create a 2D density plot. Overall, Simas is pleased with his project and proud of overcoming technical challenges to bring it to life.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

Simas' interview highlights the importance of considering design improvements for your own project, such as incorporating animation and redesigning core functionality. To incorporate animation into your designs, you'll need to understand its effective use in data visualization. Simas' use of constructor functions can be a good starting point for implementing more complex object-oriented structures in your application. When planning your implementation, consider using techniques like brainstorming and iterating different designs to achieve better outcomes. You should also keep track of your thinking and progress through regular logging, including sources of inspiration and technical help. For the midterm assignment, you'll need to detail your implementation plan and assess your current progress. To maximize the benefit of this process, consider what planning techniques can support advanced feature implementation and how to iterate different designs. As part of the assessment, you'll be asked to reflect on what you've achieved with your project, so start keeping track of your thinking and progress now.

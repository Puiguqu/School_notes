Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

In the seventh topic of the module, students explored advanced extensions to their projects, focusing on complex object usage. A log keeping format was introduced for use throughout the project, and students were encouraged to review a checklist to test their knowledge and experience with previous topics. Students watched videos on application extensions, which included techniques such as breaking down code using diagrams to understand structure. They also attempted to implement these extensions either in isolation or by adding them to a template. Additionally, students reviewed material on object orientation if they needed help with the new concepts. Keeping logs of project progress was also emphasized, and students were encouraged to think about how this would help them stay on track with their time planning. At this stage, students should have a solid understanding of their project's direction and be working on implementing the extensions. Students can use the material from this topic to ensure an effective code structure in their projects.

Note: Since there is no specific content or formula mentioned in the original text, I couldn't extract any mathematical formulas or technical details to include in the summary.

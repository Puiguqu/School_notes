There is no text provided for me to summarize. The text appears to be a transcript of a video introduction to Lesson 8, which includes information about upcoming topics and providing assistance with project completion. However, the actual content of Lesson 8 is not provided.

If you provide the text for Lesson 8, I can help you summarize it in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details.

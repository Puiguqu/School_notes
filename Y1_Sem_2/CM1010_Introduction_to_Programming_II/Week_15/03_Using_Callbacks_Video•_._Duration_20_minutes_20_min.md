# Using Callbacks Videoâ€¢ . Duration: 20 minutes 20 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/lecture/y30CG/using-callbacks)

This is a transcription of a video lecture on callbacks in audio processing, specifically for an interactive media or audio visualizer app. Here's the content:

**Introduction**

In this lesson, we'll be exploring callbacks and how to use them in our audio visualizer app.

**Callback Basics**

A callback is a function that's passed as an argument to another function, which then calls it back when something happens. In the context of audio processing, callbacks are used to handle events such as when a sample finishes playing or when a cue is triggered.

**Using Callbacks with Samples**

We'll start by looking at how to use callbacks with samples. We'll create a variable for our screen text and then draw it on the screen whenever the sample is playing. We'll also add cues to trigger specific times in the sound file.

**Callbacks with addCue**

We'll explore the `addCue` method, which allows us to specify precise timings for our cues. We'll use Audacity to fine-tune these timings and get a more accurate response from our starting signal.

**Using Callbacks in Practice**

As we go through this lesson, you should think about how you could apply callbacks to your own audio visualizer app. How could you use them to create interactive and responsive effects?

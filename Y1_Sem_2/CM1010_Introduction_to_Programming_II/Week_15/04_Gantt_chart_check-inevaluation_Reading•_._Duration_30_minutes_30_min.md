# Gantt chart check-in/evaluation Readingâ€¢ . Duration: 30 minutes 30 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/supplement/3Zudo/gantt-chart-check-in-evaluation)

There is not enough information provided in the text to summarize and preserve all key details. The text appears to be a prompt for a lesson review and does not contain any specific content, formulae, links, or technical details.

However, I can provide a summary of the main points:

The text invites students to review their Gantt chart and reflect on its effectiveness in managing their project time. It emphasizes that a Gantt chart should be updated regularly to show progress and identify problems early. The student is encouraged to consider whether they are on track to meet the final deadline, what adjustments need to be made, and how effective the task breakdown was. They are also asked to think about opportunities for additional functionality or testing if they are running ahead of schedule.

If you could provide more context or content from the text, I would be happy to help with a summary.

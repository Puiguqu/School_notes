## Introduction and progress check Video• . Duration: 1 minute 1 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/lecture/Lns1G/introduction-and-progress-check)

Unfortunately, there is no text to summarize as the provided text appears to be a video transcript with links and technical details. However, I can provide a summary of the context and key information from the transcript:

The instructor is providing guidance on completing the midterm assignment for topic 8, which is likely related to software development or programming. The instructor advises students to focus on one extension at a time, as it can be easy to become overwhelmed and lose direction. They recommend keeping notes about the project's progress, including diagrams and sketches, to help with the final report. Additionally, the instructor will assist students with their final report, but encourages them to save any notes or diagrams made during the lesson.

If you could provide more text from a specific source related to "callback" in topic 8, I would be happy to help summarize that information.

## Asynchronous function calls Video• . Duration: 4 minutes 4 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/lecture/MJ687/asynchronous-function-calls)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

Asynchronous function calls in JavaScript allow for non-blocking execution, where the program continues running while waiting for an operation to complete. In synchronous functions, each line of code runs sequentially, pausing until the internal code is executed. Asynchronous functions, on the other hand, allow concurrent execution, enabling other tasks to be performed during the wait period. The `billowed sound` function is an example of an asynchronous function call in P5.js. When loading a sound in the `preload` function, the program continues executing while waiting for the load operation to complete. This can lead to issues, such as undefined values for properties accessed before the load operation is finished, as seen in the provided code example. To resolve this issue, developers can use callbacks or other synchronization mechanisms, as demonstrated by setting a variable equal to `sample.duration` when pressing a key to play the sound. Asynchronous programming allows for more efficient use of processing power, reducing delays and improving overall performance.

## Using Callbacks Video• . Duration: 20 minutes 20 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/lecture/y30CG/using-callbacks)

I can help you with the transcript, but I need to clarify that there is no text provided for me to work with. The transcript appears to be a series of pages from an online course or tutorial, and it's not possible to provide feedback on the content without more information.

However, if you would like to share the text with me, I can help you with the following:

* Summarize the main points of the transcript
* Identify any questions or areas where you need further clarification
* Provide suggestions for improvement or additional resources

Please paste the text from Lesson 8.1 "Introduction and progress check" and I'll be happy to assist you.

## Gantt chart check-in/evaluation Reading• . Duration: 30 minutes 30 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/supplement/3Zudo/gantt-chart-check-in-evaluation)

Unfortunately, this text does not provide any key information, formulae, links, or technical details. It appears to be a prompt for reviewing and evaluating a Gantt chart in a project management context.

However, I can summarize the main points of the prompt:

* Reviewing and updating a Gantt chart is essential for effective project management.
* A Gantt chart should not be a static document, but rather an ongoing tool for tracking progress and identifying problems.
* Key questions to consider when reviewing a Gantt chart include:
 + Are you on target to meet the final project deadline?
 + What adjustments are needed to ensure completion on time?
 + How effective has your chart been at keeping the project on track?
 + Was your breakdown of tasks optimal?
 + Did you pick the correct granularity of tasks?
* If the project is behind schedule, updating the task list is crucial to meeting the final deadline.
* If the project is running ahead of schedule, opportunities for additional functionality or testing may arise.

If you could provide more context or information about the Gantt chart and its content, I would be happy to help further.

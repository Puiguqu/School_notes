## Introduction and progress check Video• . Duration: 1 minute 1 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/lecture/Lns1G/introduction-and-progress-check)

There is no text provided for me to summarize. The text appears to be a transcript of a video introduction to Lesson 8, which includes information about upcoming topics and providing assistance with project completion. However, the actual content of Lesson 8 is not provided.

If you provide the text for Lesson 8, I can help you summarize it in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details.

## Asynchronous function calls Video• . Duration: 4 minutes 4 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/lecture/MJ687/asynchronous-function-calls)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

In JavaScript, function calls can be divided into two categories: synchronous and asynchronous. Synchronous functions execute one after another, causing the code to pause while waiting for the previous function to complete. In contrast, asynchronous functions allow other activities to continue running concurrently with the execution of the function. The `billowed sound` function is an example of an asynchronous function call. When calling an asynchronous function in a preload or callback context, the main function continues executing without waiting for the asynchronous operation to complete. This can lead to issues when trying to access the result of the asynchronous function, such as setting a global variable equal to `sample.duration`. To resolve this issue, developers can use callbacks or other techniques to ensure that the asynchronous operation has completed before accessing its result. Asynchronous programming is useful for efficiently utilizing a computer's processing power and reducing "spinning wheels" in software.

## Using Callbacks Video• . Duration: 20 minutes 20 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/lecture/y30CG/using-callbacks)

This is a transcription of a video lecture on callbacks in audio processing, specifically for an interactive media or audio visualizer app. Here's the content:

**Introduction**

In this lesson, we'll be exploring callbacks and how to use them in our audio visualizer app.

**Callback Basics**

A callback is a function that's passed as an argument to another function, which then calls it back when something happens. In the context of audio processing, callbacks are used to handle events such as when a sample finishes playing or when a cue is triggered.

**Using Callbacks with Samples**

We'll start by looking at how to use callbacks with samples. We'll create a variable for our screen text and then draw it on the screen whenever the sample is playing. We'll also add cues to trigger specific times in the sound file.

**Callbacks with addCue**

We'll explore the `addCue` method, which allows us to specify precise timings for our cues. We'll use Audacity to fine-tune these timings and get a more accurate response from our starting signal.

**Using Callbacks in Practice**

As we go through this lesson, you should think about how you could apply callbacks to your own audio visualizer app. How could you use them to create interactive and responsive effects?

**Additional Resources**

* Lesson 8.1: Introduction and progress check
* Lesson 8.2: Callbacks Video
* Video: Using Callbacks (20 minutes)
* Graded Assignment: Callbacks (15 minutes)

Note that the video lecture is not included in this transcription, but it's assumed to be available separately. The additional resources listed at the end suggest that there may be accompanying materials or activities for students to complete alongside this lesson.

## Gantt chart check-in/evaluation Reading• . Duration: 30 minutes 30 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/supplement/3Zudo/gantt-chart-check-in-evaluation)

There is not enough information provided in the text to summarize and preserve all key details. The text appears to be a prompt for a lesson review and does not contain any specific content, formulae, links, or technical details.

However, I can provide a summary of the main points:

The text invites students to review their Gantt chart and reflect on its effectiveness in managing their project time. It emphasizes that a Gantt chart should be updated regularly to show progress and identify problems early. The student is encouraged to consider whether they are on track to meet the final deadline, what adjustments need to be made, and how effective the task breakdown was. They are also asked to think about opportunities for additional functionality or testing if they are running ahead of schedule.

If you could provide more context or content from the text, I would be happy to help with a summary.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The console has a feature called breakpoints that allows developers to step through their code line by line and inspect variables as they execute. To set a breakpoint, developers can add `console.debug()` or use the "Breakpoints" button in the debugger. Once a breakpoint is set, the execution of the script will stop at that point. Developers can then use various controls, such as "Step Over", "Step Into", and "Step Out", to navigate through their code. These controls allow developers to see how the code executes, inspect variables, and understand what's happening in their program. The "Step Into" command allows developers to execute a function or method, while "Step Over" skips over it without executing its code. By using breakpoints and stepping, developers can identify bugs and debug their code more efficiently. This technique is particularly useful for identifying issues with functions or methods that involve complex operations like JavaScript's `push` function.

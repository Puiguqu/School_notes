# Week 16 - CM1010 Introduction to Programming II - Topic 1 Object orientation in practice - Week 1

## Breakpoints and stepping Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/lecture/xOhN4/breakpoints-and-stepping)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The console has a feature called breakpoints that allows developers to step through their code line by line and inspect variables as they execute. To set a breakpoint, developers can add `console.debug()` or use the "Breakpoints" button in the debugger. Once a breakpoint is set, the execution of the script will stop at that point. Developers can then use various controls, such as "Step Over", "Step Into", and "Step Out", to navigate through their code. These controls allow developers to see how the code executes, inspect variables, and understand what's happening in their program. The "Step Into" command allows developers to execute a function or method, while "Step Over" skips over it without executing its code. By using breakpoints and stepping, developers can identify bugs and debug their code more efficiently. This technique is particularly useful for identifying issues with functions or methods that involve complex operations like JavaScript's `push` function.

## Progress log (assessed) Reading• . Duration: 15 minutes 15 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/supplement/Lve1W/progress-log-assessed)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences:

As your programming project progresses, it's essential to maintain a log of achievements and plans to ensure progress and identify potential issues. The log template should include: project title, current topic, progress made, problems faced and solved, upcoming tasks, on-target completion status, and a plan to address any off-target issues. Completing logs is mandatory for the second half of each topic, and students will need to compile and submit all logs at the end of the project. The logs should be kept safe on their computer and converted to PDF format before submission. A progress log template is provided in both Rich text format (RTF) and Microsoft Word docx format (.DOCX). Students should also keep a record of problems faced and solutions found, as well as their plans for the next few weeks. The logs will be assessed, and students are encouraged to report any issues or concerns they encounter during the project. By maintaining a log and submitting it at the end of the project, students can demonstrate their progress and approach to tackling larger applications.

## Topic 8 summary Reading• . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/supplement/cI0mf/topic-8-summary)

There is no text provided for me to summarize. The text appears to be a module summary or educational content, but it does not contain any specific information that can be summarized into 8 sentences.

However, I can provide a general outline of the topics discussed in the summary:

* Additional JavaScript language techniques
* Debugging techniques for finding complex issues
* Callbacks and their usage in JavaScript
* Synchronous vs asynchronous code
* Breakpoints and stepping
* Code structure

If you could provide the actual text to be summarized, I would be happy to assist you.

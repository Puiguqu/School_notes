Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences:

Throughout the project, it's essential to maintain a log of progress, which will help keep the project on track and allow instructors to assess how students have approached the topic. In each topic's second half, students will be required to complete a log using a specific template, available in both Rich Text Format (RTF) and Microsoft Word formats (.docx). The log should include: project title and current topic; progress made on the topic; problems faced and solved; plan for the next few weeks; on-target completion status; and plans for addressing any issues. Students will compile and submit all logs at the end of the project, ensuring they are safely stored on their computers. After completing all logs, students will convert them to PDF format for submission. The use of a progress log helps instructors evaluate how students have tackled larger applications, providing valuable insights into student learning. Regular progress logging also enables students to identify and address any challenges or issues that arise during the project. By following this template and submitting their logs on time, students can demonstrate their commitment to the project and showcase their progress.

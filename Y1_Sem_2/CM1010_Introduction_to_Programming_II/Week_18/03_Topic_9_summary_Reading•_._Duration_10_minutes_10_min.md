# Topic 9 summary Readingâ€¢ . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/supplement/etGg6/topic-9-summary)

There is no text provided for me to summarize. The given text appears to be a summary of a course or module with instructions on what topics have been covered and what students should do next, but it does not contain specific information about code testing, debugging techniques, profilers, or project logs.

If you provide the actual text you'd like me to summarize, I'll be happy to help.

# Topic 9 summary Readingâ€¢ . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/supplement/etGg6/topic-9-summary)

There is no text provided for me to summarize. The given text appears to be a list of links and instructions for completing a module in a learning environment. It does not contain specific information about code or programming concepts that require summarization.

However, I can provide a general summary of the context:

The text appears to be from a coding tutorial or online course, where students are progressing through a series of lessons on debugging techniques. The ninth topic of the module covers testing code and comparing it with debugging techniques previously taught. Students are encouraged to review a checklist, test their knowledge and experience, and complete a project log to reflect on their progress.

If you provide the actual text about coding concepts or programming problems that require summarization, I would be happy to help.

## Beyond Console.log Video• . Duration: 27 minutes 27 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/lecture/powkL/beyond-console-log)

This is a transcript of an online course lecture on debugging and profiling in JavaScript. The speaker discusses various methods for identifying performance issues in code, including console logging, profiling tools, and memory profiling.

The speaker begins by discussing the importance of understanding performance issues in code, citing examples where slow performance can be detrimental to user experience and business success. They explain that console logging can be useful for debugging, but may not provide a complete picture of performance issues.

Next, the speaker introduces the concept of profiling tools, which allow developers to measure the execution time of specific parts of their code. They discuss various types of profilers, including CPU profilers, memory profilers, and heap profilers.

The speaker then demonstrates how to use a console profiler to identify performance bottlenecks in their own code. They show how to use the built-in `console.time()` function to measure execution time and identify slow-running functions.

In addition to console profiling, the speaker discusses the importance of memory profiling, which allows developers to understand how much memory is being used by their application. They explain how to use a memory profiler to identify memory leaks and optimize memory usage.

The speaker also introduces the concept of Big O notation, which describes the complexity of an algorithm's time or space requirements. They discuss how this can be useful for optimizing code performance.

Finally, the speaker discusses ways to optimize the particle generator in their code, including reducing the number of collisions between particles. They explain how to use a profiler to identify memory usage and optimize memory allocation.

The transcript ends with a summary of the key takeaways from the lecture and an assignment to practice using profiling tools beyond console logging.

Some possible questions or tasks that students might be asked to complete based on this transcript include:

* How would you profile your own code using console.time()?
* What are some common causes of slow performance in JavaScript applications?
* How can Big O notation help optimize algorithm performance?
* How would you implement a particle generator with reduced collisions between particles?

Overall, the transcript provides valuable insights and practical advice for developers looking to improve their debugging and profiling skills.

## Progress log (assessed) Reading• . Duration: 30 minutes 30 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/supplement/G0RXJ/progress-log-assessed)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences:

Throughout the project, it's essential to maintain a log of progress, which will help keep the project on track and allow instructors to assess how students have approached the topic. In each topic's second half, students will be required to complete a log using a specific template, available in both Rich Text Format (RTF) and Microsoft Word formats (.docx). The log should include: project title and current topic; progress made on the topic; problems faced and solved; plan for the next few weeks; on-target completion status; and plans for addressing any issues. Students will compile and submit all logs at the end of the project, ensuring they are safely stored on their computers. After completing all logs, students will convert them to PDF format for submission. The use of a progress log helps instructors evaluate how students have tackled larger applications, providing valuable insights into student learning. Regular progress logging also enables students to identify and address any challenges or issues that arise during the project. By following this template and submitting their logs on time, students can demonstrate their commitment to the project and showcase their progress.

## Topic 9 summary Reading• . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/supplement/etGg6/topic-9-summary)

There is no text provided for me to summarize. The given text appears to be a list of links and instructions for completing a module in a learning environment. It does not contain specific information about code or programming concepts that require summarization.

However, I can provide a general summary of the context:

The text appears to be from a coding tutorial or online course, where students are progressing through a series of lessons on debugging techniques. The ninth topic of the module covers testing code and comparing it with debugging techniques previously taught. Students are encouraged to review a checklist, test their knowledge and experience, and complete a project log to reflect on their progress.

If you provide the actual text about coding concepts or programming problems that require summarization, I would be happy to help.

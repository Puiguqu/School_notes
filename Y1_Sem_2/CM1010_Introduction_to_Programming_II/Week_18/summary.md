## Beyond Console.log Video• . Duration: 27 minutes 27 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/lecture/powkL/beyond-console-log)

This is a transcript of an instructional video on debugging and optimizing code. The instructor discusses the following topics:

1. Introduction to profiling tools
2. Understanding CPU cycles vs. memory usage
3. Identifying performance issues with console.log statements
4. Optimizing code using Big O notation
5. Using memory profilers to diagnose issues

The instructor provides a step-by-step guide on how to use these tools and techniques to debug and optimize the provided code.

**Key takeaways:**

* Use profiling tools to understand the performance bottlenecks in your code.
* Understand the difference between CPU cycles and memory usage.
* Optimize code using Big O notation.
* Use memory profilers to diagnose issues related to memory usage.

**Code snippets:**

The instructor provides several code snippets throughout the video, including:

1. A simple particle generator function
2. An optimized version of the particle generator function using Big O notation
3. Code modifications to use a memory profiler

These code snippets illustrate the concepts discussed in the video and provide examples of how to apply them to real-world coding scenarios.

**Actionable items:**

The instructor suggests several actionable items for viewers to try:

1. Use console.log statements to understand performance bottlenecks.
2. Try optimizing code using Big O notation.
3. Experiment with different profiling tools, such as the memory profiler.

These action items encourage viewers to engage actively with the material and apply the concepts learned in the video to their own coding projects.

**Target audience:**

The instructor appears to be targeting developers who are familiar with JavaScript and have some experience with debugging and optimizing code. The video assumes a certain level of technical knowledge, but provides explanations and examples that should be accessible to viewers with varying levels of expertise.

Overall, this video provides a comprehensive guide to debugging and optimizing code, covering essential topics such as profiling tools, Big O notation, and memory profilers.

## Progress log (assessed) Reading• . Duration: 30 minutes 30 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/supplement/G0RXJ/progress-log-assessed)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences:

As your programming project progresses, it's essential to maintain a log of your progress and future plans to stay on track and demonstrate how you've approached the project. This log will also allow instructors to assess your work and provide feedback. The log template should include the project title, current topic, progress made, problems faced, solutions found, upcoming tasks, and whether the project is on target for completion. Students are expected to compile and submit all logs at the end of the project, ensuring they are safely stored on their computers. The logs will be converted to PDF format for submission. To prepare for the discussion prompt, students should read the progress log assessment (30 minutes). Additionally, a separate log is required for the debugging skills topic, also using the same template as before. By maintaining these logs and following the guidelines, students can effectively track their progress and receive feedback on their project management skills.

## Topic 9 summary Reading• . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/supplement/etGg6/topic-9-summary)

There is no text provided for me to summarize. The given text appears to be a summary of a course or module with instructions on what topics have been covered and what students should do next, but it does not contain specific information about code testing, debugging techniques, profilers, or project logs.

If you provide the actual text you'd like me to summarize, I'll be happy to help.

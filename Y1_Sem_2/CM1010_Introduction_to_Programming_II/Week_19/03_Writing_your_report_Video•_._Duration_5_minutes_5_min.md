Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The report section of your final project submission should provide a technical summary of what you've achieved, how effectively your plan was implemented, and a critical evaluation of the process. The report consists of four questions that can be input on the Coursera platform, with a word limit of around 400 words for the first question. For this section, students are asked to list any modifications and extensions they made to templates, including their functionality, design, and code structure. The second question assesses how effective your plan was in completing the project, considering whether you stuck to the schedule, managed time effectively, and identified challenges. The third question asks for an evaluation of the final product, requiring students to reflect on what they might do differently next time, consider user or system testing results, and identify potential improvements. The fourth question is an opportunity for students to list any external sources used in their project, including code from other languages or online resources like Stack Overflow or library documentation. It's essential to provide specific details and avoid using third-party libraries that might affect the quality of work. A well-structured report with correct English spelling, grammar, and tone is crucial, as is the inclusion of figures and images to support arguments.

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/lecture/f87JN/writing-your-report)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The report section of your final project submission should provide a technical summary of what you've achieved, how effectively your plan was implemented, and a critical evaluation of the process. The report will consist of four questions: (1) modifications and extensions to templates, (2) an assessment of the effectiveness of your plan, (3) an evaluation of your project's final product, and (4) external sources used in your project. For each extension, you should include its functionality, how it was implemented, and how object-oriented programming techniques were used. When evaluating your project's effectiveness, consider whether you stuck to the schedule, divided time effectively, and performed user or system testing. The report should be well-structured, readable, and use correct English spelling and grammar. It should also include figures or images that help make your argument and upload project logs produced over the last few weeks. When referencing external sources, provide specific details and links to the projects or questions used. Using third-party libraries can have a negative effect on your work; instead, demonstrate your coding skills by creating an end result from scratch.

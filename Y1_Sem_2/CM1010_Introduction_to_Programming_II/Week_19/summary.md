There is no text to summarize beyond this point. The provided text appears to be a video transcript and additional page content for a lesson on "Testing with Users" as part of a programming course, specifically CM1010 Introduction to Programming II. It provides instructions on how to navigate through the transcript using keyboard shortcuts and mentions the importance of testing techniques and usability testing in software development.

However, I can provide some key concepts and findings related to user testing and usability:

* User testing involves evaluating an application or software with real users to identify usability issues and gather feedback.
* Usability testing aims to ensure that an application meets the needs and expectations of its target audience.
* Testing techniques for complex elements of a project include identifying pain points, gathering feedback from users, and refining the design based on user input.

If you provide more context or specify which aspects of the text you would like me to focus on, I can attempt to provide further assistance.

## Usability testing Video• . Duration: 7 minutes 7 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/lecture/BhG4p/usability-testing)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

Usability testing is crucial to ensure an application's effectiveness in achieving human goals, such as facilitating creative or logical thought processes. The goal of user testing is to collect data on users' behavior with the application, gathering both qualitative and quantitative data. A common technique for generating nuanced qualitative data is the think-aloud protocol, where users are asked to verbalize their thoughts while interacting with the application. Another approach is to conduct interviews with participants after they complete tasks to gather feedback about their experiences. When planning a user test, it's essential to consider the target audience and design a structured process to ensure consistency between different users of the application. The structure should include clear steps for users to follow, introducing them to the application and utilizing as much of its functionality as possible. To analyze data, look for convergence between users who have had similar problems, and compare task completion times to identify bottlenecks in the application's design. By conducting usability testing and analyzing the collected data, it's possible to determine areas for improvement and evaluate the success of an application in achieving human goals.

## Writing your report Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/lecture/f87JN/writing-your-report)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The report section of your final project submission should provide a technical summary of what you've achieved, how effectively your plan was implemented, and a critical evaluation of the process. The report will consist of four questions: (1) modifications and extensions to templates, (2) an assessment of the effectiveness of your plan, (3) an evaluation of your project's final product, and (4) external sources used in your project. For each extension, you should include its functionality, how it was implemented, and how object-oriented programming techniques were used. When evaluating your project's effectiveness, consider whether you stuck to the schedule, divided time effectively, and performed user or system testing. The report should be well-structured, readable, and use correct English spelling and grammar. It should also include figures or images that help make your argument and upload project logs produced over the last few weeks. When referencing external sources, provide specific details and links to the projects or questions used. Using third-party libraries can have a negative effect on your work; instead, demonstrate your coding skills by creating an end result from scratch.

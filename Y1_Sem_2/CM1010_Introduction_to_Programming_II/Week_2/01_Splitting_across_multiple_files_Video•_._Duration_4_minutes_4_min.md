Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The instructor is providing a technique to organize code by splitting it into multiple files for larger applications. In a game project that involved writing 800,000 lines of code in one file, they will now divide this code into several files with separate constructor functions, making the code more organized and easier to find. The practical example from last module is used to demonstrate this technique, where two constructor functions (Emitter and Particle) are copied and pasted into new files (Emitter.js and Particle.js). Each file includes a constructor function, allowing for better organization and reusability of code. To link these files together, script tags with the necessary file names (p5, Emitter.js, and Particle.js) must be added to the sketch file in the correct order. The instructor notes that the order is important, with p5 followed by constructor functions, then the sketch file. This technique makes it easier to find and maintain code, making it ideal for larger projects. By following this approach, developers can improve their coding skills and create more efficient programs.

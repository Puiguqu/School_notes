Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The instructor presents a technique for organizing code in larger applications, such as game projects with extensive sketch files. The goal is to split up code into multiple files, including constructor functions, to make it more organized and easier to maintain. The instructor uses a practical example from the previous module, copying and pasting constructor functions into new files (Emitter.js and Particle.js) to demonstrate this technique. Each file has its own name as the constructor function, and the instructor emphasizes the importance of saving with a `.js` extension for syntax highlighting. To load these files in the sketch, a new `scripts` tag is added to the HTML, referencing both `p5`, the constructor functions, and the sketch file itself. The order of the script tags matters, with `p5` first, followed by the constructor functions, and finally the sketch file. A refresh of the live preview feature in the text editor resolves an issue with loading files in the wrong order. By organizing code into multiple files, developers can make their code more manageable, readable, and maintainable for themselves and others.

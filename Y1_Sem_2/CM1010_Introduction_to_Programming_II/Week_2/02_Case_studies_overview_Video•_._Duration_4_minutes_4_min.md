Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

In this module on object orientation and code organization, students will apply their knowledge to larger applications. The project involves creating a big application by combining smaller elements, with three case studies to choose from: a simple drawing application using p5.js DOM library, a music visualization app using p5.js sound library, and a data visualization app using p5.js table object. Each case study will explore different techniques and features, such as constructor functions, object orientation, and external libraries. The project requires students to design, implement, test, and evaluate their extensions, with assessments on technical implementation, planning, organization, and evaluative skills. The drawing application uses basic tools for drawing lines and airbrushing, while the music visualization app can create visual patterns from sound wave properties. Students will also learn about debugging techniques and guidance on keeping track of progress. After completing case studies, students will choose one to base their project on, with instructor support and resources provided throughout the process. The module aims to develop not only coding skills but also effective coding practices, such as organization, planning, and evaluation.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The second module of the Introduction to Programming course focuses on cementing knowledge from the first module and understanding larger applications. The module covers object orientation and dividing code into manageable chunks to organize and navigate through the codebase. Three bare-bones applications written in JavaScript using p5.js will be presented over the next three topics, each utilizing constructor functions, object orientation, and additional libraries or objects. Each application has been designed to be extended with new features, tools, and functionality for completion of an exercise and peer review. The exercises will be validated by classmates, and students will create creative extensions and new tools for each application. The assessments will not only focus on technical implementation but also on planning, organization, and evaluative skills. Three case studies will be introduced: a simple drawing application using the p5.js DOM library, a music visualization app utilizing the p5.js sound library, and a data visualization app using the p5.js table object. After completing the case studies, students will choose one to base their project on and receive guidance on extensions, debugging techniques, and progress tracking.

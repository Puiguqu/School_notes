# Programming exercise: hack it – zombie attack Reading• . Duration: 1 hour 1h

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/supplement/ifag6/programming-exercise-hack-it-zombie-attack)

There is no text provided for me to summarize. The prompt you gave me was incomplete and didn't include any relevant information about a specific text to be summarized.

However, I can provide some general guidance on how to approach the task of summarizing the original text:

1. The program creates a horde of zombies that move across the canvas.
2. Enhancements are suggested:
* Split the code into multiple files for each constructor
* Add a health property to each zombie
* Introduce a shovel and implement its functionality
3. When a zombie's head is clicked, their health should decrease.
4. Upon a zombie's death, a new zombie should be added to the horde.

If you could provide the actual text, I would be happy to assist with summarizing it in 8 sentences while preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details.

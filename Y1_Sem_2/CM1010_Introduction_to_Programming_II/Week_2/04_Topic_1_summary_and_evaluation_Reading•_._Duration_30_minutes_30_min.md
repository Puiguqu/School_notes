Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

In this module, students have reviewed object orientation techniques introduced at the end of Introduction to Programming I and have gained a formal understanding of object orientation. They can now use these techniques to make their programs more readable and extendable. To assess their knowledge, students should review the checklist provided, which includes implementing the zombie horde example and completing the chocolate shop debug challenge. Students must be able to explain the theory of object orientation, including abstraction and encapsulation. They also need to know how to write constructor functions in JavaScript, convert applications from variables to object literals and constructor functions, divide code into multiple files, and implement public and private members. Additionally, students should understand the effect of passing by value on objects and simple variables. By mastering these concepts, students will be able to use object orientation techniques extensively in future applications and assessments. Reviewing the topic summary and evaluation is also required before moving on to the next topic.

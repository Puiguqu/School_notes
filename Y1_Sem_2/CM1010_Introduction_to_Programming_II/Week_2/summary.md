## Splitting across multiple files Video• . Duration: 4 minutes 4 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/lecture/Um0In/splitting-across-multiple-files)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The instructor presents a technique for organizing code in larger applications, such as game projects with extensive sketch files. The goal is to split up code into multiple files, including constructor functions, to make it more organized and easier to maintain. The instructor uses a practical example from the previous module, copying and pasting constructor functions into new files (Emitter.js and Particle.js) to demonstrate this technique. Each file has its own name as the constructor function, and the instructor emphasizes the importance of saving with a `.js` extension for syntax highlighting. To load these files in the sketch, a new `scripts` tag is added to the HTML, referencing both `p5`, the constructor functions, and the sketch file itself. The order of the script tags matters, with `p5` first, followed by the constructor functions, and finally the sketch file. A refresh of the live preview feature in the text editor resolves an issue with loading files in the wrong order. By organizing code into multiple files, developers can make their code more manageable, readable, and maintainable for themselves and others.

## Case studies overview Video• . Duration: 4 minutes 4 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/lecture/OMXFJ/case-studies-overview)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

In this module on object orientation and code organization, students will apply their knowledge to larger applications. The project involves creating a big application by combining smaller elements, with three case studies to choose from: a simple drawing application using p5.js DOM library, a music visualization app using p5.js sound library, and a data visualization app using p5.js table object. Each case study will explore different techniques and features, such as constructor functions, object orientation, and external libraries. The project requires students to design, implement, test, and evaluate their extensions, with assessments on technical implementation, planning, organization, and evaluative skills. The drawing application uses basic tools for drawing lines and airbrushing, while the music visualization app can create visual patterns from sound wave properties. Students will also learn about debugging techniques and guidance on keeping track of progress. After completing case studies, students will choose one to base their project on, with instructor support and resources provided throughout the process. The module aims to develop not only coding skills but also effective coding practices, such as organization, planning, and evaluation.

## Programming exercise: hack it – zombie attack Reading• . Duration: 1 hour 1h

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/supplement/ifag6/programming-exercise-hack-it-zombie-attack)

Here's a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and details:

The program creates a horde of zombies that cross a canvas. The task is to enhance the code by splitting it into multiple files, each containing a different constructor. Each zombie should have a health property assigned to it. A shovel should be added to the game. When a zombie's head is clicked, its health decreases. If a zombie's health reaches zero, a new zombie should be added to the horde. The ultimate goal of the enhanced program can be made into a game where zombies need to be kept from the right side of the screen for as long as possible. The starter code is provided in a ZIP file.

## Topic 1 summary and evaluation Reading• . Duration: 30 minutes 30 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/supplement/wTpMp/topic-1-summary-and-evaluation)

There is no text provided for me to summarize. The text appears to be a module summary from a programming course, outlining the key concepts and topics covered in the first topic of the module. It provides a checklist for students to review their knowledge and experience with object-oriented programming techniques.

However, I can provide a summary of the content if you would like:

The first topic of the module reviews object orientation techniques introduced at the end of Introduction to Programming I. Students have extended their knowledge with a formal understanding of object orientation and its benefits in making programs more readable and extendable. The topic will build upon this foundation, becoming increasingly important throughout the module. Key concepts covered include abstraction and encapsulation, constructor functions in JavaScript, object literals, converting applications to use multiple files, public and private members, and debugging complex issues. Students are encouraged to implement the zombie horde example and complete the chocolate shop debug challenge to demonstrate their understanding. A checklist is provided for students to review their knowledge and experience. The topic also includes a video on case studies overview and a reading assignment to summarize and evaluate the topic.

Please provide the actual text if you would like me to summarize it in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details.

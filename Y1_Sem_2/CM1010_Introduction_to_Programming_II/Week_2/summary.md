## Splitting across multiple files Video• . Duration: 4 minutes 4 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/lecture/Um0In/splitting-across-multiple-files)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The instructor is providing a technique to organize code by splitting it into multiple files for larger applications. In a game project that involved writing 800,000 lines of code in one file, they will now divide this code into several files with separate constructor functions, making the code more organized and easier to find. The practical example from last module is used to demonstrate this technique, where two constructor functions (Emitter and Particle) are copied and pasted into new files (Emitter.js and Particle.js). Each file includes a constructor function, allowing for better organization and reusability of code. To link these files together, script tags with the necessary file names (p5, Emitter.js, and Particle.js) must be added to the sketch file in the correct order. The instructor notes that the order is important, with p5 followed by constructor functions, then the sketch file. This technique makes it easier to find and maintain code, making it ideal for larger projects. By following this approach, developers can improve their coding skills and create more efficient programs.

## Case studies overview Video• . Duration: 4 minutes 4 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/lecture/OMXFJ/case-studies-overview)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The second module of the Introduction to Programming course focuses on cementing knowledge from the first module and understanding larger applications. The module covers object orientation and dividing code into manageable chunks to organize and navigate through the codebase. Three bare-bones applications written in JavaScript using p5.js will be presented over the next three topics, each utilizing constructor functions, object orientation, and additional libraries or objects. Each application has been designed to be extended with new features, tools, and functionality for completion of an exercise and peer review. The exercises will be validated by classmates, and students will create creative extensions and new tools for each application. The assessments will not only focus on technical implementation but also on planning, organization, and evaluative skills. Three case studies will be introduced: a simple drawing application using the p5.js DOM library, a music visualization app utilizing the p5.js sound library, and a data visualization app using the p5.js table object. After completing the case studies, students will choose one to base their project on and receive guidance on extensions, debugging techniques, and progress tracking.

## Programming exercise: hack it – zombie attack Reading• . Duration: 1 hour 1h

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/supplement/ifag6/programming-exercise-hack-it-zombie-attack)

There is no text provided for me to summarize. The prompt you gave me was incomplete and didn't include any relevant information about a specific text to be summarized.

However, I can provide some general guidance on how to approach the task of summarizing the original text:

1. The program creates a horde of zombies that move across the canvas.
2. Enhancements are suggested:
* Split the code into multiple files for each constructor
* Add a health property to each zombie
* Introduce a shovel and implement its functionality
3. When a zombie's head is clicked, their health should decrease.
4. Upon a zombie's death, a new zombie should be added to the horde.

If you could provide the actual text, I would be happy to assist with summarizing it in 8 sentences while preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details.

## Topic 1 summary and evaluation Reading• . Duration: 30 minutes 30 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/supplement/wTpMp/topic-1-summary-and-evaluation)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

In this module, students have reviewed object orientation techniques introduced at the end of Introduction to Programming I and have gained a formal understanding of object orientation. They can now use these techniques to make their programs more readable and extendable. To assess their knowledge, students should review the checklist provided, which includes implementing the zombie horde example and completing the chocolate shop debug challenge. Students must be able to explain the theory of object orientation, including abstraction and encapsulation. They also need to know how to write constructor functions in JavaScript, convert applications from variables to object literals and constructor functions, divide code into multiple files, and implement public and private members. Additionally, students should understand the effect of passing by value on objects and simple variables. By mastering these concepts, students will be able to use object orientation techniques extensively in future applications and assessments. Reviewing the topic summary and evaluation is also required before moving on to the next topic.

# Progress log (assessed) Readingâ€¢ . Duration: 30 minutes 30 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/supplement/ShJJ8/progress-log-assessed)

There is no text provided for me to summarize. The text appears to be a lesson plan or a guide for students working on a project, and it does not contain any specific information that can be summarized into 8 sentences.

However, I can provide a general summary of the main points from the text:

The instructor encourages students to keep a log of their project progress, which will help them stay on track and allow instructors to evaluate their approach. The log should include the following details: project title and current topic, progress made, problems faced and solved, future plans, and whether they are on target to complete the project. Students will need to compile and submit all logs at the end of the project, which should be in a PDF format. The instructor has provided a template for the log, which can be used in either Rich Text Format or Microsoft Word docx format.

If you provide the actual text, I would be happy to assist you with summarizing it into 8 sentences while preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details.

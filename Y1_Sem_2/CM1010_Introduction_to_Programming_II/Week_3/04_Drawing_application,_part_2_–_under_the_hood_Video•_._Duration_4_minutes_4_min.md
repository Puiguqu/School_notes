# Drawing application, part 2 – under the hood Video• . Duration: 4 minutes 4 min

Unfortunately, the provided text is not a typical text that can be summarized in 8 sentences. It appears to be a video transcript of a tutorial or lecture on a programming topic, specifically using the Processing (P5) language.

However, I can try to summarize the main concepts and findings from the transcript:

The transcript discusses the use of two key functions in P5: `loadPixels` and `updatePixels`. These functions allow developers to store and restore the drawing state of an image, effectively implementing an undo feature. The narrator demonstrates how these functions are used in the line tool, where they record the initial drawing state and then draw on top of it, creating a persistent line.

The transcript also mentions the mirror draw tool, but does not provide further explanation or code examples for its functionality.

Some additional resources and assignments are listed at the end of the transcript, including videos, readings, practice assignments, and graded assignments related to P5 programming and HTML.

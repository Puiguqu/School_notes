1. Introduction to P5.js and its DOM features
2. Preparing for a case study (not specified in this particular transcript)
3. Using the mirror tool (not explicitly mentioned, but implied by the context of creating a drawing application)
4. Creating a simple drawing application using P5.js and its DOM capabilities

The transcript also includes some code snippets and explanations of how to use certain features of P5.js, such as:

* Creating buttons and controls
* Using selectors to update values in a robot object
* Setting the rotation mode to degrees
* Drawing text with a specific alignment and font size

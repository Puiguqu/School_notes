Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The drawing app's symmetry tool has two methods to manipulate its behavior: populate options and unselect tool. The populate options method creates an extra HTML element with the class "options" when the tool is selected, allowing for customization of button options. In contrast, the unselect tool method updates pixels by reloading images stored in memory, effectively resetting the drawing without leaving behind a red line. When the user deselects the symmetry tool, the unselect method empties the HTML element with the class "options", preventing unnecessary buttons from appearing when switching to other tools. The symmetry tool's behavior is influenced by two methods: populate options and update pixels. Understanding these methods is crucial for implementing custom tools and extensions in the drawing app. To learn more about the mirror tool, refer to Lesson 2.1, while additional resources on HTML, P5.dom, and event handling can be found through links provided.

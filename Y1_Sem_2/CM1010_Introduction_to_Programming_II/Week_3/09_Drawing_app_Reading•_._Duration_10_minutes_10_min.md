# Drawing app Readingâ€¢ . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/supplement/buW83/drawing-app)

There is not enough information in the text to create a summary. The provided text appears to be a brief introduction to a case study topic, specifically the "drawing app" application, without any technical details or findings. It seems to be more of a promotional text for an online course or tutorial rather than a formal research paper or academic article.

If you could provide more context or information about the drawing app and its related content, I would be happy to help summarize it in 8 sentences, preserving key concepts and findings.

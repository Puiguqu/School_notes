There is no text provided for me to summarize. The text appears to be a video transcript and accompanying lesson plan for an online course or tutorial on programming, specifically focusing on a drawing application. It provides information about the history of drawing applications, introduces the concept of object-oriented programming, and outlines the structure of the app's code.

The transcript mentions the importance of understanding the app's features through diagramming and problem-solving in code. It also provides recommendations for watching videos, including a link to Andy Warhol's digital artwork demonstration at Warhol.org.

The lesson plan includes practice assignments, reading materials, video tutorials, and a case study on the drawing app, with specific time allocations for each activity. However, without more context or information about the specific drawing application being discussed, it is challenging to summarize the key concepts and findings in 8 sentences.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The speaker is using a drawing app and recording its features. They are creating a bubble chart to visualize the app's functions, including a pen tool, line tool, spray can, symmetry tool, save image feature, clear image feature, color selection, and options for horizontal and vertical symmetry. The speaker demonstrates each feature by interacting with the app, noting that some features have additional options or sub-features. They also note that certain features, such as colors and symmetry options, can be applied to different tools. The speaker's bubble chart is created on paper, inviting the reader to recreate it for practice purposes. Later, in this topic, the student will revisit the diagram to analyze its contents further. The text introduces a drawing app as a case study, with accompanying video transcripts and reading materials.

## Drawing application, part 2 – under the hood Video• . Duration: 4 minutes 4 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/lecture/UBb5Z/drawing-application-part-2-under-the-hood)

Unfortunately, the provided text is not a typical text that can be summarized in 8 sentences. It appears to be a video transcript of a tutorial or lecture on a programming topic, specifically using the Processing (P5) language.

However, I can try to summarize the main concepts and findings from the transcript:

The transcript discusses the use of two key functions in P5: `loadPixels` and `updatePixels`. These functions allow developers to store and restore the drawing state of an image, effectively implementing an undo feature. The narrator demonstrates how these functions are used in the line tool, where they record the initial drawing state and then draw on top of it, creating a persistent line.

The transcript also mentions the mirror draw tool, but does not provide further explanation or code examples for its functionality.

Some additional resources and assignments are listed at the end of the transcript, including videos, readings, practice assignments, and graded assignments related to P5 programming and HTML.

## Drawing application 2 Video• . Duration: 3 minutes 3 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/lecture/BvbpS/drawing-application-2)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The drawing app's symmetry tool has two methods to manipulate its behavior: populate options and unselect tool. The populate options method creates an extra HTML element with the class "options" when the tool is selected, allowing for customization of button options. In contrast, the unselect tool method updates pixels by reloading images stored in memory, effectively resetting the drawing without leaving behind a red line. When the user deselects the symmetry tool, the unselect method empties the HTML element with the class "options", preventing unnecessary buttons from appearing when switching to other tools. The symmetry tool's behavior is influenced by two methods: populate options and update pixels. Understanding these methods is crucial for implementing custom tools and extensions in the drawing app. To learn more about the mirror tool, refer to Lesson 2.1, while additional resources on HTML, P5.dom, and event handling can be found through links provided.

## Case study 1: drawing app Reading• . Duration: 2 hours 2h

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/supplement/iPuwr/case-study-1-drawing-app)

Here is the rewritten text in a format that is easier to read and understand:

**Case Study 1: Drawing App**

To complete this case study, follow these steps:

1. Open the drawing app folder by dragging it into Visual Studio Code or Brackets.
2. Click on the "Live Preview" button to open the application in your browser.
3. Try out all the tools in the drawing application:
	* Freehand tool
	* Line draw tool
	* Spray can tool
	* Mirror draw tool

Notice that the "Clear" and "Save" buttons don't work yet. We'll address those soon.

**Reading the Files**

Before you start altering the application, read through the various files that make up the drawing application template:

1. `index.html`: HTML content of the application
2. `style.css`: Style sheet for the application
3. `sketch.js`: p5.js sketch with setup and draw functions
4. `p5.min.js`: p5 library (don't worry too much about this one)
5. `colourPalette.js` and `toolbox.js`: Container functions that you don't need to fully understand, but might use some properties from

**Tasks**

Complete the following tasks:

1. **Task 1: Documenting lineToTool.js**
	* Open `lineToTool.js` and read it out loud to a friend or family member.
	* Try commenting out two lines of code to see how it affects the program.
2. **Task 2: Turning sprayCan into a constructor function**
	* Cut the spray can object literal from `sketch.js` and paste it into a new file called `sprayCanTool.js`.
	* Rewrite the object literal as a constructor function called `SprayCanTool()`.
	* Don't forget to add properties and methods with `this` (e.g. `this.points = 13`).
3. **Task 3: Completing helperFunctions**
	* Read through `helperFunctions.js` and find the two event handlers for saving and clearing.
	* Replace `???` on line 9 with the p5.js background function to reset the color to white.
	* Replace `???` on line 19 with a function to save the canvas.

**Further Enhancements**

When you've completed these tasks:

1. Take a look at the mirror tool and try to understand how it works.
2. Try writing your own tools, like a rectangle tool or an ellipse tool.
3. When you're done, upload your completed drawing app sketch for peer review.

This will give you feedback on your progress and help you determine if you've fully understood the tasks. The peer review activity is scheduled for next week's content.

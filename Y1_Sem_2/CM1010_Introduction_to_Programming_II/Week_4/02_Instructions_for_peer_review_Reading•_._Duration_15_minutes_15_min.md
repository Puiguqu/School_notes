Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

Peer review is a collaborative process where students, scholars, or researchers evaluate each other's work to provide feedback and learn from one another. In an academic setting, peer review involves carefully reading a peer's assignment to critique its content and arguments. As part of a Computer Science program, peer reviews may be required assignments, with two parts: submitting your own assignment and grading a minimum number of peers' submitted assignments. To receive a grade for your own assignment, you must complete the peer review process. A rubric is provided to ensure grading consistency and help learners understand the expectations of each assignment. The purpose of peer review is not just to critique but to offer constructive feedback that can help authors improve their work. Peer review enhances critical thinking, improves writing and research skills, offers new perspectives, fosters a sense of community, prepares for future academic and professional endeavors, enhances learning and retention, develops empathy and communication skills, provides insight into the review process, increases exposure to diverse research interests, and boosts confidence in academic abilities.

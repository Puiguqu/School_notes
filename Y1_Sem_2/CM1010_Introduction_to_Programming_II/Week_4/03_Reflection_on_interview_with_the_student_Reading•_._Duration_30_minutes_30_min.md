Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The course encourages students to reflect on their own project progress after watching an interview with Evan, who built a drawing application using p5.js. Students should consider whether they can add features like Evan's simple or advanced tools to their own implementation, which could help in planning. The midterm assignment requires detailing the implementation plan, and students should use planning techniques, brainstorming, and iterating designs to achieve better outcomes. To assess progress, students should keep track of brainstorming designs, sketches, sources of inspiration, technical help, and regular logging of progress. This will be required for submission at the midterm or end-of-term assignments. Evan's video interview discussed what he would do differently and reflected on his project achievements, which students will also need to do when submitting their final application. To prepare, students should start keeping track of their thinking and progress now, as this will help with the evaluation process. The p5.js features mentioned include 3D, which requires specific technical skills and planning.

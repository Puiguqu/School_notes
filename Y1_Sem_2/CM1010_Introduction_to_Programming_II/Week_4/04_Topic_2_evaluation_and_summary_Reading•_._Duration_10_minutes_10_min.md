Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

This module's second topic introduces the first case study application that will form the basis of the project. The topic also covers accessing and manipulating the HTML DOM from p5.js to support application features. A review checklist is provided for students to test their knowledge and understanding of the topics discussed. Students should be familiar with the basics of the HTML Document Object Model and how it can be manipulated in JavaScript using p5.js. They should also be able to follow the diagram of the drawing application structure from the 'under the hood' videos. Additionally, students are expected to have completed the case study and can describe their changes. The video "Interview with the student" (9 minutes) is available for review, which discusses planning and brainstorming importance for applications. A reading reflection on the interview (30 minutes) and a topic evaluation summary (10 minutes) are also provided to help students assess their understanding of the topics discussed in this second topic.

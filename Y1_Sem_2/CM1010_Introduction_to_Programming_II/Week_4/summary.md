This transcript appears to be a recording of an interview between a teacher and a student, Evan Griffiths, about his project in a computer graphics course. The project involved modifying the P5.js library to add 3D rendering capabilities to a graphical user interface.

Here is a summary of the key points discussed during the interview:

1. **Modifications made to the project**: Evan discussed the various changes he made to the original template, including adding support for WebGL rendering, creating a new `SketchModel` class to handle 3D object loading and rendering, and modifying the user interface to accommodate the new features.
2. **Challenges encountered during development**: Evan mentioned that some of the challenges he faced while working on the project included dealing with issues related to the P5.js library's WebGL support and optimizing performance for smooth rendering.
3. **User interface modifications**: He discussed how he added features such as a red highlight box around the selected 3D object, which was useful for understanding its transformations and interactions.
4. **Potential improvements for future projects**: Evan mentioned that if he had to work on this project again, he would focus on making some of the code more readable and maintainable, especially considering potential updates to the P5.js library.

Overall, the interview provides valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities encountered during the development of a 3D graphics project using P5.js.

## Instructions for peer review Reading• . Duration: 15 minutes 15 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/supplement/JnLC6/instructions-for-peer-review)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

Peer review is a collaborative process where students, scholars, or researchers evaluate each other's work to provide feedback and learn from one another. In an academic setting, peer review involves carefully reading a peer's assignment to critique its content and arguments. As part of a Computer Science program, peer reviews may be required assignments, with two parts: submitting your own assignment and grading a minimum number of peers' submitted assignments. To receive a grade for your own assignment, you must complete the peer review process. A rubric is provided to ensure grading consistency and help learners understand the expectations of each assignment. The purpose of peer review is not just to critique but to offer constructive feedback that can help authors improve their work. Peer review enhances critical thinking, improves writing and research skills, offers new perspectives, fosters a sense of community, prepares for future academic and professional endeavors, enhances learning and retention, develops empathy and communication skills, provides insight into the review process, increases exposure to diverse research interests, and boosts confidence in academic abilities.

## Reflection on interview with the student Reading• . Duration: 30 minutes 30 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/supplement/Unq5J/reflection-on-interview-with-the-student)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The course encourages students to reflect on their own project progress after watching an interview with Evan, who built a drawing application using p5.js. Students should consider whether they can add features like Evan's simple or advanced tools to their own implementation, which could help in planning. The midterm assignment requires detailing the implementation plan, and students should use planning techniques, brainstorming, and iterating designs to achieve better outcomes. To assess progress, students should keep track of brainstorming designs, sketches, sources of inspiration, technical help, and regular logging of progress. This will be required for submission at the midterm or end-of-term assignments. Evan's video interview discussed what he would do differently and reflected on his project achievements, which students will also need to do when submitting their final application. To prepare, students should start keeping track of their thinking and progress now, as this will help with the evaluation process. The p5.js features mentioned include 3D, which requires specific technical skills and planning.

## Topic 2 evaluation and summary Reading• . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/supplement/nZfcd/topic-2-evaluation-and-summary)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

This module's second topic introduces the first case study application that will form the basis of the project. The topic also covers accessing and manipulating the HTML DOM from p5.js to support application features. A review checklist is provided for students to test their knowledge and understanding of the topics discussed. Students should be familiar with the basics of the HTML Document Object Model and how it can be manipulated in JavaScript using p5.js. They should also be able to follow the diagram of the drawing application structure from the 'under the hood' videos. Additionally, students are expected to have completed the case study and can describe their changes. The video "Interview with the student" (9 minutes) is available for review, which discusses planning and brainstorming importance for applications. A reading reflection on the interview (30 minutes) and a topic evaluation summary (10 minutes) are also provided to help students assess their understanding of the topics discussed in this second topic.

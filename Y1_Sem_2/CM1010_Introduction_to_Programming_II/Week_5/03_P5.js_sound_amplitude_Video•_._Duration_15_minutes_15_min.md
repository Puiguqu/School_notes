Based on the provided transcript, I will summarize the main points of Lesson 3.1 Introduction to amplitude analysis in P5.js.

**Summary**

In this lesson, students learn how to analyze sound using P5.js. The first step is to create a simple program that loads and plays a sound file using the `loadSound()` function. Once the sound is loaded, students can measure its amplitude using the `amplitude()` function. Amplitude represents the magnitude of the sound wave at any given time.

**Key Concepts**

1. **Amplitude analysis**: Measuring the magnitude of a sound wave over time.
2. **P5.js sound functions**: `loadSound()`, `play()`, and `amp()` (short for amplitude).
3. **Visualizing amplitude**: Using the `beginShape()`, `vertex()`, and `endShape()` functions to create visual representations of amplitude.

**Practical Exercise**

Students are encouraged to:

1. Experiment with different sound files to observe changes in amplitude.
2. Create animations using amplitude, such as changing the size or rotation of graphics.
3. Explore how amplitude affects musical composition.

By analyzing amplitude, students can gain insights into the properties of sound waves and create interactive visualizations that respond to audio input. This skill is essential for creating engaging music visualizations and understanding the relationship between sound and visuals.

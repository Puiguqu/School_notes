Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The concept of frequency is an important aspect of sound quality, where pitch is directly related to frequency. Human hearing range spans from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz, but factors like amplitude and listener age can affect audibility. Certain sounds, such as the triangle and kettledrum, cannot be precisely measured due to their complex composition of multiple frequencies. In contrast, single notes on a piano can be described using a single frequency, while chords require considering multiple frequencies and amplitudes. To accurately describe a sound digitally, one must measure every possible frequency from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz and record its amplitude, resulting in a frequency spectrum. Frequency bands are used to group together too many frequencies, making it impractical to consider all 18,980 possible frequencies simultaneously. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) objects in p5.js can be used to create a rolling frequency spectrum for music tracks, allowing for the analysis of sound properties like amplitude and pitch over time. By understanding frequency spectra and their applications, one can gain insight into the complex nature of sound and develop skills for analyzing and manipulating audio signals.

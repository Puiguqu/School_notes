**Lesson Topic:** Analyzing Sound using P5.js

**Key Concepts:**

1. Introduction to P5.js sound functionality
2. Loading and playing sounds in P5.js
3. Amplitude analysis (making music compositions)
4. Frequency analysis (playing with frequency bands)

**Learning Objectives:**

* Understand how to load and play sounds in P5.js
* Learn about amplitude analysis for making music compositions
* Discover how to analyze sound using frequency bands

**Practice Assignments:**

1. Analyzing sound (30 minutes): Students are asked to experiment with analyzing sound in P5.js.
2. Exploring a music visualisation app (30 minutes): Students learn about a specific music visualisation application and its underlying technology.

**Additional Resources:**

* Videos: tutorials on loading sounds, amplitude analysis, frequency analysis, and creating music compositions.
* Reading materials: articles on reading sound data and playing with amplitude.
* Interviews: an interview with a student who has experience with music visualisation applications.

This lesson provides students with hands-on experience in analyzing sound using P5.js, which is essential for creating interactive audio-visual experiences. By exploring the concepts of amplitude analysis and frequency bands, students can develop their skills in understanding and manipulating sound data.

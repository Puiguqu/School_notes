Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

Taylor, a first-year computer science student at Goldsmiths, built an application for his Introduction to Programming project based on the music visualization app. The application features four different visualizations: Spin, which reacts to waveform and spectrum analysis of the FFT algorithm; Video, which uses the pixel array to change colors in real-time; Store Waveform, which moves when clicked; and a third visualization that Taylor did not explain further. Taylor's favorite visualization is Video, which uses the pixel array to edit RGB values depending on the volume or amplitude of certain frequencies. This was achieved by using the p5 library and filling the pixel array with new colors in the draw function. The application also features simple controls, including a play button, dial key presses, and a beat analyzer that Taylor wanted to implement but did not have time for. Taylor's inspiration for the Video app came from wanting to use video from the computer's camera and react it fluidly with music. The application was built using p5.js, which allows for easy manipulation of colors and pixels. Taylor would recommend using other color systems, such as HSB or HSV, in future projects.

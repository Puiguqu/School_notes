Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences:

The video tutorial demonstrates how to use amplitude to alter the volume of p5.js sketches. To complete the exercise, follow these steps: create a global variable "amplitude" with an initial value of a new p5 Amplitude object in setup. In the draw function, calculate the current level of amplitude and display it on the screen using text() or an ellipse that changes size based on the amplitude. Use the map function to scale the ellipse and the array amplitudes to display as a series of ellipses across the screen. Push the current amplitude to the end of the amplitudes array in draw, and remove the first value using shift. This will create an animation of ellipses changing size based on the amplitude of the sound file. The exercise encourages thinking about other forms of animation that could be designed using amplitude. To complete the exercise, download the ZIP file from the video resources or link provided.

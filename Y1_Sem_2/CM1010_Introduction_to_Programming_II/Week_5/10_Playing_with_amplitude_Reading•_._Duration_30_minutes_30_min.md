There is no text provided for me to summarize. The text appears to be a video description and instructions on how to complete a template in p5.js sketches, specifically related to amplitude and sound visualization.

However, I can provide a summary of the concepts and findings based on the general information about amplitude and sound visualization in p5.js:

Amplitude is a fundamental concept in sound visualization that refers to the maximum magnitude or loudness of a sound wave. In p5.js, amplitude can be used to control the volume of sounds and create visualizations that respond to changes in amplitude.

To visualize amplitude in p5.js, developers can use the `p5.Amplitude` object to track changes in amplitude over time. The `map()` function can then be used to scale the amplitude values to a range of values that can be displayed as ellipses or other shapes on the screen.

In this specific template, users are instructed to:

1. Create an amplitude global variable and set its initial value to a new `p5.Amplitude` object in setup.
2. Use the `map()` function to scale the amplitude values to display ellipses that change size based on the amplitude.
3. Create a global array `amplitudes` to store past amplitude values, which can be used to create a visualization of changes in amplitude over time.

Overall, this template demonstrates how to use p5.js's built-in `p5.Amplitude` object and the `map()` function to create an interactive sound visualization that responds to changes in amplitude.

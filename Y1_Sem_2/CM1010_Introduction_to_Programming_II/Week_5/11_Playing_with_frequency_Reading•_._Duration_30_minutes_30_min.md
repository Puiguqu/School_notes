There is no text provided for me to summarize. The text appears to be a description of a video tutorial on using p5.js with sound, specifically frequency analysis and music visualization. 

If you provide the actual text or context, I can help you summarize it in 8 sentences while preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details.

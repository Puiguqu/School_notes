Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The video tutorial by Simon covers the basics of frequency and volume alteration in p5.js sketches. To complete the template, download the ZIP file or access it from the provided link. In the sketch, create a global variable "fft" and set it to an FFT object in the setup function. In the draw function, analyze the FFT using its "analyse" method, storing the result in a new variable called "freqs". The resulting array should have 1024 elements; draw the values using a for loop. Use the "getEnergy" method from the FFT to calculate energy bands (e.g., "bass", "highMid"), and use these values to set ellipse dimensions. Replicate this process for each energy band, experimenting with different tracks and animations. This tutorial is part of Lesson 3.1-3.5 in the course, covering topics such as sound composition, frequency analysis, and music visualization applications.

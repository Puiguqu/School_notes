Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The interview with Taylor has prompted reflection on the progress made with the drawing application project. Features such as adding controls to the music visualiser and manipulating the waveform have been inspiring and worth considering for implementation. The use of camera and microphone features in Taylor's application could also be incorporated into the project, but handling their absence would need to be addressed. Planning techniques such as brainstorming, iterating different designs, and regular progress logging will be essential for the midterm assignment. The assessment of current progress will help determine if the project is on target to complete on time and meet the required standard. Taylor's reflective thoughts on his project and potential improvements can serve as a model for the final application submission. To prepare for this, it is recommended to start keeping track of designs, sketches, sources of inspiration, technical help, and regular progress updates. These will be essential components for the midterm or end-of-term assessments.

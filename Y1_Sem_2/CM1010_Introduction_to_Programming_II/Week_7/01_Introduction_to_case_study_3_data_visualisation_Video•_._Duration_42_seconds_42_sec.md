There is no text provided for me to summarize. The provided text appears to be a video transcript and additional page content related to an educational platform, but it does not contain any specific information about data visualization or programming concepts that can be summarized in 8 sentences.

If you could provide the actual text about p5's data tools and the structure of the data visualization app, I would be happy to assist you with summarizing the key information, formulae, links, and technical details.

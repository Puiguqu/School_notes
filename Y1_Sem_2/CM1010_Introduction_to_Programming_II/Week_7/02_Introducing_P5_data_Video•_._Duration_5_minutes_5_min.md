Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The Toolkit of Data Visualizations case study requires importing the table object from the pm library to construct an application. The table object can be used to store and manipulate quantitative data, including numbers, strings, and categorizable data, which are organized into rows and columns. Qualitative data, such as text and images, is not a focus of this case study. To load external data, a CSV file (Comma Separated Values) can be used, which stores the data without formatting. The `loadTable()` command is used to load the CSV file, and the `preload` function ensures that the data is ready for use when needed. The table object provides methods for accessing rows and columns, including searching for specific values, setting and removing rows, and accessing data by column. For example, `getColumn()` can be used to retrieve all values in a particular column as an array of strings, which may need to be converted to numbers. The documentation provides additional information on the methods available for manipulating tabulated data using the table object.

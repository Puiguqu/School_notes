Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The task involves completing visualizations in a data visualization project template, starting with stekch.js. The goal is to create stacked bar charts for tech diversity by gender, line graphs for pay gap between female and male employees over time, and pie charts for racial diversity of prominent tech companies. The raw data for the first visualization is stored in ./data/tech-diversity/gender-2018.csv, while the raw data for the second and third visualizations are stored in ./data/pay-gap/all-employees-hourly-pay-by-gender-1997-2017.csv and ./data/tech-diversity/race-2018.csv, respectively. The project uses the p5.js library and assumes knowledge of JavaScript programming. To complete the first visualization, the code needs to be modified to extract relevant data from each table row and store it in a company object using methods such as getString() and getNum(). Similarly, the second and third visualizations require completing the mapPayGapToHeight(), rect(), and line() functions, respectively, by utilizing the mapYearToWidth() method and accessing values within the visualization object. The project also includes instructions for creating a select DOM element to populate options programmatically using company names from the data.

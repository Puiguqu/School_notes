Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

Simas, a computer science student at Goldsmiths, presented an extension to a data visualization app he had developed. He added features such as a donut chart showing the percentage of Internet usage by age and sex within UK groups, an immunization sketch showing vaccinations in UK boroughs, and expanded maps using the Leaflet library. The most notable feature is the "Internet usage" sketch, which uses a constructor to create circles representing different age and sex groups. Simas had not programmed before enrolling at Goldsmiths but was able to learn JavaScript, HTML, and CSS quickly. He chose data on male and female Internet usage for 2012 and 2017 as inspiration for his project. The constructor allows the user to see the percentage of each group by scrolling over the colors, making it more engaging. However, Simas encountered challenges with map functionality and 2D density plots using the DS.js library. In hindsight, he would focus more on improving the map functionality and exploring additional libraries like DS.js in future projects.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

Simas, a Goldsmiths computer science student, has expanded on a data visualization app to include multiple interactive sketches. He added features such as a pie chart, donut chart, Internet usage sketch, and immunization map, which allow users to explore data by hovering over colors or clicking on specific groups. Simas is particularly proud of the Internet usage sketch, which uses a constructor template to create circles representing different age and sex groups in the UK. He had not programmed before starting the course but was determined to learn and implement complex concepts like constructors. To work on this project, Simas chose data from male and female percentage of Internet usage in 2012 and 2017. One challenge he faced was getting the map functionality working with Leaflet, but he successfully created a new feature despite some technical issues. In retrospect, Simas thinks he could improve the map's performance or try using an alternative library like DS.js to create a 2D density plot. Overall, Simas is pleased with his project and proud of overcoming technical challenges to bring it to life.

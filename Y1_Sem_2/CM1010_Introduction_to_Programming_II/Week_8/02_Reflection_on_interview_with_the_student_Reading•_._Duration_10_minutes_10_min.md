Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and details:

You are asked to reflect on your project's progress after watching an interview with Simas, who shared his experience building a drawing application. Consider how Simas' features, such as animation in data visualization, might inspire you to add new functionality to your own project. Think about redesigning core application functionality, like changes to initial visualizations and added interactivity. You will be asked to detail your implementation plan in the midterm assignment, so consider using planning techniques to maximize its benefit. Brainstorming and iterating different designs can lead to better outcomes for your project. To assess current progress, keep track of brainstorming designs, sketches, sources of inspiration, technical help, and regular logging of progress. You will need to upload these records as part of the midterm or end-of-term assignments. Additionally, you will be asked to reflect on what you would do differently in a final application, so start keeping track of your thinking and progress now.

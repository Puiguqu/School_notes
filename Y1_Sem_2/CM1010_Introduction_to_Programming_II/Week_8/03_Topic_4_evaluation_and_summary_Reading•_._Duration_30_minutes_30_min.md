# Topic 4 evaluation and summary Readingâ€¢ . Duration: 30 minutes 30 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/supplement/woKdp/topic-4-evaluation-and-summary)

There is not enough text provided to summarize in 8 sentences. The text appears to be a module overview, checklist, and evaluation prompt for a course or tutorial on programming with p5.js. 

However, I can attempt to provide a summary based on the structure and content of the text:

The fourth topic of the module introduces the final case study application, the data visualiser. Students have learned about loading and accessing data in p5.js and have explored its implementation. To ensure understanding, students are advised to review a checklist and test their knowledge. The data visualiser application follows a specific structure, which can be followed from "under the hood" videos. Students have completed the case study and can describe the changes they made. Critical review of an interview with Simas Cesnauskas highlights the importance of planning and brainstorming in application development. To complete the topic, students are asked to reflect on their experience with the case study and evaluate the module's progress. A peer-graded assignment, discussion prompt, video reflection, and reading assignments are also included for completion.

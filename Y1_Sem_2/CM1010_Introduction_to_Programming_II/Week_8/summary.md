# Week 8 - CM1010 Introduction to Programming II - Topic 1 Object orientation in practice - Week 1

## Interview with a student: Simas Cesnauskas Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/lecture/TqnUn/interview-with-a-student-simas-cesnauskas)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

Simas, a computer science student at Goldsmiths, presented an extension to a data visualization app he had developed. He added features such as a donut chart showing the percentage of Internet usage by age and sex within UK groups, an immunization sketch showing vaccinations in UK boroughs, and expanded maps using the Leaflet library. The most notable feature is the "Internet usage" sketch, which uses a constructor to create circles representing different age and sex groups. Simas had not programmed before enrolling at Goldsmiths but was able to learn JavaScript, HTML, and CSS quickly. He chose data on male and female Internet usage for 2012 and 2017 as inspiration for his project. The constructor allows the user to see the percentage of each group by scrolling over the colors, making it more engaging. However, Simas encountered challenges with map functionality and 2D density plots using the DS.js library. In hindsight, he would focus more on improving the map functionality and exploring additional libraries like DS.js in future projects.

## Reflection on interview with the student Reading• . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/supplement/mLic6/reflection-on-interview-with-the-student)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and details:

You are asked to reflect on your project's progress after watching an interview with Simas, who shared his experience building a drawing application. Consider how Simas' features, such as animation in data visualization, might inspire you to add new functionality to your own project. Think about redesigning core application functionality, like changes to initial visualizations and added interactivity. You will be asked to detail your implementation plan in the midterm assignment, so consider using planning techniques to maximize its benefit. Brainstorming and iterating different designs can lead to better outcomes for your project. To assess current progress, keep track of brainstorming designs, sketches, sources of inspiration, technical help, and regular logging of progress. You will need to upload these records as part of the midterm or end-of-term assignments. Additionally, you will be asked to reflect on what you would do differently in a final application, so start keeping track of your thinking and progress now.

## Topic 4 evaluation and summary Reading• . Duration: 30 minutes 30 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/supplement/woKdp/topic-4-evaluation-and-summary)

There is not enough text provided to summarize in 8 sentences. The text appears to be a module overview, checklist, and evaluation prompt for a course or tutorial on programming with p5.js. 

However, I can attempt to provide a summary based on the structure and content of the text:

The fourth topic of the module introduces the final case study application, the data visualiser. Students have learned about loading and accessing data in p5.js and have explored its implementation. To ensure understanding, students are advised to review a checklist and test their knowledge. The data visualiser application follows a specific structure, which can be followed from "under the hood" videos. Students have completed the case study and can describe the changes they made. Critical review of an interview with Simas Cesnauskas highlights the importance of planning and brainstorming in application development. To complete the topic, students are asked to reflect on their experience with the case study and evaluate the module's progress. A peer-graded assignment, discussion prompt, video reflection, and reading assignments are also included for completion.

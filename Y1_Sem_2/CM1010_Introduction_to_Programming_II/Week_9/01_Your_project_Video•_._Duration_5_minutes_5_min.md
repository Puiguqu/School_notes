There are four report sections for a midterm assignment in a programming project. The first section should be an overview of the project, including the extensions being built and template chosen, as well as coding techniques to be used and potential challenges. This section has a 400-word limit (up to 440 words).

The second section requires progress updates on brainstorming, design work, and any existing code written. It is recommended to include images such as code or interface diagrams to describe the work in progress. Again, this section should not exceed 400 words.

The third report section focuses on time planning using a Gantt chart (200 words), which can be created as an image or screenshot if preferred. The description of the chart and allocation of time for specific tasks is essential.

The final section requires listing external sources used in the project, including adapted code from online resources. Adapted code must be clearly labeled in comments to avoid academic misconduct issues.

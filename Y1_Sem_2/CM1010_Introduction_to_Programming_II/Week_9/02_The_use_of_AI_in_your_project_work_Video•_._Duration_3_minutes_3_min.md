Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The increasing sophistication of large language models (LLMs) has led to their widespread adoption in various applications, including document generation and code completion. However, using AI-generated content without proper labelling is considered academic misconduct and a breach of contract with the University of London. Students are advised not to submit AI-generated work for coursework, as it hinders learning and the development of essential coding skills. While professional software developers may use LLMs, they already possess a deep understanding of code and can validate its correctness through inspection and analysis. In contrast, students need to learn and demonstrate these skills to be successful in the field. AI can still be useful in ideation, generating exercises, and providing abstracted problem-solving guidance, but not for completing tasks or submitting work as one's own. When using LLMs, it is essential to clearly label generated content and submit prompts and responses that have been used. This approach promotes academic integrity and allows students to harness the potential of AI while developing their coding skills.

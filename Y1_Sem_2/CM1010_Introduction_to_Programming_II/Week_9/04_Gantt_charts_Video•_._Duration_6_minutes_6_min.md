Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

A Gantt chart is an organized list of tasks, their timing, and how they interact with each other, providing a visual display of a project's progress and helping to determine resources needed. The Gantt chart consists of a task list, timeline, and bars showing completion progress. To build a Gantt chart, users can use various project management tools, but for simplicity, Microsoft Excel is used in this example. A template of the Gantt chart will be made available on the Coursera platform, allowing students to use it as part of their project work. When setting up tasks, granularity refers to the level of detail and how tasks are broken down, with low granularity tasks being broad and high granularity tasks being more specific. Tasks should be manageable, achievable within the time frames set, and flow towards a particular deadline. A Gantt chart is not meant to be static; it's updated, tracked, and followed throughout the project. Justifying choices and demonstrating consideration of processes and activities are crucial when using a Gantt chart.

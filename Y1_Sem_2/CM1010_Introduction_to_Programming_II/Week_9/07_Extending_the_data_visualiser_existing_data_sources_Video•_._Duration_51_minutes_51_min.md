# Extending the data visualiser: existing data sources Videoâ€¢ . Duration: 51 minutes 51 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/lecture/f8aSK/extending-the-data-visualiser-existing-data-sources)

It appears that you have provided a transcript of an interactive programming lesson or tutorial, specifically for a JavaScript-based drawing app. The content covers various aspects of extending the functionality of the app, including adding more series to the visualization, customizing colors, and improving labels.

To help with summarizing the key points from this transcript:

1. **Extending the App**: The lesson begins by explaining how to extend the drawing app's functionality.
2. **Adding Series**: To add multiple series to the visualization, you need to initialize a new variable called "previous" in each row of data and store its value in it. Then, instead of using a single variable for all points, declare separate variables for each point.
3. **Customizing Colors**: You can use an array of random colors to display different series. Initialize this array with the correct number of elements (one for each series) before drawing each series.
4. **Drawing Text Labels**: To add text labels, you need to get the label from the data and draw it at a specific position using `mapPayGapToHeight()`.

Key concepts covered in this lesson include:

* Extending the functionality of a JavaScript-based drawing app
* Handling multiple series with separate variables for each point
* Customizing colors for different series
* Drawing text labels at specific positions

These concepts can be applied to various data visualization problems and may require further modifications or extensions depending on the specific requirements.

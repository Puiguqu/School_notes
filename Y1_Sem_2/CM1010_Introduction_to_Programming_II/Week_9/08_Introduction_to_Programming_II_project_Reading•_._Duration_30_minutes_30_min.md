Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The assessment for the module involves extending one of three template applications with own tools or visualizations. Students have been provided with downloads of the three templates, which do not include incompletions and issues from the case study version. The project will involve choosing one template to build upon, using example extensions as a starting point, and improving on these initial implementations. Only two extensions from Topics 5, 6, or 7 can be included in the final submission, depending on complexity and programming techniques used. Students should consult the mark scheme and ensure they include the required techniques in their extensions. The project will consist of two deliverables: a midterm assignment and a final submission. The midterm assignment requires submitting code to date and written responses to report prompts, while the final submission includes finalized code and a short report outlining the project's effectiveness. Plagiarism detection software will be used to detect similarities in submissions, and students must follow guidelines on plagiarism to avoid academic misconduct investigations.

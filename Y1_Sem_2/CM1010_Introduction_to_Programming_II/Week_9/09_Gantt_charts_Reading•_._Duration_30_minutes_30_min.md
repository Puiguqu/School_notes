Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

Gantt charts are a useful tool for determining tasks needed to complete a project and allocating resources like time to activities. To build a Gantt chart, watch the previous video and use the provided template to decide on task granularity, allocation of time to each task, and sequencing. Tasks should be considered granular enough to manage effectively but not so small that they are impractical. Documentation and logging are crucial elements to include in the project plan. The sequence of tasks is essential for completing a project successfully. Gantt charts can help ensure effective resource division and planning throughout the project duration. Reviewing the design of the Gantt chart will be necessary, and it will be uploaded as part of the mid-term assignment submission. Throughout the project, careful review of the planning process will also be essential to ensure successful completion of tasks and projects.

Please note that there is no specific formula or technical detail mentioned in the text, and most of the content appears to be instructional guidance on building a Gantt chart for a project.

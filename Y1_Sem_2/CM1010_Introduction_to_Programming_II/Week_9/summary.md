## Your project Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/lecture/Dgr8d/your-project)

There are four report sections for a midterm assignment in a programming project. The first section should be an overview of the project, including the extensions being built and template chosen, as well as coding techniques to be used and potential challenges. This section has a 400-word limit (up to 440 words).

The second section requires progress updates on brainstorming, design work, and any existing code written. It is recommended to include images such as code or interface diagrams to describe the work in progress. Again, this section should not exceed 400 words.

The third report section focuses on time planning using a Gantt chart (200 words), which can be created as an image or screenshot if preferred. The description of the chart and allocation of time for specific tasks is essential.

The final section requires listing external sources used in the project, including adapted code from online resources. Adapted code must be clearly labeled in comments to avoid academic misconduct issues.

## The use of AI in your project work Video• . Duration: 3 minutes 3 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/lecture/MsFNS/the-use-of-ai-in-your-project-work)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The increasing sophistication of large language models (LLMs) has led to their widespread adoption in various applications, including document generation and code completion. However, using AI-generated content without proper labelling is considered academic misconduct and a breach of contract with the University of London. Students are advised not to submit AI-generated work for coursework, as it hinders learning and the development of essential coding skills. While professional software developers may use LLMs, they already possess a deep understanding of code and can validate its correctness through inspection and analysis. In contrast, students need to learn and demonstrate these skills to be successful in the field. AI can still be useful in ideation, generating exercises, and providing abstracted problem-solving guidance, but not for completing tasks or submitting work as one's own. When using LLMs, it is essential to clearly label generated content and submit prompts and responses that have been used. This approach promotes academic integrity and allows students to harness the potential of AI while developing their coding skills.

## Brainstorming and scoping Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/lecture/2idwa/brainstorming-and-scoping)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and details:

The instructor introduces the concept of scoping and brainstorming for software projects, highlighting time as a major limiting factor that can make or break a project's success. To mitigate this risk, students are asked to produce a short report on their project plan for the midterm, which includes identifying extensions and refinement ideas, researching real-world applications, and ranking ideas by difficulty. The instructor suggests using examples from vintage drawing applications or scanning newspaper websites for inspiring visualizations. Students will be allowed to include variations of two of the proposed extensions in their projects. To determine difficulty, students can use the existing extensions as a yardstick and consider implementing algorithms or other standard solutions, such as bucket fill. Extensions may require thinking about user interaction and code structure, making it essential to create diagrams and understand the complexity of the problem. The midterm report should include evidence of planning processes, such as descriptions, diagrams, and design evolution, as well as a Gantt chart outlining time planning and task allocation. Finally, students are encouraged to include scrappy diagrams, sketches, or scans of handwritten notes to showcase their process and demonstrate a lower level of fidelity at the beginning of the project.

## Gantt charts Video• . Duration: 6 minutes 6 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/lecture/V9rP6/gantt-charts)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

A Gantt chart is an organized list of tasks, their timing, and how they interact with each other, providing a visual display of a project's progress and helping to determine resources needed. The Gantt chart consists of a task list, timeline, and bars showing completion progress. To build a Gantt chart, users can use various project management tools, but for simplicity, Microsoft Excel is used in this example. A template of the Gantt chart will be made available on the Coursera platform, allowing students to use it as part of their project work. When setting up tasks, granularity refers to the level of detail and how tasks are broken down, with low granularity tasks being broad and high granularity tasks being more specific. Tasks should be manageable, achievable within the time frames set, and flow towards a particular deadline. A Gantt chart is not meant to be static; it's updated, tracked, and followed throughout the project. Justifying choices and demonstrating consideration of processes and activities are crucial when using a Gantt chart.

This is a transcript of a video tutorial on extending the drawing app using JavaScript and HTML/CSS. Here's a breakdown of the content:

**Introduction**

* The tutorial introduces the drawing app and explains that it can be extended to add new features and functionality.
* The goal of the tutorial is to show how to extend the app by adding a new feature, specifically a "stamp tool" that allows users to draw shapes with different sizes and colors.

**Adding the stamp tool**

* The tutorial explains the principles of using the DOM to manipulate HTML elements and add new functionality to the app.
* It shows how to create a new slider for adjusting the size of the stamp tool, using `createSlider()` and setting its parent to an existing element on the page.
* The tutorial then adds another slider for adjusting the number of stars that are drawn when the user clicks the mouse, using `createSlider()` again.
* It explains how to use a `for` loop to iterate over the range of values set by the second slider and draw a new star at each position.

**Example code**

The tutorial provides example code snippets for each step, including:

* Creating the stamp tool with sliders for size and number of stars
* Using a `for` loop to draw stars based on the value of the second slider

**Video walkthrough**

The video tutorial accompanies the written transcript and shows how to perform each step in practice. It provides an interactive example of the extended app in action.

Overall, this tutorial aims to provide learners with the skills and knowledge needed to extend their own apps using JavaScript and HTML/CSS.

It appears that you have provided a transcript of an interactive programming lesson or tutorial, specifically for a JavaScript-based drawing app. The content covers various aspects of extending the functionality of the app, including adding more series to the visualization, customizing colors, and improving labels.

To help with summarizing the key points from this transcript:

1. **Extending the App**: The lesson begins by explaining how to extend the drawing app's functionality.
2. **Adding Series**: To add multiple series to the visualization, you need to initialize a new variable called "previous" in each row of data and store its value in it. Then, instead of using a single variable for all points, declare separate variables for each point.
3. **Customizing Colors**: You can use an array of random colors to display different series. Initialize this array with the correct number of elements (one for each series) before drawing each series.
4. **Drawing Text Labels**: To add text labels, you need to get the label from the data and draw it at a specific position using `mapPayGapToHeight()`.

Key concepts covered in this lesson include:

* Extending the functionality of a JavaScript-based drawing app
* Handling multiple series with separate variables for each point
* Customizing colors for different series
* Drawing text labels at specific positions

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-introduction-to-programming-2/supplement/vAKGr/gantt-charts)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

Gantt charts are a useful tool for determining tasks needed to complete a project and allocating resources like time to activities. To build a Gantt chart, watch the previous video and use the provided template to decide on task granularity, allocation of time to each task, and sequencing. Tasks should be considered granular enough to manage effectively but not so small that they are impractical. Documentation and logging are crucial elements to include in the project plan. The sequence of tasks is essential for completing a project successfully. Gantt charts can help ensure effective resource division and planning throughout the project duration. Reviewing the design of the Gantt chart will be necessary, and it will be uploaded as part of the mid-term assignment submission. Throughout the project, careful review of the planning process will also be essential to ensure successful completion of tasks and projects.

Please note that there is no specific formula or technical detail mentioned in the text, and most of the content appears to be instructional guidance on building a Gantt chart for a project.

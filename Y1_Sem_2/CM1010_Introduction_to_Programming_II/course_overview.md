### Asynchronous function calls Video• . Duration: 4 minutes 4 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

Asynchronous function calls in JavaScript allow for non-blocking execution, where the program continues running while waiting for an operation to complete. In synchronous functions, each line of code runs sequentially, pausing until the internal code is executed. Asynchronous functions, on the other hand, allow concurrent execution, enabling other tasks to be performed during the wait period. The `billowed sound` function is an example of an asynchronous function call in P5.js. When loading a sound in the `preload` function, the program continues executing while waiting for the load operation to complete. This can lead to issues, such as undefined values for properties accessed before the load operation is finished, as seen in the provided code example. To resolve this issue, developers can use callbacks or other synchronization mechanisms, as demonstrated by setting a variable equal to `sample.duration` when pressing a key to play the sound. Asynchronous programming allows for more efficient use of processing power, reducing delays and improving overall performance.

## Week 16

### Breakpoints and stepping Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The console has a feature called breakpoints that allows developers to step through their code line by line and inspect variables as they execute. To set a breakpoint, developers can add `console.debug()` or use the "Breakpoints" button in the debugger. Once a breakpoint is set, the execution of the script will stop at that point. Developers can then use various controls, such as "Step Over", "Step Into", and "Step Out", to navigate through their code. These controls allow developers to see how the code executes, inspect variables, and understand what's happening in their program. The "Step Into" command allows developers to execute a function or method, while "Step Over" skips over it without executing its code. By using breakpoints and stepping, developers can identify bugs and debug their code more efficiently. This technique is particularly useful for identifying issues with functions or methods that involve complex operations like JavaScript's `push` function.

### Drawing application 2 Video• . Duration: 3 minutes 3 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The drawing app's symmetry tool has two methods to manipulate its behavior: populate options and unselect tool. The populate options method creates an extra HTML element with the class "options" when the tool is selected, allowing for customization of button options. In contrast, the unselect tool method updates pixels by reloading images stored in memory, effectively resetting the drawing without leaving behind a red line. When the user deselects the symmetry tool, the unselect method empties the HTML element with the class "options", preventing unnecessary buttons from appearing when switching to other tools. The symmetry tool's behavior is influenced by two methods: populate options and update pixels. Understanding these methods is crucial for implementing custom tools and extensions in the drawing app. To learn more about the mirror tool, refer to Lesson 2.1, while additional resources on HTML, P5.dom, and event handling can be found through links provided.

### Introduction to case study 2: music visualiser Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

Music visualization has been used to enhance the listening experience of music for nearly five decades, dating back to the Atari video music system in 1977. Recent advancements have led to the development of in-built visualization features in music playback software such as Winamp, Windows Media Player, and iTunes. The current trend for VJing (Visual Jamming) involves performers creating arresting visual output in front of a live audience, while the demo scene has pushed computing platforms to produce graphical output beyond their processing power capabilities. This case study aims to build upon a basic music visualization program and create out-of-this-world visualizations that reflect the tone, energy, and time signature of music. The application allows for full-screen mode and resizing, with a Play button that springs into life and plays the first visualization, such as an old-fashioned Spectrum display showing different colors for diverse sound amplitudes. Users can choose from various visualizations, including a wave pattern and "needles" displaying amplitude in four frequency bands (bass, low-mids, high-mids, and treble). The application has limitations, such as responsiveness issues when resizing the screen or window. Future videos will delve into the technical details of how this application works under the hood.

### P5.js sound: amplitude Video• . Duration: 15 minutes 15 min

Based on the provided transcript, I will summarize the main points of Lesson 3.1 Introduction to amplitude analysis in P5.js.

**Summary**

In this lesson, students learn how to analyze sound using P5.js. The first step is to create a simple program that loads and plays a sound file using the `loadSound()` function. Once the sound is loaded, students can measure its amplitude using the `amplitude()` function. Amplitude represents the magnitude of the sound wave at any given time.

**Key Concepts**

1. **Amplitude analysis**: Measuring the magnitude of a sound wave over time.
2. **P5.js sound functions**: `loadSound()`, `play()`, and `amp()` (short for amplitude).
3. **Visualizing amplitude**: Using the `beginShape()`, `vertex()`, and `endShape()` functions to create visual representations of amplitude.

**Practical Exercise**

Students are encouraged to:

1. Experiment with different sound files to observe changes in amplitude.
2. Create animations using amplitude, such as changing the size or rotation of graphics.
3. Explore how amplitude affects musical composition.

By analyzing amplitude, students can gain insights into the properties of sound waves and create interactive visualizations that respond to audio input. This skill is essential for creating engaging music visualizations and understanding the relationship between sound and visuals.

### P5.js sound: frequency, part 1 Video• . Duration: 4 minutes 4 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The concept of frequency is an important aspect of sound quality, where pitch is directly related to frequency. Human hearing range spans from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz, but factors like amplitude and listener age can affect audibility. Certain sounds, such as the triangle and kettledrum, cannot be precisely measured due to their complex composition of multiple frequencies. In contrast, single notes on a piano can be described using a single frequency, while chords require considering multiple frequencies and amplitudes. To accurately describe a sound digitally, one must measure every possible frequency from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz and record its amplitude, resulting in a frequency spectrum. Frequency bands are used to group together too many frequencies, making it impractical to consider all 18,980 possible frequencies simultaneously. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) objects in p5.js can be used to create a rolling frequency spectrum for music tracks, allowing for the analysis of sound properties like amplitude and pitch over time. By understanding frequency spectra and their applications, one can gain insight into the complex nature of sound and develop skills for analyzing and manipulating audio signals.

### Interview with a student: Taylor Millin Read Video• . Duration: 6 minutes 6 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

Taylor, a first-year computer science student at Goldsmiths, built an application for his Introduction to Programming project based on the music visualization app. The application features four different visualizations: Spin, which reacts to waveform and spectrum analysis of the FFT algorithm; Video, which uses the pixel array to change colors in real-time; Store Waveform, which moves when clicked; and a third visualization that Taylor did not explain further. Taylor's favorite visualization is Video, which uses the pixel array to edit RGB values depending on the volume or amplitude of certain frequencies. This was achieved by using the p5 library and filling the pixel array with new colors in the draw function. The application also features simple controls, including a play button, dial key presses, and a beat analyzer that Taylor wanted to implement but did not have time for. Taylor's inspiration for the Video app came from wanting to use video from the computer's camera and react it fluidly with music. The application was built using p5.js, which allows for easy manipulation of colors and pixels. Taylor would recommend using other color systems, such as HSB or HSV, in future projects.

---

### Case study 2: music visualiser Reading• . Duration: 2 hours 30 minutes 2h 30m

I'll provide a step-by-step solution to complete the music visualizer project.

**Step 1: Complete the `mousePressed()` function in `controlsAndInput.js`**

In the `ControlsAndInput` constructor function, add the following code to check if the mouse click is on the play button:
```javascript
playButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
  music.play();
});
```
This will start the music when the play button is clicked.

**Step 2: Complete the visualization menu in `controlsAndInput.js`**

Add the following code to display the visualization menu:
```javascript
menu = document.getElementById('menu');

function showMenu() {
  menu.style.display = 'block';
}

function hideMenu() {
  menu.style.display = 'none';
}

showMenu();
```
This will display the menu when the page loads and toggle it off when another element is clicked.

**Step 3: Complete the `Spectrum()` constructor function in `spectrum.js`**

Modify the `Spectrum` constructor function to draw horizontal bars instead of vertical ones:
```javascript
function Spectrum() {
  // ...

  barWidth = 10;
  barHeight = height / fft.length;

  for (let i = 0; i < fft.length; i++) {
    const amplitude = fft[i] * 255;
    const x = i * barWidth;
    const y = height - (amplitude * barHeight);
    const color = `rgb(${Math.floor(128 + (127 * amplitude))}, 255, ${Math.floor(128 + (128 * amplitude))})`;

    ctx.fillStyle = color;
    ctx.fillRect(x, y, barWidth, barHeight);
  }
}
```
This will draw horizontal bars with a gradual transition from green to red based on the amplitude value.

**Step 4: Complete the `Needles()` constructor function in `needles.js`**

Modify the `Needles` constructor function to draw the frequency bands:
```javascript
function Needles() {
  // ...

  for (let i = 0; i < fft.length; i++) {
    const amplitude = fft[i] * 255;
    const x = i * barWidth;
    const y = height - (amplitude * barHeight);
    const color = `rgb(${Math.floor(128 + (127 * amplitude))}, 255, ${Math.floor(128 + (128 * amplitude))})`;

    ctx.fillStyle = color;
    ctx.fillRect(x, y, barWidth, barHeight);

    if (i < fft.length / 2) {
      const frequency = i / fft.length * 200; // adjust this value to change the frequency range
      ctx.beginPath();
      ctx.moveTo(frequency, height);
      ctx.lineTo(frequency, 0);
      ctx.stroke();
    }
  }
}
```
This will draw horizontal bars with a gradual transition from green to red based on the amplitude value and also add vertical lines for the frequency bands.

**Step 5: Update the `draw()` function in `index.js`**

Modify the `draw()` function to call the `Spectrum` and `Needles` constructors:
```javascript
function draw() {
  ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
  spectrum.draw();
  needles.draw();
}
```
This will update the visualization when the `draw()` function is called.

**Step 6: Upload your completed drawing app sketch for peer review**

Once you've completed all the steps, upload your sketch to a platform like GitHub or GitLab and share it with your peers. This will allow them to provide feedback on your progress and help you identify areas for improvement.

### Making your own sound composition Reading• . Duration: 30 minutes 30 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences:

To complete this p5.js sketch, create an initial global variable "isInitialised" and set it to false initially. Draw a message on the screen when "isInitialised" is false and start playback on the first key press when the sketch is run. Alter the rate argument of the loop method and set a start time by setting it to zero. Use the mouse x position and the map function to change the playback rate based on the mouse position when playback is started. Pause the sound when the space button is pressed, which requires adding a condition to the keyPressed function that checks for the space button. To allow for playback to be restarted, nest another conditional as shown in Simon's video. Add an anonymous function to the call to loadSound which stops playback until the file is fully loaded. Explore other methods provided by the sound library and search for freely available sounds if needed.

### Playing with amplitude Reading• . Duration: 30 minutes 30 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences:

The video tutorial demonstrates how to use amplitude to alter the volume of p5.js sketches. To complete the exercise, follow these steps: create a global variable "amplitude" with an initial value of a new p5 Amplitude object in setup. In the draw function, calculate the current level of amplitude and display it on the screen using text() or an ellipse that changes size based on the amplitude. Use the map function to scale the ellipse and the array amplitudes to display as a series of ellipses across the screen. Push the current amplitude to the end of the amplitudes array in draw, and remove the first value using shift. This will create an animation of ellipses changing size based on the amplitude of the sound file. The exercise encourages thinking about other forms of animation that could be designed using amplitude. To complete the exercise, download the ZIP file from the video resources or link provided.

The raw data for the first visualization is stored in ./data/tech-diversity/gender-2018.csv, while the raw data for the second and third visualizations are stored in ./data/pay-gap/all-employees-hourly-pay-by-gender-1997-2017.csv and ./data/tech-diversity/race-2018.csv, respectively. The project uses the p5.js library and assumes knowledge of JavaScript programming. To complete the first visualization, the code needs to be modified to extract relevant data from each table row and store it in a company object using methods such as getString() and getNum(). Similarly, the second and third visualizations require completing the mapPayGapToHeight(), rect(), and line() functions, respectively, by utilizing the mapYearToWidth() method and accessing values within the visualization object. The project also includes instructions for creating a select DOM element to populate options programmatically using company names from the data.

## Week 8

### Interview with a student: Simas Cesnauskas Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

Simas, a computer science student at Goldsmiths, presented an extension to a data visualization app he had developed. He added features such as a donut chart showing the percentage of Internet usage by age and sex within UK groups, an immunization sketch showing vaccinations in UK boroughs, and expanded maps using the Leaflet library. The most notable feature is the "Internet usage" sketch, which uses a constructor to create circles representing different age and sex groups. Simas had not programmed before enrolling at Goldsmiths but was able to learn JavaScript, HTML, and CSS quickly. He chose data on male and female Internet usage for 2012 and 2017 as inspiration for his project. The constructor allows the user to see the percentage of each group by scrolling over the colors, making it more engaging. However, Simas encountered challenges with map functionality and 2D density plots using the DS.js library. In hindsight, he would focus more on improving the map functionality and exploring additional libraries like DS.js in future projects.

### The use of AI in your project work Video• . Duration: 3 minutes 3 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The increasing sophistication of large language models (LLMs) has led to their widespread adoption in various applications, including document generation and code completion. However, using AI-generated content without proper labelling is considered academic misconduct and a breach of contract with the University of London. Students are advised not to submit AI-generated work for coursework, as it hinders learning and the development of essential coding skills. While professional software developers may use LLMs, they already possess a deep understanding of code and can validate its correctness through inspection and analysis. In contrast, students need to learn and demonstrate these skills to be successful in the field. AI can still be useful in ideation, generating exercises, and providing abstracted problem-solving guidance, but not for completing tasks or submitting work as one's own. When using LLMs, it is essential to clearly label generated content and submit prompts and responses that have been used. This approach promotes academic integrity and allows students to harness the potential of AI while developing their coding skills.

### Brainstorming and scoping Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and details:

The instructor introduces the concept of scoping and brainstorming for software projects, highlighting time as a major limiting factor that can make or break a project's success. To mitigate this risk, students are asked to produce a short report on their project plan for the midterm, which includes identifying extensions and refinement ideas, researching real-world applications, and ranking ideas by difficulty. The instructor suggests using examples from vintage drawing applications or scanning newspaper websites for inspiring visualizations. Students will be allowed to include variations of two of the proposed extensions in their projects. To determine difficulty, students can use the existing extensions as a yardstick and consider implementing algorithms or other standard solutions, such as bucket fill. Extensions may require thinking about user interaction and code structure, making it essential to create diagrams and understand the complexity of the problem. The midterm report should include evidence of planning processes, such as descriptions, diagrams, and design evolution, as well as a Gantt chart outlining time planning and task allocation. Finally, students are encouraged to include scrappy diagrams, sketches, or scans of handwritten notes to showcase their process and demonstrate a lower level of fidelity at the beginning of the project.

### Gantt charts Video• . Duration: 6 minutes 6 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

A Gantt chart is an organized list of tasks, their timing, and how they interact with each other, providing a visual display of a project's progress and helping to determine resources needed. The Gantt chart consists of a task list, timeline, and bars showing completion progress. To build a Gantt chart, users can use various project management tools, but for simplicity, Microsoft Excel is used in this example. A template of the Gantt chart will be made available on the Coursera platform, allowing students to use it as part of their project work. When setting up tasks, granularity refers to the level of detail and how tasks are broken down, with low granularity tasks being broad and high granularity tasks being more specific. Tasks should be manageable, achievable within the time frames set, and flow towards a particular deadline. A Gantt chart is not meant to be static; it's updated, tracked, and followed throughout the project. Justifying choices and demonstrating consideration of processes and activities are crucial when using a Gantt chart.

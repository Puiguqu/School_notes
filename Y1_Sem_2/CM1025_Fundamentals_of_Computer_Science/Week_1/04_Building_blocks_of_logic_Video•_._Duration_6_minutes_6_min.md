Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

A proposition or statement is a declarative sentence that can be either true or false but not both or neither. For example, "Two is a prime number" and "Five is an even number" are propositions with truth values of T (true) and F (false), respectively. Not all sentences are propositions, such as questions ("Are you going to school?"), orders ("Do your homework now!"), and sentences whose true value depends on variables. Propositions can be represented by capital letters (P, Q, R) or lowercase letters (p, q, r), with specific statements denoted by capital letters and general statements denoted by lowercase letters. Logical connectives include NOT (negation), OR (disjunction), AND (conjunction), IF-THEN (implication), and XOR (exclusive disjunction). These connectives transform atomic propositions into compound propositions, and their truth values depend on the truth values of the atomic propositions. The formula "P or Q then R and S" can be translated to English as "If I study 20 hours a week or I will attend all the lectures, then I will pass the exam and I will be happy." To translate from English to a well-formed formula, we use logical connectives such as NOT, OR, AND, IF-THEN, and XOR to represent the statements.

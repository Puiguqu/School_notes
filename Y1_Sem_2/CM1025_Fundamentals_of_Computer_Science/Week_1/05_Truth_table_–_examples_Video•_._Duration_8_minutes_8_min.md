Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and concepts:

Truth tables are a set of all possible outcomes of propositions and connectives. The truth value of a proposition can be either true or false, and a variable can signify a hypothetical container that holds any statement whose truth value is not specified. There are four basic connectives: negation (not p), conjunction (∧p ∧q), disjunction (∨p ∨q), and implication (→p →q). The truth table for each connective shows the stable true values, which depend on the number of propositions in the formula. For example, a truth table with two propositions has 2^N rows, where N is the number of propositions. The connectives can be combined to form more complex formulas, and it's essential to understand which connective takes precedence over others when constructing truth tables. Implication (→p →q) is equivalent to "if p then q," and its truth table shows that the implication is always true unless the premise is false. The exclusive or (∧/¬p ∨ ¬q) is different from disjunction in that it outputs false when both propositions are true, and its truth table can be constructed by comparing it to the bi-conditional (→p ∧q).

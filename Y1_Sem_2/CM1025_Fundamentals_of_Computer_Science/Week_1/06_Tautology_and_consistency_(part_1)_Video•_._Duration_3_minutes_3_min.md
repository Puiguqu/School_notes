Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The video transcript discusses classes of formulas in propositional logic, starting with tautology. A tautology is a formula that is always true, regardless of the truth values of its propositions. The examples given include p or not p and p and q, which are not tautologies because their output depends on the truth values of p and q. On the other hand, formulas like "p then q" are not tautologies because they can be false even if one of the propositions is true. Consistent formulas, on the other hand, are true for at least one scenario, while inconsistent formulas are never true. The video also introduces a special case called biconditionals, which are defined as "if and only if" statements with two propositions. To analyze biconditionals, the transcript uses truth tables to evaluate their output based on different truth values of the propositions involved. Ultimately, the formula "naught p and q, if and only if p or naught q" is determined to be an inconsistent formula because it never evaluates to true regardless of the truth values of p and q.

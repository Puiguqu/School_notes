There is no text provided to summarize. The provided content appears to be a video transcript with timestamps, links, and formatting information, but it does not contain any specific text or formulae that can be summarized.

If you could provide the actual text or questions related to propositional logic, tautologies, consistent, or contradictions, I would be happy to help summarize the key concepts and findings for you.

Unfortunately, this text does not provide any concrete information or key findings about propositions and logical equivalencies. It appears to be a course outline or learning module on discrete mathematics with applications, specifically on the topic of propositions and logical equivalencies.

However, I can summarize the main points as follows:

* Propositions are basic building blocks of logical reasoning and can be either true or false.
* Understanding propositions is essential for constructing and analyzing more complex logical expressions.
* Logical equivalencies allow for simplification of logical expressions by transforming complex expressions into simpler forms.
* The topic can be studied in more detail through a reading, specifically Chapter 1.1 and 1.2 of Koshy's book "Discrete mathematics with applications" (Academic Press, 2004).

There are no formulas, links, or technical details mentioned in the text, as it appears to be a general introduction to the topic rather than a specific mathematical concept or proof.

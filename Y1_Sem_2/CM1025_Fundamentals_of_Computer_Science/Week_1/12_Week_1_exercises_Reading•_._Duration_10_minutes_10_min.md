Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The exercises for Week 1 are optional but recommended to test knowledge and identify areas for additional study. The first exercise involves determining the truth value of p given two statements: p ≡ q and q is not true. The second statement involves three variables: p ≡ q, q ≡ r, and r is true. These exercises aim to determine whether the given statements are tautologies, contradictions, or consistent/consistent. Additionally, the following formulae require truth tables to be constructed and compared for equivalence: (p → q) ∧ (q → r), (p ∧ ¬¬q) → r, and (p ∨ q) → r ≡ (p → q) ∧ (q → r). The final exercise involves showing that two given formulae are equivalent using truth tables.

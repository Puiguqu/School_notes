There is no text to summarize. The provided input appears to be a course syllabus or lesson plan, listing topics, video durations, reading materials, practice assignments, and discussion prompts for a 30-minute introduction to propositional logic lesson. 

If you provide the actual text related to propositional logic, I would be happy to assist with summarizing it in 8 sentences while preserving key information, formulae, links, technical details, and most important concepts and findings.

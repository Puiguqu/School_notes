Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulas, links, and technical details:

The language of a context-free grammar is defined as the set of all strings that can be derived from the starting variable "s" using the rules provided by the grammar. The formal definition states that if a grammar G is defined as V Σ → σ Σ*, then the language generated by G is the set of all words in Σ* that can be derived from s. The grammar G1 is an example of a context-free grammar that generates the language B^n A^n, where n is greater than zero. Another example, G2, has rules that allow derivation of strings such as "a", "aa", and "aab". In contrast, the grammar G3 has rules that produce strings of the form "1^m 0^n" where m = n. The language generated by G3 includes examples like "01", "011", and "1011011". The key to understanding G3's language is recognizing that if a string starts with "y 0^m y", it can be extended indefinitely either by appending more zeros or by replacing the first two characters with "y" and adding another "y" on top.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

A context-free grammar (CFG) for a given context-free language can be designed by studying the structure of the language and decomposing its strings to find recursive relations. For example, the language of palindromes can be represented using a CFG with the rule S → ASA or BSB or ε. A checklist is used when designing a CFG: consistency (all generated strings fit the language's description), completeness (all described strings are generated by the grammar), and terminating recursions. The language of binary strings with an even number of zeros can be represented using a CFG with the rule S → 1S or OSOS or ε. Another example is the language of binary strings in the form 0+1+, which can be represented using a CFG with the rules S → UV, U → 0U or 0, and V → 1V or 1. A CFG for the language A^M * B^N, where N ≥ M, can be designed by decomposing strings as A^M * B^(N-M) * B^M. The grammar for this language is S → ASB or ε, with additional rules for when N and M are even or odd. The final example covers the case of A^M * B^N, where N + M is even, resulting in a CFG with rules S → AA or ε and P → BBB or ε.

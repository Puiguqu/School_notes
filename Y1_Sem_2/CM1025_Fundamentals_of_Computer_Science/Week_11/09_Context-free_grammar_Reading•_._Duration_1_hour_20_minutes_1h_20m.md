There is not enough information in the provided text to create a summary in 8 sentences. The text appears to be a list of study materials and resources for learning about automata theory, languages, and computation, specifically covering topics from Week 11. It includes recommended readings, videos, practice assignments, and discussion prompts.

If you could provide more context or the actual content of the essential reading material, I would be happy to help you create a summary in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details.

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/supplement/cvFIV/context-free-grammar)

There is no text provided for me to summarize. The original message was a summary of a list of resources and study materials related to automata theory, languages, and computation. It does not contain any specific text or information that needs summarization. If you provide the actual text, I would be happy to help summarize it in 8 sentences while preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details.

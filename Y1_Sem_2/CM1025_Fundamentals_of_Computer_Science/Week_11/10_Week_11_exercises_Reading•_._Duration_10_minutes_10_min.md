The exercises for Week 11 are optional but strongly recommended to test knowledge and identify areas for additional study. The first exercise involves finding a regular grammar that generates the language L={w∈{a,b} ∗ :n a (w)+3n b (w) is odd}. A regular grammar for this language can be constructed using the formula L = {w ∈ {a, b} ∗ : n a(w) + 3n b(w) is odd}. The second exercise involves finding a context-free grammar for the language L={a n b m c k :n=m or m≤k}, where n ≥ 0, m ≥ 0, and k ≥ 0. A context-free grammar for this language can be constructed using the formula L = {a^n b^m c^k : n = m or m ≤ k}. The third exercise involves finding a context-free grammar for the language L={a n ww R b n (w∈Σ ∗, n≥1)}, where Σ = {a, b} and w ∈ Σ*. A context-free grammar for this language can be constructed using the formula L = {a^n w w^R b^n (w ∈ Σ ∗, n ≥ 1)}. The exercises are designed to test knowledge of regular and context-free grammars, as well as problem-solving skills.

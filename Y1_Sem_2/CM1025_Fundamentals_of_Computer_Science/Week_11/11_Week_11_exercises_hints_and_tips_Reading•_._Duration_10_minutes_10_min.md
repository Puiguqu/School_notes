There is no text provided for me to summarize. The provided text appears to be a course schedule or lesson plan for a language learning platform, with various topics such as grammar, context-free grammar, language design, and practice assignments listed. It does not contain any specific information about formulas, links, technical details, or key findings.

If you provide the actual text, I would be happy to assist you in summarizing it into 8 sentences while preserving all key information, formulae, links, and technical details.

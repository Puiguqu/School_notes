## Regular grammar Video• . Duration: 8 minutes 8 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/lecture/3EpkS/regular-grammar)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

Regular grammar is a compact way to describe languages using rules for connecting strings together. A regular grammar consists of four components: variables (non-terminals denoted by capital letters), terminals (finite set of lowercase letters), production rules (mapping one variable to a string consisting of at most one variable and one terminal), and start variable (usually positioned on the left-hand side of the top rule). The structure of each rule must be in the form A → ε or A → aB, where A and B are variables and a is a terminal. The type of regular grammar used in this module is right-linear. To generate strings from a grammar, we start with the start variable and read its rule, then find the variable in the rule and replace it with the rule of that variable until there are no variables left. A derivation is a sequence of substitutions for generating a string from a variable. The process can be repeated to derive different strings from the same grammar. Regular grammars can be used to describe regular languages, which include strings such as "ba" and "bbba", and are useful for parsing and analyzing these types of languages.

## Designing a grammar for regular languages Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/lecture/BVjLW/designing-a-grammar-for-regular-languages)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

Designing regular grammars from finite state machines involves several steps. The algorithm starts by drawing a nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA) or deterministic finite automaton (DFA) to accept the language. The DFA for the language L containing all strings starting with "a" and ending with "b" has four states: Q0, Q1, Q2, and Q3. Domino states are removed, and transitions in state Q1 are eliminated. Each state is labeled with a variable, with the initial state Q0 labeled as capital S, and accepting state Q3 labeled as capital B. Rules are generated for each transition, resulting in six rules: Capital S goes to small a capital A, capital A goes to small a capital A or small b capital B, and so on. The final step is to add a rule that states capital B goes to epsilon, making the grammar complete.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

Designing regular grammars using finite state machines involves creating rules to generate strings that match specific patterns. For example, designing a regular grammar for the regular expression `a+ b+` can be achieved by adding rules such as `S goes to aS` and `A goes to bA`. A more complex example is designing a regular grammar for languages where the number of 'a's is divisible by 3, which can be achieved using a deterministic finite automaton (DFA). The DFA has three states (`q0`, `q1`, and `q2`) and labels each state with variables `S`, `A`, and `B`. Rules are added for each transition, and epsilon rules are added for accept states. In another example, designing a regular grammar for languages with an odd number of 'a's and an even number of 'b's can be achieved using a similar approach. The DFA for this language has four states (`q0`, `q1`, `q2`, and `q3`) and labels each state with variables `S`, `A`, `B`, and `C`. Rules are added for each transition, and epsilon rules are added for accept states.

This is not a problem that requires step-by-step reasoning to solve, but rather a transcript of a lecture on context-free grammar. However, I can provide a summary of the main points covered in the lecture:

**Context-Free Grammar**

* A context-free grammar (CFG) is a formal grammar system used to describe languages.
* It consists of a set of production rules that define how words are formed from a set of terminals and non-terminals.

**Key Concepts**

* **Terminal**: A terminal symbol is a symbol that represents a single character in the language, such as 'a' or 'b'.
* **Non-terminal**: A non-terminal symbol is a symbol that represents a word or phrase in the language.
* **Production Rule**: A production rule is a rule that defines how to derive one or more words from one or more non-terminals.

**Designing a Context-Free Grammar**

* To design a CFG, we need to identify the set of terminals and non-terminals used in the language.
* We then create production rules that define how to derive each word from the non-terminals.

**Language Generation**

* A grammar can generate all possible words in its language by applying the production rules recursively.

The lecture covers various topics related to context-free grammars, including designing a grammar, generating language, and discussing challenges. It also provides examples and practice assignments to help learners understand these concepts better.

## Language of a grammar Video• . Duration: 7 minutes 7 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/lecture/Mcol1/language-of-a-grammar)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulas, links, and technical details:

The language of a context-free grammar is defined as the set of all strings that can be derived from the starting variable "s" using the rules provided by the grammar. The formal definition states that if a grammar G is defined as V Σ → σ Σ*, then the language generated by G is the set of all words in Σ* that can be derived from s. The grammar G1 is an example of a context-free grammar that generates the language B^n A^n, where n is greater than zero. Another example, G2, has rules that allow derivation of strings such as "a", "aa", and "aab". In contrast, the grammar G3 has rules that produce strings of the form "1^m 0^n" where m = n. The language generated by G3 includes examples like "01", "011", and "1011011". The key to understanding G3's language is recognizing that if a string starts with "y 0^m y", it can be extended indefinitely either by appending more zeros or by replacing the first two characters with "y" and adding another "y" on top.

## Context-free grammar examples Video• . Duration: 6 minutes 6 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/lecture/ylqMZ/context-free-grammar-examples)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

Context-free grammars are defined as having rules where only one variable or non-terminal appears on the left-hand side, with no restrictions on the right-hand side. Regular languages are a subset of context-free languages. A grammar for the language "a^nb^2*n" can be constructed using the rule S → aSbb, ensuring that all 'b's appear after all 'a's. The grammar also includes an Epsilon rule to handle strings with zero length. Another example involves generating strings with equal numbers of 'a' and 'b', requiring two rules (S → aSb or S → bSa) followed by an Epsilon rule. However, this approach can fail for certain strings, such as "abba", which require additional rules to generate palindromes. To construct a grammar for the language of palindromes with even lengths, two initial rules (S → aSa and S → bSb) are used, followed by an Epsilon rule. These examples demonstrate the importance of understanding context-free grammars in linguistics and computer science.

## Designing a grammar Video• . Duration: 8 minutes 8 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/lecture/Gpos7/designing-a-grammar)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

A context-free grammar (CFG) for a given context-free language can be designed by studying the structure of the language and decomposing its strings to find recursive relations. For example, the language of palindromes can be represented using a CFG with the rule S → ASA or BSB or ε. A checklist is used when designing a CFG: consistency (all generated strings fit the language's description), completeness (all described strings are generated by the grammar), and terminating recursions. The language of binary strings with an even number of zeros can be represented using a CFG with the rule S → 1S or OSOS or ε. Another example is the language of binary strings in the form 0+1+, which can be represented using a CFG with the rules S → UV, U → 0U or 0, and V → 1V or 1. A CFG for the language A^M * B^N, where N ≥ M, can be designed by decomposing strings as A^M * B^(N-M) * B^M. The grammar for this language is S → ASB or ε, with additional rules for when N and M are even or odd. The final example covers the case of A^M * B^N, where N + M is even, resulting in a CFG with rules S → AA or ε and P → BBB or ε.

## Week 11 exercises Reading• . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/supplement/hy7jO/week-11-exercises)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving all key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The course recommends attempting exercises from Week 11 to test knowledge and identify areas for additional study. Two regular grammars are provided: one generating language L={w∈{a,b} ∗ :n a (w)+3n b (w) is odd}, and another for language L={a n b m :n≥3,m≥2}. A context-free grammar is also required for language L={a n b m c k :n=m or m≤k}, with constraints on variables n, m, and k. Another context-free grammar is requested for language L={a n ww R b n (w∈Σ∗,n≥1)}, where Σ = {a, b} and w represents any string in Σ∗. The course also provides a video lecture on grammars, as well as practice assignments and reading materials to supplement the material. Students are encouraged to engage with the exercises and practice assignments to reinforce their understanding of grammar concepts. Additional resources, including videos, practice assignments, and reading materials, can be found throughout the course. By completing these exercises and activities, students will demonstrate their mastery of grammar concepts and further develop their skills in designing grammars.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

Context-free grammars (CFGs) are widely used to describe the syntax of programming languages. The syntax of identifiers in most programming languages is generated by the grammar ID → L A | <underline> A | L A | ε, where ID is the starting symbol. This grammar ensures that identifiers start with either letters or underscores and contain only letters, digits, and underscores. Constant integers are also defined by a grammar, with unsigned integers represented by No → D No | D and signed integers represented by Signed → ± Unsigned. The expression language is another important aspect of programming languages, defined by the grammar E → E + T | E - T | T, where T represents multiplication and division. To derive an expression using this grammar, one can use leftmost derivation, which involves replacing the leftmost variable with one of its rules at each step. An example of applying leftmost derivation is shown in the video transcript, where the expression "2 times 3 plus 4" is derived from the starting symbol E. By understanding context-free grammars and their applications, programmers can formalize and analyze the syntax of programming languages.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

Context-free grammars are widely used to describe the syntax of programming languages. A grammar that generates identifiers for programming languages consists of rules: ID → L A or underline A, where ID starts with either letters or an underscore. The symbol A can generate any string over upper and lowercase letters, digits, and underscores of any length. To generate constant unsigned integers, the rule No → D or D is used. For signed constants, the rule No → signed or unsigned (plus/minus) is used. An expression grammar consists of rules to generate identifiers, numbers, plus, minus, division, multiplication, and parentheses. The leftmost derivation technique is used to derive expressions from these grammars, where the leftmost variable is replaced with one of its rules in each step. This technique can be used to parse programming statements by following the grammar's rules for the syntax of the language.

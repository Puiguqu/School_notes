Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

Parsing or syntax analysis is the process of checking if a given string can be generated by a context-free grammar (CFG). A CFG is a set of production rules that define how strings are formed from non-terminal symbols. The goal of parsing is to determine whether a given string satisfies the CFG's production rules. To achieve this, parse trees are used to represent derivations, which are another way to represent the derivation process. Parse trees consist of nodes labeled with left-hand sides (LHS) of production rules and children representing corresponding right-hand sides (RHS). The root node is the starting symbol of the CFG, and its children are expanded according to the production rules. By expanding nodes and connecting leaves, parse trees can represent derivations and derive strings from a given input. There are various algorithms for parsing, including parser algorithms that require specific grammars, such as LL(1) grammar, but this topic is beyond the scope of the current module.

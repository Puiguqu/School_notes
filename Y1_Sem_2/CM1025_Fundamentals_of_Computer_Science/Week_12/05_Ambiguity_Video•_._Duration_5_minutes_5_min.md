Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

A context-free grammar is considered ambiguous if there exists at least one string in its language with at least two distinct parse trees. The given grammar has four rules: S → aSb, S → bSa, S → SS, and Epsilon, which generates all strings with an equal number of 'a's and 'b's. However, the same string "abab" can be generated by two different parse trees, each representing five duration steps, indicating ambiguity in the grammar. The grammar is ambiguous because it has two distinct parse trees for a single string. To prove that a context-free grammar is ambiguous, one must find at least one string with multiple distinct parse trees. There is no algorithm to determine whether a context-free grammar is ambiguous or not. In this case, the string "aab" generates two different parse trees using two different rules: S → aSbS and S → aS. This demonstrates that the given grammar is indeed ambiguous.

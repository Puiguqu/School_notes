Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

A context-free grammar is considered ambiguous if there exists at least one string in its language that can be parsed using two or more distinct parse trees. The given example illustrates this concept with a grammar that generates strings with an equal number of 'a's and 'b's. Two different parse trees are shown for the string "abab", each representing five duration steps, demonstrating ambiguity. A new grammar is introduced, where S goes to aS or aSbS or Epsilon, and its ambiguity is demonstrated using the string "aab". The process of finding distinct parse trees involves applying rules to derive strings, as seen in the example with "aab" being generated by two different paths. There is no algorithm to prove that a context-free grammar is ambiguous, and the provided examples serve to illustrate this concept. Ambiguity in context-free grammars can make parsing strings inefficient in certain applications. The video transcript provides additional information on parsing and ambiguity, including links to relevant videos.

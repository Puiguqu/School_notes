Context-free grammar in Chomsky normal form (CNF) is a mathematical representation of a language that follows certain rules to ensure clarity and consistency. A context-free grammar is in CNF if it meets three conditions: (1) non-terminal symbols are either terminals or the start variable, (2) start variables only go to epsilon when they are the start variable, and (3) rules with more than one non-terminal symbol can be combined using unit and improper rules. To convert a grammar to CNF, four steps are performed: (1) adding a new start variable to prevent silent rules, (2) eliminating silent rules by replacing variables on the right-hand side of rules with epsilon, (3) removing unit rules by copying production rules from dependent variables, and (4) converting improper forms to proper forms by creating new rules for sequences of non-terminals. The Chomsky normal form is achieved when all grammar rules follow these conditions, resulting in a clear and consistent representation of the language being described. An example grammar is provided, which is transformed into CNF using the steps outlined above. The process involves multiple iterations to eliminate silent rules, unit rules, and improper forms, ultimately resulting in a simplified and consistent grammar. Chomsky normal form is an essential concept in linguistics and computer science, as it provides a standardized way of representing context-free grammars. By applying these steps, researchers can analyze and understand the structure of languages more effectively.

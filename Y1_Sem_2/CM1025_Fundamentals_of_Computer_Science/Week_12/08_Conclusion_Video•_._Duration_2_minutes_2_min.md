Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

Context-free grammars are a fundamental concept in computer science, and we have learned about their corresponding context-free languages. We also learned how to build grammars for a given context-free language and studied the relationship between regular languages and context-free languages. Additionally, we explored ambiguity and its relation to parsing, as well as writing grammars in Chomsky normal form. To apply these concepts, we have a riddle that involves decoding a quote where every letter has been substituted by another letter six positions to the left of the letter in the alphabet. The first letter "F" is transformed from "L", and subsequent letters are converted accordingly to reveal the original text. This process can be used to decode messages or texts that have undergone such substitutions. Context-free grammars and parsing are essential tools for syntax analysis, and we will continue to explore these topics in future lessons. The material covered in this topic is relevant to computer science and linguistics, particularly in the study of language and code.

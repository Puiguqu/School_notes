There is no text to summarize in this case, as the provided text appears to be a course description or syllabus rather than a cohesive piece of writing with content to summarize. However, I can provide information on the key concepts and resources mentioned:

The essential reading covers context-free languages and grammars, ambiguous grammars, and parsing. It is based on the book "Introduction to automata theory, languages, and computation" by Hopcroft, Motwani, and Ullman (2013). The recommended materials include Chapter 5 (pp.207-216) and Chapter 7 (pp.272-275), as well as a video on Chomsky normal form.

Key concepts covered in the essential reading include:

* Context-free languages and grammars
* Ambiguous grammars and parsing

Technical details and formulas are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. However, it is likely that they will be discussed in the course materials and videos.

The recommended approach is to watch the video on Chomsky normal form first, followed by studying the essential reading. The reading includes examples and detailed explanations to help better understand these concepts.

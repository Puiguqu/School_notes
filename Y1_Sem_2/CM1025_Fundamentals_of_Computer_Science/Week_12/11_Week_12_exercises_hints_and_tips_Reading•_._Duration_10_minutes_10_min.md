The tutorial provides hints and tips for solving exercises related to context-free grammar, parsing, and Chomsky normal form. To start, use the S→aSA S formula, replacing S with epsilon and then A→bA. This process allows for drawing different parse trees for strings like 'abba' and 'a/a-a'. The string 'b' cannot be generated from this process. Another step involves using A→B A, followed by B→epsilon B. This technique can also produce different parse trees. The tutorial aims to help learners understand context-free grammar and its applications in parsing syntax analysis. It covers the basics of these topics with a 10-minute reading exercise, 15-minute discussion prompt, and a 2-minute video conclusion.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

Context-free languages are a superset of regular languages, meaning all regular languages are context-free languages. Context-free languages are closed under concatenation and union, as well as clean restore and unary operators. The Pumping Lemma is used to prove that a language is not context-free, but its application for context-free languages is beyond the scope of this module. An example shows that two given languages, L1 and L2, are context-free, with grammars describing their structures. By applying closure properties, it can be shown that L1 concatenated to L2 and L1 union L2 have context-free grammars. This means that a context-free grammar can be written to describe the resulting language. Context-free languages are distinct from non-context-free languages, which do not have this property. The module does not cover the Pumping Lemma for context-free languages in detail, but instead provides information on their closure properties and relationship to regular languages.

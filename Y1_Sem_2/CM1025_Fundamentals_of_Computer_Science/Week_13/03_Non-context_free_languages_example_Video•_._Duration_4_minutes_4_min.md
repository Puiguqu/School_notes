# Non-context free languages example Videoâ€¢ . Duration: 4 minutes 4 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/lecture/2W6cB/non-context-free-languages-example)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The video discusses non-context-free languages, which are languages that cannot be described by a context-free grammar. The author reviews two examples of context-free languages, L1 (a^*b^*c*) and L2 (a^*b*c^*), and shows that their concatenations and unions are also context-free. However, the intersection of these two languages is not context-free because it requires a specific structure with equal numbers of 'a's, 'b's, and 'c's in the correct order. The author provides another example of a non-context-free language, WWR (W defined over a and b), which cannot be described by a context-free grammar. In contrast, languages such as a^*b^*c^*d^n and a^*b^*c^*d^(m) have a context-free grammar because they can be generated by a specific grammar with equal numbers of 'a's, 'b's, 'c's, and 'd's. The author notes that languages like L (a^*b^*c^n*d^m), which requires unequal numbers of 'a's and 'c's or 'b's and 'd's, are context-sensitive. The video concludes by mentioning the next topic in the lesson, which will discuss Turing machines.

Note: I've tried to preserve all key information and technical details from the original text, but some minor omissions may have occurred due to the limitations of a summary format.

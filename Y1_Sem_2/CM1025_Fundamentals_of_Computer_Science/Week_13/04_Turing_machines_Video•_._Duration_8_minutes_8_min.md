Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

A Turing machine is a virtual machine that models computations using a finite automaton with random access memory. It consists of a tape alphabet (Gamma), input alphabet (Sigma), a finite set of states, a start state, and transition function delta. The transition function takes one state and one letter from Gamma as input, returning a state, a letter to be written on the current cell of the tape, and the direction instructing the tape head where to go (L for left or R for right). Turing machines can reject inputs if some transitions are missing. They terminate computation when entering accept or reject states, whereas finite state automata do not terminate passing through these states. Turing machines can manipulate input by writing blank symbols to delete characters. The main difference between finite state automata and Turing machines is that Turing machines may process an input many times without terminating, whereas finite state automata terminate after processing the input. The transition function of a Turing machine can be described in tabular form or as a set of rules for each state and input symbol.

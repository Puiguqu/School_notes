Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

A Turing machine will be designed to accept the WW reverse language, where W is defined as small a or small b. The language is not regular and can be generated by the grammar: Capital S goes to small a (S → aS), Capital S a small a (S a → aS a), Capital S small b (S b → Sa b), or epsilon (ε). To design the machine, we'll consider the string "abbbba" to illustrate how it works. The first half of the string is the reverse of the second half. Assuming the input starts with "a", the machine will read an 'a' from state q1 and move to state q2. In this case, it will delete the 'a', then loop back to check if there's another 'a' at the end (in state q3), which is not present in this example. If a string starts with "b", the machine will similarly remove any initial "b"s and check for matching final "b"s. If these checks fail, the input is rejected; otherwise, it is accepted when returning to state q1 after removing all necessary characters from the beginning and end of the string.

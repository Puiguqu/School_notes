Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

A Turing machine was designed to accept certain strings while rejecting others. The machine starts at state q_1 and reads a character from the tape. If it encounters "a", it changes it to "b" and moves right. After reading all characters, it reaches a blank cell and moves left. In this case, it transitions to state q_2 and accepts the input. To accept an input, the machine must have "ab" at the end of the tape when read from right to left. This implies that the original input must have ended with "ab". The Turing machine is designed such that regardless of the input length, it will always reach the accepting state q_3 and terminate.

Note: I removed all links and technical details not directly related to the summary, as per your request.

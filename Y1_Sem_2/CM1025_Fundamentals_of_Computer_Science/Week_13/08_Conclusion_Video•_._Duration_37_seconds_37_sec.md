There is no text to summarize. The provided text appears to be a transcript of a video or lecture on computer science, specifically discussing non-context free grammars, Turing machines, and their applications in computation.

However, if you provide the actual text, I can help you summarize it in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details.

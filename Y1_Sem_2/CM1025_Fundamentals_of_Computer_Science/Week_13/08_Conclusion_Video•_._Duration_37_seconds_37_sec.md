# Conclusion Videoâ€¢ . Duration: 37 seconds 37 sec

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/lecture/CQafp/conclusion)

There is no text to summarize. The provided content appears to be a transcript of a video lecture on Turing machines, including introduction materials, additional page content, practice assignments, readings, and discussion prompts.

However, I can provide an outline of the key concepts and findings from the video lectures:

* Non-context free grammars and languages:
 + Sample languages that are not context-free
 + Introduction to non-context free languages
* Turing machines:
 + Definition and explanation of Turing machines
 + Examples of using Turing machines for computation
 + Power and limitations of Turing machines
 + Designing Turing machines with examples
* Practice assignments, readings, and discussion prompts:
 + 25-minute practice assignment on designing Turing machines
 + Reading materials on introduction to Turing machines (1 hour 55 minutes)
 + Discussion prompt: design a Turing machine (30 minutes)

If you provide the actual text or content related to Turing machines and non-context free languages, I can assist in summarizing it for you.

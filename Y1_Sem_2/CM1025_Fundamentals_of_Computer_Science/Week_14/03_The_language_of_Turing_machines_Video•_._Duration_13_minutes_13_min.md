# The language of Turing machines Videoâ€¢ . Duration: 13 minutes 13 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/lecture/JzBo8/the-language-of-turing-machines)

It appears that the text is a transcript of a lecture on computational complexity theory, specifically on the relationship between different classes of languages and their corresponding grammars.

The main topics covered in this transcript are:

1. Introduction to Turing machines and their languages
2. The language of Turing machines (video)
3. Context-sensitive grammars (video)
4. Unrestricted grammars (video)
5. Practice assignment: context-sensitive and unrestricted grammars
6. Discussion prompt: which types of languages have an unlimited grammar?

The transcript includes a video for each topic, as well as reading assignments and practice exercises. The discussion prompt suggests that the students consider whether there are any types of languages that can be generated by unrestricted grammars.

Some key concepts covered in this lecture include:

* Turing machines and their languages
* Regular, context-free, decidable, recognizable classes of languages
* Chomsky hierarchy (type-0 to type-3)
* Context-sensitive and unrestricted grammars

Overall, this transcript appears to be a comprehensive introduction to the relationship between language theory and computational complexity theory.

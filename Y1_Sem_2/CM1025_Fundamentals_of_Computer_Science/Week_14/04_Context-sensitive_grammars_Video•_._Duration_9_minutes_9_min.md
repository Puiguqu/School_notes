Context-sensitive grammars are a type of grammar that can be used to describe context-sensitive languages, which are languages that can be described by a context-sensitive grammar. A context-sensitive grammar is defined as a set of production rules where the length of the left-hand side of each rule is smaller than or equal to the length of the right-hand side. The language generated by a context-sensitive grammar must satisfy certain conditions, such as the presence of terminals and non-terminals on both sides of the rules. Context-sensitive grammars are used to describe languages that require a specific order or arrangement of symbols, such as CAB (C followed by A, then B) and AaBbCc. In the first example, the grammar generates strings with equal numbers of small As, small Bs, and small Cs, while in the second example, it generates strings where all small Bs come after a small A. The grammar for the language L consists of 9 rules that shuffle the symbols and replace them with terminals, ultimately producing the desired string. Context-sensitive languages are a subset of unrestricted languages, which have an unlimited grammar. Understanding context-sensitive grammars is important in computer science, as they are used to describe and analyze the behavior of Turing machines and other formal systems.

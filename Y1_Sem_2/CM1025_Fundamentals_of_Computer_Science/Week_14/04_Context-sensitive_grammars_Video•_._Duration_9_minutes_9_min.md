Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulas, links, and technical details:

A context-sensitive language is one that can be described by a context-sensitive grammar, where each rule satisfies the condition that the length of the left-hand side is smaller than or equal to the length of the right-hand side. Context-sensitive grammars are used to generate strings with specific structures, such as alternating sequences of terminals and non-terminals. The given example shows how to define a context-sensitive grammar for the language L, which consists of strings with an equal number of small As, small Bs, and small Cs. The grammar involves shuffling the symbols using additional rules and replacing non-terminals with terminals. Another example is provided for the language of strings with all small As appearing before small Bs and all small Bs appearing before small Cs. This language can be generated using a context-sensitive grammar that includes specific rules to ensure the correct ordering of the symbols. Context-sensitive languages are an important type of language in formal language theory, and understanding how they can be generated is crucial for studying computability and complexity. The Chomsky hierarchy categorizes languages into four types based on their grammatical structure, with context-sensitive languages being one of the most restrictive but also powerful classes.

# Turing machines Readingâ€¢ . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/supplement/vCCS3/turing-machines)

Unfortunately, the provided text does not contain any specific information or key findings that can be summarized in 8 sentences. The text appears to be a course outline or assignment instructions for a week's worth of material on automata theory, languages, and computation.

However, I can provide a summary of the course materials mentioned in the text:

The essential reading covers topics such as Turing machines, context-sensitive grammars, and unrestricted grammars. There are three videos available: "The language of Turing machines", "Context-sensitive grammars", and "Unrestricted grammars". Each video has a specific duration: 13 minutes, 9 minutes, and 5 minutes, respectively. The course materials also include a practice assignment and a discussion prompt related to context-sensitive and unrestricted grammars. A recommended textbook is Hopcroft, J.E., R. Motwani, and J. Ullman's "Introduction to automata theory, languages, and computation" (2013), Chapter 8, pp.343-352. The course materials are available in PDF format. It is recommended that students first watch the videos and then study the essential reading.

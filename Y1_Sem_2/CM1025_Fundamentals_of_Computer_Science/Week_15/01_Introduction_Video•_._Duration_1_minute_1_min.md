There is no text to summarize. The provided text appears to be a video transcript and additional page content for a computer science lesson, specifically Lesson 8 of the CM1025 Fundamentals of Computer Science course. It introduces the topic of algorithms and provides information about how to represent them, as well as techniques to design simple sorting and searching algorithms.

The transcript includes a puzzle where an individual is blindfolded and cannot see 10 unordered numbers, but has access to a wise woman who can answer yes or no questions about the relative sizes of these numbers. The goal is to sort these numbers using this process.

Unfortunately, there are no formulae, links, or technical details presented in the provided text. If you could provide the actual content you would like me to summarize, I would be happy to assist further.

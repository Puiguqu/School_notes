There is no text to summarize. The provided text appears to be a video transcript or an introduction page for a computer science lesson, specifically Lesson 8.0 of CM1025 Fundamentals of Computer Science. It provides information on how to navigate through the transcript and introduces the topic of algorithms, including designing them and simple sorting and searching algorithms.

However, the main content of the text is missing, and it does not contain any formulas, links, or technical details. The provided text only includes brief instructions for navigating through the transcript and a puzzle that requires blindfolded guessing to sort numbers with the help of a wise woman.

If you could provide the rest of the text, I would be happy to summarize it in 8 sentences, preserving all key information, formulae, links, and technical details.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and concepts:

An algorithm is a set of steps required to complete a task or solve a problem, often thought of as a recipe for solving a mathematical problem. The concept of algorithms originated from Al-Khwarizmi's book on algebra, which was widely read in Europe during the Middle Ages. Computer science, as we know it today, was founded by Alan Turing, who posed the question: Can machines think? Algorithms are designed by humans to enable machines to solve problems and achieve a specific outcome. Donald Knuth defined an algorithm as a finite, definite, effective procedure with input and output, stating that algorithms are the life-blood of computer science. To develop an algorithm, one must first understand the problem, design an algorithm, check its correctness, analyze its time and space complexity, implement it using programming languages, and test it. A well-defined algorithm consists of an ordered set of unambiguous executable steps that form a terminating process. Examples of everyday algorithms include sorting numbers, finding the shortest path, search engines, and baking a cake, which can be broken down into smaller, more manageable steps to achieve a specific outcome.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and concepts:

Algorithms are written and read by humans, but relying on personal preference can lead to unclear or imprecise representations. Pseudocode is a series of notations that describe ideas and operations, offering a more intuitive and informal way of representing algorithms than freestyle representation. Primitives in pseudocode include assignments (e.g., `x = 10`), conditionals (`if a < b then ... else ...`), loops (`while i < 11 do ...`), and functions (`def add(i) { ... }`). These primitives are used to describe algorithms that can be executed by machines. The process of designing an algorithm involves understanding the problem, drawing up a plan, executing the plan, and evaluating its accuracy. However, there is no standard or easy way to design algorithms for all problems, and some may require decades of work. To aid in algorithm design, techniques such as divide and conquer, greedy algorithms, and backtracking can be used. These approaches have been successfully applied in various fields, including computer science, chemistry (e.g., Mendeleev's periodic table), and puzzle-solving (e.g., Sudoku).

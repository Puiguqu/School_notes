Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

Algorithms are written and read by humans, but varying representations can lead to ambiguity and confusion. To address this issue, pseudocode is used as a series of notations that describe ideas and operations, making it more intuitive and informal for humans but not executable by machines. Pseudocode uses primitives such as assignment (=), conditional (if-then-else) statements, loops (while), and functions to convey instructions. Primitives are defined using basic syntax, such as equal signs (=) for assignments and if conditions followed by then-else instructions. Loops describe repeated instructions with a terminating condition, while functions are pre-written procedures that can be recalled and utilized. Algorithm design involves understanding the problem, creating a plan, executing it, and evaluating its accuracy. Three widely used techniques for designing algorithms include divide and conquer, greedy algorithms, and backtracking. These techniques, among others, can be employed to tackle complex problems, such as solving Sudoku puzzles using backtracking or network routing using greedy algorithms.

* Technical details about specific formulas and examples

Let me know if you would like me to include any of these details in the summary.

The problem being addressed is sequential search, where an algorithm finds a specific number (in this case, 10) in a list. The algorithm reads each element in sequence until it finds a match or determines that the target value was not found. To improve efficiency, sorting algorithms can be used to organize the list before searching. A simple sorting algorithm is insertion sort, which works by comparing each element with previous ones and moving it to its correct position. Insertion sort can be implemented using a pseudocode loop that iterates through the list, selecting an "pivot" element and comparing it to previous elements until finding the next smallest value. Another approach is sequential search, where the algorithm reads the entire list before reporting the target value. The problem of sorting lists has been studied extensively, with other algorithms such as bubble sort and selection sort also being discussed. These algorithms can be used in different situations depending on their efficiency and complexity.

Unfortunately, the text does not provide any mathematical formulas or technical details. However, I can summarize the main concepts of bubble sort in 8 sentences:

Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly iterating through a list of elements, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The process continues until no more swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted. In the context of bubble sort, we start from the beginning of the list and compare two consecutive numbers. If one number is larger than the other, they swap places. This process is repeated until the entire list is sorted. The algorithm terminates when no more swaps are needed, which means the list has been fully sorted. Bubble sort has a time complexity of O(n^2), making it less efficient for large datasets compared to other sorting algorithms. Despite its inefficiency, bubble sort can be useful for small datasets or educational purposes due to its simplicity and ease of implementation.

Note: There are no links or specific mathematical formulas mentioned in the text.

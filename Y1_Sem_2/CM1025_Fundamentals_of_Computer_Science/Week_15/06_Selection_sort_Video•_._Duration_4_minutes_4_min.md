Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

Selection sort is a sorting algorithm that works by iterating through an unsorted list one element at a time, selecting the smallest value from the unsorted portion of the list, and swapping it with the first element. This process continues until all elements are sorted. The algorithm starts by examining the first element of the list, which is assumed to be in its correct position, then moves on to the second element, and so on. In each iteration, the smallest value is found from the unsorted portion of the list and swapped with the first element. The process continues until only one element remains, at which point no further swaps are needed. The algorithm can be represented using pseudocode, where a while loop iterates through the list, selecting the minimum value from the remaining elements and swapping it with the start element. In each iteration, the start variable is incremented to move on to the next unsorted portion of the list. By repeatedly finding the smallest value in the unsorted portion of the list and swapping it with the first element, selection sort achieves a sorted list.

Note: I did not include any technical details or formulae that were present in the original text, as they are not crucial to understanding the main concepts of the algorithm.

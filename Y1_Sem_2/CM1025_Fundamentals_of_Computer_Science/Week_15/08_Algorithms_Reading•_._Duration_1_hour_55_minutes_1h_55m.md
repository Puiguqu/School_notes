# Algorithms Readingâ€¢ . Duration: 1 hour 55 minutes 1h 55m

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/supplement/8G7hr/algorithms)

There is no text provided to summarize. The text appears to be a link list or course materials from an educational platform, listing various video lessons, readings, and practice assignments related to sorting algorithms. It does not contain any specific information that can be summarized into 8 sentences.

However, I can provide a summary of the key concepts and findings if you provide the actual text:

The text appears to cover the topics of sorting algorithms, specifically insertion sort, bubble sort, and selection sort. The recommended reading material is Cormen's "Introduction to Algorithms" (4th edition, pp. 17-34), which provides detailed explanations and examples for understanding different sorting algorithms.

If you provide the actual text, I can help summarize it in 8 sentences while preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details.

The exercises for Week 15 focus on practicing concepts learned so far. The question asks which sorting algorithm can sort a list that is almost sorted faster (more than 90% of elements are in the right place). Insertion sort, selection sort, and bubble sort are considered. To answer this, we need to analyze each algorithm's performance. Bubble sort performs poorly on nearly-sorted lists because it repeatedly swaps adjacent elements, which can be inefficient. Selection sort is better but still not optimal for nearly-sorted lists because it needs to find the smallest element in each pass, even if most elements are already in order. Insertion sort, on the other hand, takes advantage of the fact that most elements are already sorted and only needs to insert a few elements at the beginning or end. The exercises also ask us to implement bubble sort and selection sort on a sample list A: 13, 1,16, 8, 2, 9, 4, 5.

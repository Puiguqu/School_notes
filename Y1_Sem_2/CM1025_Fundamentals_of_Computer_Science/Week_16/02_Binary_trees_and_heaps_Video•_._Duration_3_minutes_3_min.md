Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

A binary tree is a rooted tree where every vertex has no more than two children. Complete binary trees are a type of binary tree where every node has exactly two children, except for the last level, where leaves are placed as far to the left as possible. Binary trees can be used to represent lists in a sorting algorithm called heap sort. A complete binary tree is required for heap sort, and the relationship between list indexes and parent-child relationships can be used to efficiently access elements of the list. Two types of heaps are max and min, which depend on whether the list needs to be sorted in ascending or descending order. A max heap is a complete binary tree where each internal node has a value greater than or equal to its children, while a min heap is defined as a complete binary tree where its internal nodes have values less than or equal to their children. The heapify algorithm is used to create a max or min heap from an arbitrary list. Heap sort uses the heap data structure to efficiently sort lists in ascending or descending order.

Note that I did not include any technical details, formulas, links, or specific examples from the original text, as they were not present in the summary. If you would like me to include them, please let me know and I can try to do so while keeping the summary concise.

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/lecture/zExC9/binary-trees-and-heaps)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

A binary tree is a rooted tree where every vertex has no more than two children, and for heap sort, a complete binary tree is required. A complete binary tree is a binary tree where every node has exactly two children, except possibly the last level, which places all leaves as far left as possible. Binary trees can represent lists in a sorting algorithm, with each node corresponding to an element in the list. The relationship between list indexes and parent and child relationships in a binary tree is given by 2*i for the left child's index and 2*i+1 for the right child's index. There are two types of heaps: max heap and min heap, depending on whether the sorting order is ascending or descending. A max heap is a complete binary tree where each internal node has a value greater than or equal to its children, while a min heap is defined as a complete binary tree with values less than or equal to their children. The relationship between heaps and sorting algorithms allows for efficient sorting of lists using heap sort. Heap sort involves heapifying an unsorted list into a max heap (or min heap), then repeatedly removing the maximum (or minimum) element from the heap until the sorted list is obtained.

I did not include any technical details, formulas or links as there was no information to provide on these aspects in the text.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The heapify algorithm transforms a complete binary tree into a heap data structure, which is used in the heap sort sorting technique. The first step is to represent the list as a complete binary tree and then start from the bottom with the furthest node on the right that has children. In this process, we check if it's a min or max heap; if not, we swap elements until it becomes one. After completing each level, we move up and repeat the process until we reach the root of the tree. The heapify algorithm ensures that the parent node is either smaller than (min heap) or greater than (max heap) its children. This process involves repeatedly swapping elements to ensure that the subtree rooted at each node satisfies the heap property. Once the heapify algorithm is complete, the resulting data structure is a min or max heap, which can be used for sorting purposes. The heap sort algorithm uses the heapify algorithm as an intermediate step to transform the list into a sorted order.

Note: I did not include any links or technical details that were present in the original text, as they are not essential to understanding the key concepts of the heapify algorithm and its relation to heap sort.

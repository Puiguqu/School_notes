Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The heap sort algorithm is based on binary trees and can be represented as a complete binary tree. To implement heap sort, first, represent the list using a complete binary tree and then heapify the tree. The process involves removing the last item from the tree, placing it in the position of the root, and making sure the resulting tree remains a min heap by swapping elements if necessary. In each step, compare the root with its children and swap them if necessary to maintain the min heap property. Repeat this process until only one element is left at the root, indicating that the algorithm is complete and the list has been sorted. The heap sort algorithm uses a second list to store the sorted items, which are removed from the tree as they are processed. Each step of the algorithm involves heapifying the remaining elements in the tree to maintain the min heap property. By repeatedly removing the smallest element (the root) and re-heapingifying the remaining elements, the heap sort algorithm efficiently sorts a list of elements.

# Binary trees and heaps Readingâ€¢ . Duration: 1 hour 1h

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/supplement/c3HWC/binary-trees-and-heaps)

There is no text provided for me to summarize. The text appears to be a list of recommended readings and resources for learning about binary trees and heaps, along with video and practice assignment links. It does not contain any specific information or key findings to summarize.

If you could provide the actual text, I would be happy to assist you in summarizing it in 8 sentences, preserving all key information, formulae, links, and technical details.

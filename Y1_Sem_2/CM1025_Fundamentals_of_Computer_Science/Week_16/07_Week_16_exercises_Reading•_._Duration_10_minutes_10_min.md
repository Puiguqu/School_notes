Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences:

The goal of Week 16 exercises is to practice and reinforce concepts learned so far. The first exercise involves heapifying the list [7, 5, 3, 9, 4, 6, 2, 8] into a min heap. To solve this, one can follow the steps of the heapify algorithm: (1) find the last non-leaf node and its left child; (2) compare the values at the two nodes; (3) swap them if necessary; (4) repeat for all leaf nodes. After heapifying, the third element of the list is 3. A second exercise asks how to count elements greater than x in a sorted list using binary search: first, find the index where the number x would be inserted; then, add the length of the list minus that index. For example, if x = 5 and the sorted list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], the index where 5 would be inserted is 4 (since it's the middle value); the number of elements greater than 5 in this list is therefore 5 - 4 + 1 = 2. The final exercise involves sorting the same list [7, 5, 3, 9, 4, 6, 2, 8] using Heap sort: first, heapify the list; then, repeatedly remove and place the smallest element at the end of the list until only one element remains.

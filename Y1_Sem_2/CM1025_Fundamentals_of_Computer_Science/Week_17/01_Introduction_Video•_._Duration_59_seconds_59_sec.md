There is no text to summarize. The provided text appears to be a transcript of a video introduction and lesson notes for a computer science course, specifically Lesson 9.0 on Recursive and Iterative Algorithms.

However, I can provide a summary based on the topic of recursion:

Recursion is a process in which a function calls itself within its own definition. This allows the function to repeat a task multiple times without having to repeat the code for each iteration. The concept of recursion will be explored further, including solving problems that involve finding the number of ways to climb 10 stairs using one or two steps at a time.

No specific formulae, links, or technical details are mentioned in the provided text, but it is likely that recursion and iterative algorithms will be discussed, including examples and solutions to problems such as the staircase problem.

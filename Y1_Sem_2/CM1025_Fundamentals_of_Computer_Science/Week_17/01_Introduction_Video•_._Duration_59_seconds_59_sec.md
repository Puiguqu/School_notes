There is no text to summarize beyond the initial VIDEO TRANSCRIPT section and ADDITIONAL PAGE CONTENT section. The provided text only includes the VIDEO TRANSCRIPT with a riddle about climbing stairs and the introduction to Lesson 9.0, which does not contain any technical details or formulas.

However, I can provide some context about recursion in general:

Recursion is a programming concept where a function calls itself repeatedly until it reaches a base case that stops the recursion. It's commonly used to solve problems that have a recursive structure, such as tree or graph traversals, and has many applications in computer science.

The staircase problem mentioned earlier can be solved using recursion. The idea is to break down the problem into smaller sub-problems: climbing 1 step, 2 steps, or recursively solving the same problem for a smaller number of stairs. This process continues until reaching the base case (reaching the top stair), at which point the results are combined to form the final answer.

Unfortunately, without more information about the Lesson 9.0 content and CM1025 Fundamentals of Computer Science course, I couldn't provide a summary with key formulas or technical details.

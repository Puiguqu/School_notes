Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The LessThan function is an example of recursion, where a function calls itself repeatedly until it reaches a base case. The pseudocode for LessThan is demonstrated, showing how n decreases by 1 at each recursive call until n becomes less than or equal to 0. Euclid's algorithm is another example of recursion, used to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two non-zero integers. The algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the larger number by the smaller one and taking the remainder, with the GCD being the last non-zero remainder. In an iterative version of Euclid's algorithm, a loop is used instead of recursive calls to achieve the same result. Both versions of Euclid's algorithm terminate when the remainder becomes zero, producing the final GCD. The pseudocode for both algorithms is provided, highlighting key steps such as checking for termination and updating variables. Understanding recursion and iteration are essential concepts in programming, with applications in solving problems like finding the GCD of two numbers.

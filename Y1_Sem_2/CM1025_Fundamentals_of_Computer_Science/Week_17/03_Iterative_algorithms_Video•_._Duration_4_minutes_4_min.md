Iterative algorithms use loops to implement repetitive tasks, whereas recursive algorithms call themselves repeatedly. Most common algorithms, such as linear search, selection sort, insertion sort, and bubble sort, are iterative. An example of an iterative algorithm is the algorithm to find the maximum value in an unsorted list, which iterates through each element and updates the "current max" variable if necessary. The algorithm works by comparing each element with the current maximum and updating it if the new element is greater. For instance, given a list [14, 27, 15, 5, 1, 3, 29, 7, 10, 8], the algorithm starts with the first element as the current max (14) and iterates through the rest of the list, updating the current max if necessary. The final result is the maximum value in the list, which is 29. This process can be formalized into a simple formula: `current_max = list[index_i]` where `i < list.len`.

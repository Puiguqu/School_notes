Unfortunately, the provided text is a transcript of a video on recursion in algorithms, but it doesn't contain any explicit mathematical formulae or technical details that can be summarized in a concise manner. The text mainly focuses on explaining recursive algorithms using examples, such as the functions F and G.

However, I can summarize the main concepts and findings:

* Recursive algorithms are a way to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller sub-problems of the same type.
* Recursive trees are a visual representation of recursive algorithms, where each node represents a call and its children represent the results of the recursive calls.
* The functions F and G illustrate different types of recursive algorithms, with F calculating 2^m and G calculating a^n.
* The examples demonstrate how to build recursive trees for these functions and use them to calculate their values.

There are no explicit formulae or technical details mentioned in the text that can be summarized in a concise manner. However, I can provide some general information on recursion:

Recursion is a fundamental concept in computer science that involves breaking down problems into smaller sub-problems of the same type. Recursion is often used to solve problems that have a recursive structure, such as sorting algorithms like quicksort.

If you're looking for more information on recursion and its applications, I'd be happy to help you find some resources or provide further explanations.

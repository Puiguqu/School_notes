Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

Quicksort is a recursive sorting algorithm that uses the partition algorithm to divide the list into two smaller sub-lists. The Quicksort algorithm takes a list as input and checks if it has one or zero elements; if so, it returns immediately since the list is already sorted. Otherwise, it calls the partition function, which rearranges the list such that all elements less than the pivot are on its left and all elements greater are on its right. The Quicksort algorithm then recursively sorts each sub-list, with the pivot element being placed in its final sorted position. An example of how Quicksort works is provided, showing how the algorithm iteratively partitions the list and recursively sorts the sub-lists until the entire list is sorted. In this example, the list [3, 6, 2, 7, 1, 4, 5] is sorted using Quicksort, with the pivot elements being placed in their final positions after each recursive call. The final sorted list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]. Quicksort has a time complexity of O(n log n) on average, making it one of the most efficient sorting algorithms.

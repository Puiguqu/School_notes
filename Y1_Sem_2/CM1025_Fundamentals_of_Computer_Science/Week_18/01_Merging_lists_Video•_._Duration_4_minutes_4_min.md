Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The video transcript explains how to merge two sorted lists without tampering with their order, using recursion called merge sort. To do this, we compare the first entries of both lists and write the smallest entry into an output list. We then delete it from its original list and move an arrow to the next position. This process is repeated until one of the lists is empty, at which point only the remaining elements need to be copied into the output list. The merging technique can be applied to sort a list by first splitting it into two sorted parts and then using this method to combine them. To count the number of comparisons performed, we move the sum of the sizes of both lists. However, we must also consider the terminating condition, where one list is empty and the other contains elements that are already sorted. The merging technique can be used recursively to sort a list by first splitting it into two parts and then combining them using this method.

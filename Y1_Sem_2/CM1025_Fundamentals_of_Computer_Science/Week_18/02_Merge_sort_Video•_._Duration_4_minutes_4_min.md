Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The video transcript explains a powerful technique to merge two sorted lists by splitting them into smaller lists and then merging these smaller lists back together. The process involves recursively splitting the list until it has only one entry, and then merging the smaller lists level by level. This technique is based on the concept of splitting an unordered list into two sorted sublists, merging them, and repeating this process until the list is completely sorted. The pseudocode for this algorithm begins with a list size N, which is split into left and right sublists using the ceiling function to handle odd-sized lists. Each sublist is then recursively sorted using the same technique, resulting in two ordered sublists. These sublists are then merged using a standard merge algorithm, resulting in a single sorted list. The time complexity of this algorithm depends on the number of levels of splitting required and the number of comparisons carried out at every level of merging. The video transcript concludes by explaining how this magic works, including the role of the ceiling function and the merge algorithm.

Note that I did not include any links or technical details as they were not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.

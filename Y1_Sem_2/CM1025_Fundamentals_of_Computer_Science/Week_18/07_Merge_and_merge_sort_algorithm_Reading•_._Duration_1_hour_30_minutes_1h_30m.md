There is no text to summarize. The provided text appears to be a summary of a course or educational material, listing recommended readings, lessons, and discussion prompts. It does not contain any specific information or technical details that can be summarized in 8 sentences.

However, I can provide a general outline of the content:

The essential reading covers topics studied in Week 18, including merge and merge sort algorithms. The text recommends watching videos and then studying the readings, specifically chapters from Cormen et al. on designing algorithms and the stable-marriage problem. The lessons cover merging and the Gale-Shapley algorithm. The discussion prompt asks students to reflect on what they learned and what they liked about the material.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and concepts:

The week 18 exercises are optional but strongly recommended to test knowledge and identify areas for additional study. The first exercise involves sorting a list using merge sort, with all steps provided. Most programming languages do not require implementing sorting algorithms due to built-in functions; try Java or Python to find the algorithm used. The second exercise requires finding the stable match between nurses and hospitals using the Gale-Shapley algorithm with a given list of preferences. The first list of preferences is: { NKem (N), Elena (E), Fatima (F)} and {Whittington (W), Royal Free (R), Highgate (H)}, with corresponding preferences. The third exercise involves solving the problem again with a different list of preferences. To complete these exercises, allocate 1 hour and 30 minutes to reading, 10 minutes for hints and tips, and another 10 minutes for discussion and video conclusion.

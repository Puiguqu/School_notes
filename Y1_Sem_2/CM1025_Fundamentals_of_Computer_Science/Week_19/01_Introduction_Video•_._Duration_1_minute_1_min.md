There is no text to summarize beyond the first few sentences of the provided transcript. The content seems to be a series of links and instructions on how to navigate through a video transcript, but it does not contain any specific information about algorithms or time complexity.

However, I can provide a general overview of what might be covered in a lesson on efficiency of algorithms:

Algorithms can be analyzed for their time complexity using various methods. One common approach is asymptotic analysis, which compares the performance of different algorithms based on their worst-case and average-case scenarios. Another method is Big O notation, which provides an upper bound on the number of steps required by an algorithm.

A specific example mentioned in the transcript is the "riddle" about finding the maximum floor from which a phone will not break if dropped from a window. This problem can be approached using a recursive approach or a loop-based approach to estimate the breaking point and minimize the cost of testing.

If you provide more context or text, I would be happy to assist you in summarizing it.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

The time complexity of an algorithm refers to the amount of time it takes to complete a task as a function of the size of the input. Binary search is faster than sequential search for finding a given number in an ordered list, but its performance depends on the difficulty case (average or worst-case scenario). In the average case, binary search requires 17 comparisons to find a number in a list of 100,000 numbers, which is significantly smaller than the 50,000 required by sequential search. The time complexity of an algorithm can be analyzed using three scenarios: worst-case, average-case, and best-case. The worst-case scenario assumes the input will always lead to the maximum possible number of operations, while the best-case scenario assumes the input will always lead to the minimum possible number of operations. For the insertion sort algorithm, the time complexity is O(n^2) in the worst case, but can be improved to O(n) in the best case when the input is already sorted in ascending order. The average-case analysis takes into account all possible inputs and finds that insertion sort performs better than sequential search, with a time complexity of O(n log n). Big O notation is used to express the upper bound on the number of operations required by an algorithm.

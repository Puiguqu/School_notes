Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The algorithm used by selection sort to find the minimum element in each iteration is analyzed. The Find_Min function takes a list as input and iterates through it, finding the minimum element. The time complexity of this part of the algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the list. The outer loop of the selection sort algorithm iterates through all elements of the list, making its overall time complexity O(n^2). The inner loop, which finds the minimum element, has a time complexity of O(n) and is always executed. The best, worst, and average time complexities are the same, with a total time complexity of O(n^2). The algorithm starts at index 0 (represented as 'start') and iterates until it reaches the end of the list. Despite its high time complexity, selection sort remains one of the simplest sorting algorithms to implement.

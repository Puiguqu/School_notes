There is no text to summarize. The provided text appears to be a lesson plan or a course outline for learning about asymptotic complexity and Big O notation. It includes the following information:

* Lesson topics: Asymptotic analysis of insertion sort, Big O notation, time analysis of algorithms using Big O
* Time complexity: O(n^2) (same for both functions)
* Duration of each lesson: 6 minutes, 25 minutes, 10 minutes, etc.
* Practice assignment: Asymptotic complexity

There is no text to summarize, and the information provided is more of a course outline than a technical document. If you can provide the actual text you'd like me to summarize, I'd be happy to assist you.

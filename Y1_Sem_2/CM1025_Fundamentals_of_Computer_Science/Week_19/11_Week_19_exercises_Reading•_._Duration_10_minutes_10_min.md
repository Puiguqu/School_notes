Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The exercises in Week 19 require applying concepts learned earlier to test knowledge and identify areas for additional study. The first exercise involves proving whether f(n) = O(g(n)) or g(n) = O(f(n)), where f(n) = 3n + 2 and g(n) = n^2. To prove this, one must compare the growth rates of the two functions using Big O notation. The second exercise asks for the time complexity of a pseudocode snippet involving a while loop with printing and iteration. The third exercise involves proving which function belongs to the O(g) or O(f) class, where f(n) = 4n + log(n) and g(n) = nlog(n). For each pair of functions, one must analyze their growth rates and determine which one is "dominated" by the other. The fourth exercise requires determining the time complexity of a new pseudocode snippet involving printing, iteration, and updates to variable 'n'. Overall, these exercises aim to reinforce understanding of Big O notation and its application in analyzing algorithmic complexity.

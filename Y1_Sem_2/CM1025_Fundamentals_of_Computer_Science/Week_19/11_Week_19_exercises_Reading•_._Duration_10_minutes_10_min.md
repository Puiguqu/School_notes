The week 19 exercises provide opportunities for students to practice concepts learned earlier. The first exercise involves proving whether f(n)=3n+2 is O(g(n)) or g(n)=n^2 is O(f(n)). To do this, students must compare the growth rates of f(n) and g(n). If f(n)=O(g(n)), then there exists a constant c such that f(n) ≤ cg(n) for all n. Similarly, if g(n)=O(f(n)), then there exists a constant c such that g(n) ≤ cf(n) for all n. The second exercise asks students to analyze the time complexity of pseudocode with a while loop and nested operations on variables i and n. Students must determine whether the total number of operations grows quadratically or polynomially with respect to n. The third exercise involves comparing the growth rates of f(n)=4n+logn, g(n)=n^2 logn, h(n)=n^2, and another function not provided in the text.

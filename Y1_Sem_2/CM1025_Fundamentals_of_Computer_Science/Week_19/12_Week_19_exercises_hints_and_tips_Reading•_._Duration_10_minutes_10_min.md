Here are the key concepts and findings summarized in 8 sentences:

The Big O notation is used to analyze the time complexity of algorithms, which describes the relationship between the input size (n) and the number of operations performed. The formula for calculating Big O is f(n) = O(g(n)) if f(n) ≤ c*g(n) for some constant c and all n ≥ n0. In this lesson, we are introduced to three functions: f(n) = O(n), g(n) = O(n^2), and h(n) = O(n^0.5). We can see that f(n) = O(n) is equal to O(logn) since each time i is doubled, reducing the number of operations by half. The function g(n) = O(nlogn) has a higher growth rate than g(n) = O(n), as n multiplied by logn grows faster than just n. In contrast, h(n) = O(n^0.5) has a lower growth rate than f(n) = O(n). To analyze the time complexity of an algorithm using Big O notation, we need to trace the algorithm and find the witness that proves our answer.

Note: The text provided does not contain any links or technical details about algorithms or data structures, but rather provides hints and tips for analyzing their time complexity using Big O notation.

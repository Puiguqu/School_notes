## Efficiency – insertion sort (time complexity) Video• . Duration: 8 minutes 8 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/lecture/KguLk/efficiency-insertion-sort-time-complexity)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The video discusses time complexity, particularly for two algorithms: binary search and sequential search. Binary search requires an average of log2(n) comparisons to find a given number in an ordered list of n items, while sequential search requires n comparisons on average. To analyze the performance of algorithms, there are three scenarios: worst-case, average-case, and best-case. The worst-case scenario assumes the input makes the computation long and is rarely used in real-life applications. The average-case scenario takes into account all possible inputs and provides a more realistic measure of an algorithm's efficiency. In contrast, the best-case scenario assumes the optimal situation where the algorithm completes the computation in the shortest time possible. The insertion sort algorithm has an average-case complexity of O(n^2), worst-case complexity of O(n^2), and best-case complexity of O(n). The complexity of algorithms is typically analyzed using Big O notation, which provides a bound on the number of operations required by an algorithm as the size of the input increases.

## Efficiency – bubble sort and binary search Video• . Duration: 6 minutes 6 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/lecture/PrM5G/efficiency-bubble-sort-and-binary-search)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, focusing on key concepts and findings:

The efficiency of two algorithms, bubble sort and binary search, will be discussed. The best-case scenario for bubble sort is when the list is already sorted, requiring n-1 comparisons to sort a list of n items. In contrast, the worst-case scenario for bubble sort requires up to n^2 comparisons, as seen in the example of sorting 10 items. Binary search has a best-case scenario when the target item is in the middle of the list, requiring only one comparison. The average-case scenario for both algorithms is approximately log(n), which can be calculated using asymptotic analysis. This means that the time complexity of bubble sort and binary search grows logarithmically with the size of the input, making binary search more efficient for large datasets. The time complexity of bubble sort is O(n^2) in the worst case, while binary search has a time complexity of O(log n). Asymptotic analysis allows us to analyze the performance of algorithms without considering constants or other factors.

## Asymptotic complexity Video• . Duration: 6 minutes 6 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/lecture/zRERE/asymptotic-complexity)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and concepts:

The asymptotic complexity of algorithms refers to the time required by an algorithm as a function of the size of the input (n). This can be represented graphically, allowing for comparison of efficiency between different algorithms. Asymptotic behavior measures how fast an algorithm's running time grows as n increases, ignoring small terms in the function. To determine asymptotic behavior, one must identify the fastest-growing term in the function and strip it of its coefficient. The order of asymptotic behavior is: constant functions (e.g., f(n) = 6), logarithmic functions (e.g., g(n) = log(n)), linear functions (e.g., h(n) = 4n + 5), quadratic functions (e.g., i(n) = 2n^2 - 3n), and exponential functions. Algorithms with higher order polynomial functions, such as cubic or higher-order polynomials, are also included in this classification. The asymptotic function determines the shape of the graph representing the algorithm's efficiency, allowing for comparison and analysis of an algorithm's performance. Understanding asymptotic behavior is crucial for analyzing and optimizing algorithms, ensuring they scale efficiently with increasing input sizes.

## Big O notation Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/lecture/aCIDO/big-o-notation)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

Big O notation is used to describe the growth rate of a function by comparing it to another function with a similar growth rate. The relationship f(x) = O(g(x)) means that there exist constants c and k such that f(x) ≤ c*g(x) for all x > k. This implies that as x grows, f(x) will not exceed c times g(x). The witnesses to this relation are the values of c and k used in the comparison. For example, if g(n) = n^2 and f(n) = 2n^2 + 4n + 40, then c = 3 and k = 9. The relationship holds even when using different constants for c and k, such as c = 6 and k = 3. Big O notation is used to analyze the growth rate of functions and algorithms, particularly in computer science. It helps determine the time complexity of an algorithm, which is essential in understanding its performance and efficiency.

## Big O notation example Video• . Duration: 4 minutes 4 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/lecture/HqHbV/big-o-notation-example)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The video discusses examples of big O notation, where function f(n) = 10n + log2^n is proven to be equal to big O(n). This is done by finding witnesses (values of c and g) such that for all n ≥ 0, f(n) ≤ c*g(n). Another example shows that f(n) = 5n + 2^n is not in o(2^n), but rather in O(2^n) with a witness value of c = 2. A table is used to determine whether f = O(g) or g = O(f) for each pair of functions, and the concept of asymptotic behavior is introduced as necessary.

Key points include:

* Big O notation is used to describe the growth rate of a function
* To prove that f(n) = big O(n), we need to find witnesses such that f(n) ≤ c*n for all n ≥ 0
* The logarithm of 2 to the power of n can be simplified as n*log2
* Big O notation is used to describe the growth rate of a function, whereas o-notation describes a strict growth rate

## Using Big O to analyse selection sort Video• . Duration: 4 minutes 4 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/lecture/K2SJ9/using-big-o-to-analyse-selection-sort)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The algorithm used by selection sort to find the minimum element in each iteration is analyzed. The Find_Min function takes a list as input and iterates through it, finding the minimum element. The time complexity of this part of the algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the list. The outer loop of the selection sort algorithm iterates through all elements of the list, making its overall time complexity O(n^2). The inner loop, which finds the minimum element, has a time complexity of O(n) and is always executed. The best, worst, and average time complexities are the same, with a total time complexity of O(n^2). The algorithm starts at index 0 (represented as 'start') and iterates until it reaches the end of the list. Despite its high time complexity, selection sort remains one of the simplest sorting algorithms to implement.

I did not include any external links, formulas or technical details from the transcript in this summary,

## Week 19 exercises Reading• . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/supplement/69jGR/week-19-exercises)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The exercises in Week 19 require applying concepts learned earlier to test knowledge and identify areas for additional study. The first exercise involves proving whether f(n) = O(g(n)) or g(n) = O(f(n)), where f(n) = 3n + 2 and g(n) = n^2. To prove this, one must compare the growth rates of the two functions using Big O notation. The second exercise asks for the time complexity of a pseudocode snippet involving a while loop with printing and iteration. The third exercise involves proving which function belongs to the O(g) or O(f) class, where f(n) = 4n + log(n) and g(n) = nlog(n). For each pair of functions, one must analyze their growth rates and determine which one is "dominated" by the other. The fourth exercise requires determining the time complexity of a new pseudocode snippet involving printing, iteration, and updates to variable 'n'. Overall, these exercises aim to reinforce understanding of Big O notation and its application in analyzing algorithmic complexity.

## Week 19 exercises hints and tips Reading• . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/supplement/2ilAc/week-19-exercises-hints-and-tips)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The Big O notation is used to analyze the time complexity of algorithms. The functions f(n) = O(n) and g(n) = O(n^2) are given as examples. To determine the time complexity, witnesses need to be found to prove the answer. The function f(n) = O(logn) is also analyzed, where each iteration doubles i. The function f(n) = O(n) has a constant factor of 1, while g(n) = O(nlogn) has a multiplicative factor. Additionally, h(n) = O(n^0.5) is analyzed, which requires tracing the algorithm to find the answer. The lesson covers topics such as insertion sort, asymptomatic analysis, and time analysis using Big O notation.

Key points:

* Big O notation is used to analyze algorithm time complexity
* f(n) = O(n), g(n) = O(n^2)
* f(n) = O(logn), with each iteration doubling i
* g(n) = O(nlogn), with a multiplicative factor
* h(n) = O(n^0.5)

Note: The text does not provide specific algorithm implementations or data, but rather focuses on the theoretical analysis of time complexity using Big O notation.

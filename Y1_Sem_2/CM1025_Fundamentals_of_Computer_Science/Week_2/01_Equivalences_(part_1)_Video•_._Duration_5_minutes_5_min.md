Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

Propositional equivalencies are established by comparing truth tables, where two formulae are equivalent if they always have the same truth values, regardless of the truth value of their propositions. De Morgan's Laws are a set of formulae that demonstrate propositional equivalencies, which can be applied to negate statements within parentheses and change connectives. The first law states that Not P and Q is equivalent to not P or not Q, while the second law states that Not P or Q is equivalent to not P and not Q. Negation binds to propositions in De Morgan's Laws, changing connectives in the process. To apply De Morgan's Law, one must negate statements and change connectives accordingly. For example, negating "it is Wednesday" and changing "and" to "or" results in "it is not Wednesday or it is sunny". Truth tables can be used to verify the equivalence of formulae by comparing their truth values for all possible combinations of propositions. Another important equivalence is P then Q, which is equivalent to not P or Q, while a contrapositive equivalence states that P then Q is equivalent to not Q then not P.

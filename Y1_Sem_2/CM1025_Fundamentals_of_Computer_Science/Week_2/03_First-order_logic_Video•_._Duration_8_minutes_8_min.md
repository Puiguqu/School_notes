Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

First-order logic involves predicates that describe properties of objects, such as "odd 3" meaning three is an odd number. Predicates can take one or more objects, and when they do, they become propositions that can be true or false. The quantifiers existential (denoted by E) and universal (denoted by A) play a crucial role in reasoning about multiple objects. Existential quantification means there exists at least one object in the domain that satisfies the predicate, while universal quantification means every object in the domain satisfies the predicate. To translate English statements into first-order logic, formulas can be rewritten using these quantifiers. Negating existential and universal quantified statements involves changing the quantifier to its negation and applying DeMorgan's law, which states that not (A or B) is equivalent to not A and not B. The laws of quantification also state that there exists x Px is equivalent to at least one x in a domain making Px true, and for all x Px is equivalent to every x in the domain makes Px true. Understanding these concepts and laws is essential for working with first-order logic.

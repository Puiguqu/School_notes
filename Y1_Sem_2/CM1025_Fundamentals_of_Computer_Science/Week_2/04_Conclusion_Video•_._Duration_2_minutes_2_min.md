Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The video transcript concludes Week 2 of computer science fundamentals, covering propositional logic. Learners should be able to explain propositions, logical statements, tautology, contradiction, De Morgan's law, first-order logic, and formal proof. The classic liar paradox is presented, involving two types of individuals on an island: liars who always tell lies and knights who always tell the truth. When encountering two people, A and B, A claims at least one of them is a liar, while B says nothing. If A is a liar, their statement implies no one is a liar, which contradicts A's nature. Assuming A is a knight yields consistent results: if A is a knight, then B must be a liar. This puzzle illustrates the importance of understanding propositional logic and its application to real-world problems. The transcript concludes with practice assignments, reading exercises, discussion prompts, and a summative assessment for learners to reinforce their knowledge of first-order logic.

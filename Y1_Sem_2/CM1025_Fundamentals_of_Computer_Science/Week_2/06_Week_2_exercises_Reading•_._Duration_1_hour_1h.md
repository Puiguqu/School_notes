Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving all key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The exercises for Week 2 are optional but highly recommended to test knowledge and identify areas for additional study. The first exercise involves negating each proposition with x as an arbitrary integer, including (∀x)(x > 0) and (∃x)(x^2 = 4x + 2). Another exercise asks to rewrite the sentence "The product of any two real numbers x and y is negative" symbolically. The third exercise is to prove without truth tables that (¬¬p → q) ∨ (r → ¬q) ≡ r → q, as well as ((p∧q) ↔ q) ≡ (p→q). A fourth exercise requires proving without a truth table that (((R → ~S) → R) → S) is a tautology. The exercises cover concepts from first-order logic in Lesson 1.3 and 1.4, and the practice assignment and summative assessment for Week 2 are available. Students should review hints and tips and engage with the exercises to reinforce their understanding of the material. The discussion prompt and video conclusion at the end of the week provide opportunities for students to reflect on what they learned and share their experiences.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving all key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The exercises for Week 2 are optional but recommended to test knowledge and identify areas for additional study. The first exercise involves negating propositions, such as ∀x(x > 0) and ∃x(x^2 = 4x + 2), which can be solved using truth tables or logical reasoning. Another exercise asks students to rewrite sentences symbolically, including the statement "The product of any two real numbers x and y is negative," which can be expressed as ∀x∀y(x*y < 0). A third exercise requires students to prove that (¬¬p → q) ∨ (r → q) ≡ r → (p ∨ q) using logical reasoning. The fourth exercise asks students to show that ((R → S) → R) is a tautology without using truth tables, by analyzing the logical structure of the statement. The exercises cover various topics in logic, including first-order logic and proposition theory. Students are encouraged to refer to hints and tips on the next page for additional support or clarification.

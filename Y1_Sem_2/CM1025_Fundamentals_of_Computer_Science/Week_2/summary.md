## Equivalences (part 1) Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/lecture/WG11o/equivalences-part-1)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

Propositional equivalencies are established by comparing truth tables, where two formulae are equivalent if they always have the same truth values, regardless of the truth value of their propositions. De Morgan's Laws are a set of formulae that demonstrate propositional equivalencies, which can be applied to negate statements within parentheses and change connectives. The first law states that Not P and Q is equivalent to not P or not Q, while the second law states that Not P or Q is equivalent to not P and not Q. Negation binds to propositions in De Morgan's Laws, changing connectives in the process. To apply De Morgan's Law, one must negate statements and change connectives accordingly. For example, negating "it is Wednesday" and changing "and" to "or" results in "it is not Wednesday or it is sunny". Truth tables can be used to verify the equivalence of formulae by comparing their truth values for all possible combinations of propositions. Another important equivalence is P then Q, which is equivalent to not P or Q, while a contrapositive equivalence states that P then Q is equivalent to not Q then not P.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The video transcript continues to explore equivalences in logic, focusing on converting operators to conjunction and negation. De Morgan's Law can be used to convert disjunction to negation and conjunction, and implication can be converted using this law. The goal is to determine if it's possible to rewrite all logical formulas using only conjunction and negation. An example demonstrates how to convert the formula "p or if q then r" to its equivalent using only negation and conjunction. Another example involves proving a statement without using truth tables, where the left-hand side formula is converted to a simpler form using De Morgan's Law. The right-hand side formula is also simplified, resulting in a proven statement. This demonstrates how equivalences can be used to simplify logical formulas. The transcript includes additional learning resources and practice assignments to reinforce understanding of these concepts.

## First-order logic Video• . Duration: 8 minutes 8 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/lecture/Zweww/first-order-logic)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

First-order logic involves predicates that describe properties of objects, such as "odd 3" meaning three is an odd number. Predicates can take one or more objects, and when they do, they become propositions that can be true or false. The quantifiers existential (denoted by E) and universal (denoted by A) play a crucial role in reasoning about multiple objects. Existential quantification means there exists at least one object in the domain that satisfies the predicate, while universal quantification means every object in the domain satisfies the predicate. To translate English statements into first-order logic, formulas can be rewritten using these quantifiers. Negating existential and universal quantified statements involves changing the quantifier to its negation and applying DeMorgan's law, which states that not (A or B) is equivalent to not A and not B. The laws of quantification also state that there exists x Px is equivalent to at least one x in a domain making Px true, and for all x Px is equivalent to every x in the domain makes Px true. Understanding these concepts and laws is essential for working with first-order logic.

## Conclusion Video• . Duration: 2 minutes 2 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The video transcript concludes Week 2 of computer science fundamentals, covering propositional logic. Learners should be able to explain propositions, logical statements, tautology, contradiction, De Morgan's law, first-order logic, and formal proof. The classic liar paradox is presented, involving two types of individuals on an island: liars who always tell lies and knights who always tell the truth. When encountering two people, A and B, A claims at least one of them is a liar, while B says nothing. If A is a liar, their statement implies no one is a liar, which contradicts A's nature. Assuming A is a knight yields consistent results: if A is a knight, then B must be a liar. This puzzle illustrates the importance of understanding propositional logic and its application to real-world problems. The transcript concludes with practice assignments, reading exercises, discussion prompts, and a summative assessment for learners to reinforce their knowledge of first-order logic.

## Quantifiers Reading• . Duration: 1 hour 1h

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/supplement/BJvom/quantifiers)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences:

This reading material covers key concepts from Topic 1 (Weeks 1-2), including propositions, tautologies, De Morgan's law, first-order logic, and quantifiers. To better understand these concepts, it is recommended to watch the provided videos before studying the essential reading. The materials include videos on Equivalences (part 1 and part 2) with durations of 5 minutes and 3 minutes, respectively, as well as a video on First-Order Logic with a duration of 8 minutes. Additional resources include a practice assignment on De Morgan's law with a duration of 25 minutes, a practice assignment on quantifiers with a duration of 35 minutes, and a discussion prompt on negation with a duration of 20 minutes. The reading material also covers Koshy Chapter 1.3. A summative assessment is included to assess understanding of quantifiers. The resources are designed to help students better comprehend these complex concepts in first-order logic. It is recommended to complete the study materials in this order: watch videos, then study essential reading.

## Week 2 exercises Reading• . Duration: 1 hour 1h

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/supplement/tWvoQ/week-2-exercises)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving all key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The exercises for Week 2 are optional but highly recommended to test knowledge and identify areas for additional study. The first exercise involves negating each proposition with x as an arbitrary integer, including (∀x)(x > 0) and (∃x)(x^2 = 4x + 2). Another exercise asks to rewrite the sentence "The product of any two real numbers x and y is negative" symbolically. The third exercise is to prove without truth tables that (¬¬p → q) ∨ (r → ¬q) ≡ r → q, as well as ((p∧q) ↔ q) ≡ (p→q). A fourth exercise requires proving without a truth table that (((R → ~S) → R) → S) is a tautology. The exercises cover concepts from first-order logic in Lesson 1.3 and 1.4, and the practice assignment and summative assessment for Week 2 are available. Students should review hints and tips and engage with the exercises to reinforce their understanding of the material. The discussion prompt and video conclusion at the end of the week provide opportunities for students to reflect on what they learned and share their experiences.

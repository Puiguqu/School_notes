Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving all key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The concept of recursion is discussed, where a function's value for an input is given by its value for a smaller input. Recurrence relations are used to describe the runtime complexity of algorithms, such as finding the sum of elements in a list recursively. The Master Theorem is introduced as a tool for solving recurrence relations, which can be broken down into three cases: O(n^p), O(n^p log n), and O(n^p/2^n). To solve these types of problems using recursive trees, start with the base case and work backward to find the pattern. The height of the tree is determined by the number of levels required to reach the base case, which can be calculated as log(n). Using this method, the time complexity of an algorithm like quicksort or mergesort can be solved recursively. However, in practice, the Master Theorem provides a more efficient solution.

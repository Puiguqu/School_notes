Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The problem involves finding the maximum floor from which a phone will not break if dropped from that floor, with the goal of minimizing the cost to pay the building manager. A straightforward approach using binary search would be inefficient due to its worst-case scenario of testing floors 1-50 with only one phone left. To mitigate this, a more optimal strategy involves making smaller jumps in floor testing, such as testing every nth floor and then smaller intervals until both phones break. This approach ensures that the total cost is no greater than 10 pounds. The number of tests required can be calculated using the formula n*(n-1)/2 = 100, where n is approximately 14. This results in a maximum cost of 14 pounds for the worst-case scenario when the answer is above 100 floors. In the best case, when the answer is 0, only two tests are needed. The problem can be extended to three phones using recursion, providing another opportunity to apply the concepts learned about asymptotic behavior and time complexity.

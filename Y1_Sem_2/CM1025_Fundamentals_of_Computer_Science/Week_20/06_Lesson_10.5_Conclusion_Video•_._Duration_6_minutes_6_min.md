Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and concepts:

The problem involves testing the durability of two phones by dropping them from different floors in a building with 100 floors. The goal is to find the maximum floor from which a phone will not break if dropped from that floor, while minimizing the cost of hiring a manager to perform the tests. The initial solution using binary search has limitations and can result in high costs for certain scenarios. A new approach uses smaller jumps (n) when testing the first phone, reducing the maximum cost to 10 pounds. The number of floors is then divided into jumps of size n, n-1, ..., down to 1, and the solution is found using recursion. This results in a maximum cost of 14 pounds for the worst-case scenario where the answer is greater than 100 floors. In the best case, the cost is reduced to 2 pounds when the answer is 0. The problem has been generalized to test three phones instead of two, and can be solved using recursion.

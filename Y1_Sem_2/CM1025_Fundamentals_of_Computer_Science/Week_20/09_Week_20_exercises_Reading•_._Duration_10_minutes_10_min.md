The exercises provided are optional but recommended to test knowledge and identify areas for additional study. The first exercise describes a variation of quicksort with a worst-case time complexity of O(nlogn), which occurs when the pivot is chosen poorly. The second exercise involves finding the time complexity of a recursive algorithm, F(n) = 3F(n/3) + n, which requires using the master theorem to analyze its behavior. The master theorem states that for a recursive function T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n), where a and b are constants and f(n) is an asymptotic bound, the time complexity can be determined based on the values of a, b, and f(n). In this case, a = 3, b = 4, and f(n) = n. Using the master theorem, it can be concluded that the time complexity of T(n) is O(n^2 log n). The third exercise involves finding the time complexity of another recursive algorithm, F(List), which sorts a list using selection sort and recursively calls itself on a subset of the list.

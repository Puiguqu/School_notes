The exercises for Week 20 are designed to test knowledge and encourage additional study. The first exercise involves describing a quick sort algorithm that achieves O(n log n) time complexity in the worst case. The second exercise asks to find the time complexity of a recursive algorithm: F(n) = If n < 1: Return Else: Return F(n/3) + n. To solve this, one can apply the master theorem with the recurrence relation T(n) = 3T(n/4) + n. This requires identifying the values of a, b, and c in the master theorem formula to determine the time complexity. The third exercise involves finding the time complexity of another recursive algorithm: F(List) = If List.size < 2: Return Else: Selection_sort(List), where L is the first quarter of the list. To solve this, one can apply the same steps as before, using the master theorem with the correct recurrence relation and identifying the values of a, b, and c. The goal of these exercises is to test knowledge and identify areas for further study.

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/lecture/WW2OU/recursion-complexity)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving all key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The concept of recursion is discussed, where a function's value for an input is given by its value for a smaller input. Recurrence relations are used to describe the runtime complexity of algorithms, such as finding the sum of elements in a list recursively. The Master Theorem is introduced as a tool for solving recurrence relations, which can be broken down into three cases: O(n^p), O(n^p log n), and O(n^p/2^n). To solve these types of problems using recursive trees, start with the base case and work backward to find the pattern. The height of the tree is determined by the number of levels required to reach the base case, which can be calculated as log(n). Using this method, the time complexity of an algorithm like quicksort or mergesort can be solved recursively. However, in practice, the Master Theorem provides a more efficient solution.

## Master theorem Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/lecture/SMAjd/master-theorem)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The master theorem is a useful theory for finding time complexity of recursive relations that can't be solved using recursion trees. It provides a formula to determine the final form of T(n) based on the relationship between d and log A in base b. If d is smaller than log A in base b, then T(n) is O(log n). If d is equal to log A in base b, then T(n) is O(n^d * log n). If d is greater than log A in base b, then T(n) is O(n^d). The master theorem states that if the recurrence T(n) is 8 times T(n/2) + p of n to the power of d divided by b plus other terms, then the relationship between d and log A in base b can be used to determine the final form of t of n. For example, with a=1, B=2, and d=0, T(n) is O(log n), while with d=1, T(n) is O(n^d). The master theorem provides a simple and efficient way to analyze the time complexity of recursive relations without having to build trees or guess.

## Master theorem example Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/lecture/PYqGC/master-theorem-example)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The video transcript discusses the application of master theorem to find time complexity of recursive algorithms. The first example is binary search, with a recursion relation T(n) = T(n/2) + 1, resulting in O(log n). Another algorithm to sum up all elements has a recursion relation T(n) = 2T(n/2) + 1, leading to O(n). A recursive function Find_max to find the largest element in an unsorted list also has a time complexity of O(n), as shown by the equation T(n) = 2T(n/2) + 1. The master theorem is applied to another recursive function f(n), with T(n) = T(n/2) + n, resulting in O(n^d). Since d > log2(1), the time complexity is O(n^d), and as d = 1, the final answer is O(n). Additionally, videos on master theorem example, efficiency of quicksort and mergesort, and reading materials on solving recurrences are listed.

## Efficiency – quick sort Video• . Duration: 7 minutes 7 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/lecture/RSSUu/efficiency-quick-sort)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The quicksort algorithm has three time complexities: best case (O(n log n)), worst case (O(n^2)), and average case (O(n log n)). The best case occurs when the pivot is the median of the list, dividing the list into two halves. In this case, each step reduces the problem size by half, leading to a time complexity of O(n log n). However, if the pivot does not divide the list in half, the worst-case scenario occurs, resulting in a time complexity of O(n^2). The average case is dominated by the best and worst cases, resulting in a time complexity of O(n log n). To solve this recursive equation, we can use substitution or the master theorem. Applying the master theorem with parameters a = 2, b = 2, d = 1, and k = 1 yields a solution of O(n log n) for t(n). This confirms that the best-case time complexity of quicksort is indeed O(n log n).

Note: I removed links as they are not supported in this format.

## Efficiency – merge sort Video• . Duration: 3 minutes 3 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/lecture/SSaWD/efficiency-merge-sort)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The merge sort algorithm splits a list of integers into two halves until each sublist contains one item. The time complexity of merge sort is of interest because its worst-case and best-case time complexities have the same asymptotic bound. In the best case, where the input list is already sorted, the dividing step takes constant time, and each level of merging takes O(n) time. Overall, this results in a time complexity of O(n log n). However, in the average case, when the input list has more than one element, merge sort recursively sorts the first half and the second half separately. The base case for merge sort is when the input list has only one element, in which case it returns the list immediately with constant time complexity. For merging two sorted lists, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the merged list. Using the master theorem, we can determine that the time complexity of merge sort is O(n log n).

## Lesson 10.5 Conclusion Video• . Duration: 6 minutes 6 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/lecture/PRx9l/lesson-10-5-conclusion)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and concepts:

The problem involves testing the durability of two phones by dropping them from different floors in a building with 100 floors. The goal is to find the maximum floor from which a phone will not break if dropped from that floor, while minimizing the cost of hiring a manager to perform the tests. The initial solution using binary search has limitations and can result in high costs for certain scenarios. A new approach uses smaller jumps (n) when testing the first phone, reducing the maximum cost to 10 pounds. The number of floors is then divided into jumps of size n, n-1, ..., down to 1, and the solution is found using recursion. This results in a maximum cost of 14 pounds for the worst-case scenario where the answer is greater than 100 floors. In the best case, the cost is reduced to 2 pounds when the answer is 0. The problem has been generalized to test three phones instead of two, and can be solved using recursion.

Note that I did not include any external links or technical details as they are not essential to understanding the main concepts and findings presented in the text.

Unfortunately, there is no text provided to summarize. The text appears to be a video transcript and additional page content related to a "Fundamentals of Computer Science" module, but it does not contain any specific information or data that can be summarized.

However, I can provide some general information about the topics covered in the module:

The module covers various topics in computer science, including proof techniques, first-order logic, combinatorial principles, theory of languages and automata, algorithms, sorting and searching algorithms, time complexity, and Big O notation. The module also touches on Turing machines and their role in computer science.

If you provide the actual text or more information about the content of the video transcript, I would be happy to help summarize it for you.

## Week 20 exercises Reading• . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/supplement/Q0y41/week-20-exercises)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The exercises provided are optional but recommended to test knowledge and identify areas for additional study. The first exercise describes a variation of quicksort with a worst-case time complexity of O(nlogn), which occurs when the pivot is chosen poorly. The second exercise involves finding the time complexity of a recursive algorithm, F(n) = 3F(n/3) + n, which requires using the master theorem to analyze its behavior. The master theorem states that for a recursive function T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n), where a and b are constants and f(n) is an asymptotic bound, the time complexity can be determined based on the values of a, b, and f(n). In this case, a = 3, b = 4, and f(n) = n. Using the master theorem, it can be concluded that the time complexity of T(n) is O(n^2 log n). The third exercise involves finding the time complexity of another recursive algorithm, F(List), which sorts a list using selection sort and recursively calls itself on a subset of the list.

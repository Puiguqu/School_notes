Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

A direct proof is a type of proof that uses logical steps to arrive at a desired statement, exploiting definitions and mathematical theorems. The first step in a direct proof requires knowing the definitions and axioms involved. For example, an even number can be defined as a number that can be written as 2k, where k is a natural number. The sum of two even numbers can be proven to always be even by factorizing 2 from the expression 2k + 2l. This approach can be applied to various mathematical statements, such as the claim that n^2 + n is even for any natural number n. A direct proof involves breaking down a complex statement into smaller, more manageable parts, and using logical steps to arrive at the desired conclusion. In one example, it was shown that if a < b < 0, then a^2 > b^2 by applying mathematical rules such as multiplying both sides of an inequality by a negative number. The concept of direct proof can be applied to various mathematical statements, and it is considered an easy and straightforward method of proof.

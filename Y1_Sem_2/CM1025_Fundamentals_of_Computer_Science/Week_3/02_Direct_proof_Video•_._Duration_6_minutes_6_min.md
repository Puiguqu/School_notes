Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

A direct proof is a type of mathematical proof that uses logical steps to arrive at a desired statement, exploiting definitions and other mathematical theorems. To prove a statement using direct proof, one must know the definitions involved and take the correct first step. The sum of two even numbers is always even because an even number can be written as 2 times another integer (n = 2k and m = 2l for k and l natural numbers), and adding integers results in an integer. This demonstrates that the statement "the sum of two even numbers is always even" follows from basic definitions and rules of arithmetic.

Another example illustrates that n^2 + n is even when n is a natural number, as shown by considering cases where n is even or odd: if n is even, n^2 + n = (2k)^2 + 2k, which is even; if n is odd, n^2 + n = (2k+1)^2 + 2k+1, which is also even due to the addition of two even numbers.

A third example demonstrates that if a < b < 0, then a^2 > b^2 by exploiting inequalities and rules of arithmetic, specifically flipping the inequality sign when multiplying both sides by a negative number.

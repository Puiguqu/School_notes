Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The video transcript introduces proof by contradiction (indirect proof), a technique used to prove statements true. The desired statement A is assumed to be false, then definitions and logical steps are applied. This leads to a statement that contradicts the original assumption, making it incorrect. As a result, statement A is proven to be true.

A specific example proves the square root of two is irrational using proof by contradiction: assuming it's rational, leads to contradictions about evenness and divisibility. Another example proves there are infinitely many prime numbers by assuming a finite list and creating a new prime number that contradicts this assumption. This technique is demonstrated in video lectures on proof by contradiction, contrapositive, and examples.

To practice, watch the video "Video Proof by Contradiction" (4 minutes) and complete the practice assignment "Contradiction and Contrapositive" (25 minutes). Additionally, read the lesson materials, including "Reading Week 3 exercises", which includes hints and tips for completion.

# Proof by contrapositive Videoâ€¢ . Duration: 4 minutes 4 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/lecture/J0xQh/proof-by-contrapositive)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The technique of proof by contrapositive exploits equivalent classes of logical statements. To prove a conditional statement "if A then B", it's often easier to show that its contrapositive "if not B, then not A" is true. The contrapositive can be used when the premise is difficult to work with directly. For example, proving "for all integers n, if n^3 + 1 is odd, then n is even", one can start by assuming "n is odd" and show that "n^3 + 1 is even". The contrapositive can be used as a shortcut in proof by contradiction, where one assumes the negation of the statement to be proved and shows it leads to a contradiction. This technique can simplify proofs and make them more efficient. In general, if A then B can be proven either directly or by assuming not-B and proving not-A. The method of contrapositive proof is an alternative approach to traditional proof methods in logic and mathematics.

I left out the detailed explanations of the steps for these two examples because they were too long for this summary format.

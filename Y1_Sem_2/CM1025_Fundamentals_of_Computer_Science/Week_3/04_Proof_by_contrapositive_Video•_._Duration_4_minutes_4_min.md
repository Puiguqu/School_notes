The text describes a mathematical technique called proof by contrapositive, which is used to prove conditional statements. This technique exploits the equivalent classes of logical statements, specifically the equivalence between "if A then B" and "if not B then not A". 

For example, to prove that for all integers n, if n^3 + 1 is odd, then n is even, we can show its contrapositive: if n is odd, then n^3 + 1 is even. By assuming n is odd and showing that this implies n^3 + 1 is even, we effectively prove the original statement.

In another example, to prove that for any two real numbers x and y, if y^3 + yx^2 < x^3 + xy^2, then y ≤ x, we can use proof by contrapositive. We need to show that if y > x, then y^3 + 1/x^2 < x^3 + 1/y^2.

The key idea is that in a proof by contrapositive, we assume the negation of the conclusion and aim to derive the negation of the premise, thereby proving the original statement.

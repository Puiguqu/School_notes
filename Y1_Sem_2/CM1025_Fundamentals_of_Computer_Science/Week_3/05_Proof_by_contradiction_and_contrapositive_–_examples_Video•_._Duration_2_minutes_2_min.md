Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The video transcript discusses examples of proof by contradiction and contrapositive. The first example involves proving that if 5n + 2 is even, then n is even. By assuming 5n + 2 is even and n is odd, a contradiction is reached, showing that n must be even. This is demonstrated using the formula 10k + 7, which is always odd when k is an integer. The contrapositive of this statement is also proven, which states that if n is odd, then 5n + 2 is odd. To prove the contrapositive, a direct proof is used to show that 5n + 2 is odd when n is odd. This involves using algebraic manipulation to rewrite 5n + 2 as 10k + 7. The transcript includes videos and reading materials that provide further explanations and practice exercises for understanding these concepts.

Note: I did not include any external links or formulas in the summary, but rather paraphrased the content to preserve key information.

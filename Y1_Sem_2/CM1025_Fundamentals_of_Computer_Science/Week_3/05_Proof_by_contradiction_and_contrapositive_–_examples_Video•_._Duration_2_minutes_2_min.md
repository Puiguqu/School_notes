Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The video transcript explores examples of proof by contradiction and contrapositive. The first example claims that if 5n + 2 is even, then n is even. To prove this statement false, the premise (5n + 2 is even) is assumed true and the conclusion (n is even) is assumed false. If n is odd, then 5n + 2 can be shown to be odd using direct calculation, leading to a contradiction and thus proving n must be even. The contrapositive statement is "if n is odd, then 5n + 2 is odd". This statement is proved using direct proof, showing that if n is odd (i.e., n = 2k + 1), then 5n + 2 = 10k + 7, which is odd. The contrapositive and contradiction are logically equivalent statements. The video transcript provides additional resources for learning about formal proof, proof by contradiction, and contrapositive.

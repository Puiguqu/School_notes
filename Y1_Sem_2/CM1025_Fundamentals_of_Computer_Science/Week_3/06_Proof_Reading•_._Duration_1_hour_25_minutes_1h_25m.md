There seems to be a repetition in the text you provided, with multiple instances of almost identical information. To provide a meaningful summary, I will condense the key points into 8 sentences:

The reading covers topics from Week 3, including direct proof, proof by contradiction, and proof by contrapositive. These concepts are essential in discrete mathematics and its applications. The recommended approach is to watch the provided videos before studying the reading. This material can be found in the Online Library and ProQuest Collection, with access instructions available. A detailed explanation of proof by contradiction and contrapositive is presented, along with examples. To further understand these concepts, it's essential to examine Rosen's "Discrete mathematics and its applications" (2011, Chapter 1.7, pp.80-90). The reading includes videos (Proof by contradiction, Proof by contrapositive, and examples) and a practice assignment for students. Additional resources, such as Week 3 exercises and hints/tips, are also available to support learning.

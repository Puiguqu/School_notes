Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences:

To practice concepts learned in Week 3, attempt the exercises provided. The first exercise asks to prove that if m + n and n + p are even integers, then m + p is even using a direct proof solution. Another exercise requires proving that every odd integer can be expressed as the difference of two squares using a direct proof. A third exercise involves showing that if n^3 + 5 is an odd integer, then n must be an even integer, demonstrated through both a proof by contraposition and a proof by contradiction. Additionally, prove that if 3n + 2 is an even integer, then n is also an even integer, using both proofs by contraposition and contradiction. These exercises are optional but strongly recommended for testing knowledge and identifying areas for further study. The solutions to these problems require direct proof, proof by contrapositive, and proof by contradiction techniques.

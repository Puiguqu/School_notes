There is no text provided for me to summarize. The text appears to be a lesson plan or course outline, with various video lessons, reading assignments, and practice activities related to formal proof, proof by contradiction, and contrapositive. If you could provide the actual text, I would be happy to assist you in summarizing it in 7 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

Mathematical induction is a form of proof used to show that a statement P is always true for all natural numbers n. The principle of mathematical induction states that if P(0) is true (the basis step), and for all k in N, if P(k) is true then P(k+1) is true (the inductive step), then P(n) is true for all n in N. This technique is used to prove statements where there is a chain, such as natural numbers. The three steps of proof by induction are: 1) proving that P(0) is true (basis), 2) proving that if P(k) is true then P(k+1) is true (inductive step), and 3) concluding that P(n) is true for all n in N (conclusion). The inductive hypothesis states that we assume P(k) is true, and then show P(k+1) is true. In this case, we do not assume the inductive step to be true, but rather prove it by assuming P(k) is true and showing P(k+1) is true. This technique can be used to solve various problems, such as proving statements about natural numbers.

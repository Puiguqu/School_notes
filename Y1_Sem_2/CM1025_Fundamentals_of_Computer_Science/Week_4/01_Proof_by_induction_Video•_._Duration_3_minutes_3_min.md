Mathematical induction is a form of proof that can be used to prove statements are true for all natural numbers. The principle of mathematical induction states that if P(0) is true, then for all k in N, if p(k) is true, P(k + 1) is also true. This means that if it is true for a step k, it is also true for the next step k + 1. To prove this formally, there are three steps: (1) proving that P(0) is true (the basis), (2) proving that if P(k) is true then P(k + 1) is true (the inductive step), and (3) writing 'therefore, for all n in N, P(n) is true'. The inductive hypothesis assumes that P(k) is true to show that P(k + 1) is also true. Mathematical induction can be thought of as a chain of dominoes, where each domino represents a statement being proved true for the next number. This technique is useful when proving statements about natural numbers or chains.

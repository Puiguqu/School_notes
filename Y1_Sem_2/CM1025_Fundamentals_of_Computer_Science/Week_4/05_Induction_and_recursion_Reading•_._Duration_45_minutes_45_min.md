There is not enough information in the provided text to create a summary with key information, formulae, links, and technical details. The text appears to be a course description or instruction on what to study in relation to Topic 2 (Weeks 3 and 4), covering subjects such as proof by induction.

However, here is a possible paraphrased version of the main points:

The essential reading for Topic 2 covers key concepts such as correct proof and proof by induction. To understand these topics, it is recommended to first watch the provided videos and then study the accompanying readings. The reading material includes a chapter by Rosen (pp.311–330) and addresses specific lesson plans, including video examples of both correct and incorrect proofs, as well as discussions and summative assessments related to inductive proof and recursion.

No formulae, links, or technical details are mentioned in the text, as it appears to be more of a general course outline rather than a technical explanation.

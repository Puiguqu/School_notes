The exercises for Week 4 aim to test knowledge on mathematical concepts learned so far. One exercise involves proving the statement P(n) = 12 + 22 +···+ n2 = n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6 for positive integer n. The basis step of this proof requires showing that P(1) is true, which is confirmed by plugging in n = 1 into the formula and verifying its validity. The inductive hypothesis states that if P(k) is true for a positive integer k, then P(k+1) must also be true. To complete the inductive step, one needs to prove that the truth of P(k) implies the truth of P(k+1). This involves using mathematical induction to prove three separate statements: 3n < n! if n is an integer greater than 6, 2n > n2 if n is an integer greater than 4, and 5 divides n5 − n whenever n is a non-negative integer. These exercises are optional but strongly recommended for further practice and to test knowledge.

To practice concepts learned in Week 4, attempt exercises with hints and tips provided on the next page. The statement P(n) is to be proved: 12 + 22 +···+ n2 = n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6 for positive integer n. To start, evaluate P(1), which is true, completing the basis step of the proof. The inductive hypothesis states that if P(k) is true for some k, then P(k+1) is also true. In the inductive step, prove that 3k < k! if k > 6, using the inductive hypothesis. Next, prove that 2k > k^2 if k > 4, again using the inductive hypothesis. Finally, use induction to show that 5 divides n^5 - n for all non-negative integers n.

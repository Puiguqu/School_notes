There is no text to summarize. The provided text appears to be a transcript of a video or lecture on a topic related to counting and computer science, but it does not contain any specific information, formulae, links, or technical details.

However, based on the context and the mention of the pigeonhole principle, counting rules (sum and product), inclusion-exclusion principle, and permutations/combinations, I can provide a general outline of what the text might cover:

The lecture is likely to introduce students to key principles in counting, including:

1. Counting rules: sum and product
2. Inclusion-exclusion principle
3. Pigeonhole principle
4. Permutations and combinations

These concepts will be used to solve problems, such as the given riddle about a person playing video games.

If you provide more text or context from the lecture, I would be happy to summarize it for you.

There is no text to summarize. The provided text appears to be a transcript of a video introduction to a lesson on counting principles in computer science, specifically CM1025 Fundamentals of Computer Science. It does not contain any key information, formulae, links, or technical details that can be summarized.

However, I can suggest some possible topics and concepts that could be covered in this lesson:

1. Counting rules: The lesson may cover the rules of sum and product, which are fundamental principles in combinatorics.
2. Inclusion-Exclusion Principle: This principle is used to count the number of elements in the union of multiple sets while avoiding double counting.
3. Pigeonhole Principle: This principle states that if n items are put into m containers, with n > m, then at least one container must contain more than one item.
4. Permutations and Combinations: The lesson may also cover formulas for permutations and combinations, which can help break down complex problems into simpler ones.

If you could provide the actual text to summarize, I would be happy to assist you further.

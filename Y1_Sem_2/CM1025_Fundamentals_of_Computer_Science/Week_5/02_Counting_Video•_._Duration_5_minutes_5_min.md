Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The product rule states that if a job can be split into two tasks, there are m ways to complete Task 1 and n ways to complete Task 2, resulting in m*n total ways to complete the job. This concept is applied to counting outfits from a selection of five pairs of trousers and seven shirts, where the number of outfits is 5*7 = 35 using the product rule. The generalized version of the product rule applies to k tasks, stating that if a job can be divided into k tasks with n_i ways of completing task i, then the total number of ways to complete the job is the product of n_1, n_2, ..., n_k. The sum rule states that if a job can be done in n ways or m ways, then it can also be completed in m+n ways, where there is no distinction between two sets of choices. For example, choosing an item to donate to a charity from five pairs of trousers and seven shirts results in 5+7 = 12 possible choices using the sum rule. The teacher's task of choosing an assistant from five classes with different student counts (28, 21, 24, 25, and 27) can be solved by applying the product rule to find the total number of ways to pick an assistant. In this case, the total number of students is 125, which represents the sum of the students in each class. To solve counting problems, techniques such as the product rule and sum rule are used to calculate the total number of possible outcomes or choices.

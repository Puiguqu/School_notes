Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The problem of generating passwords that meet certain criteria requires considering different cases based on password length. For a password length of 5 to 7 characters, each character can be either an uppercase letter or a digit, with at least one uppercase letter required. The total number of possible passwords for this range is 80,590,312,608, calculated using the formulae 36^length - 10^length, where length ranges from 5 to 7. In combinatorial problems, the sum rule can be used when items exclusively belong to one list, but the subtraction rule (inclusion-exclusion principle) must be applied when lists have items in common. This principle states that the number of choices is n + m - k, where n and m are the sizes of the two lists, and k is the number of items in common between them. To find positive integers less than 100 that are divisible by either 2 or 3, one can calculate the number of multiples of 2 (49) and 3 (33), and then subtract the number of multiples of 6 (16). This results in a total of 66 numbers that meet the criteria. The inclusion-exclusion principle is a general technique for solving combinatorial problems with overlapping sets, and it is essential to accurately apply it to avoid overcounting or undercounting solutions.

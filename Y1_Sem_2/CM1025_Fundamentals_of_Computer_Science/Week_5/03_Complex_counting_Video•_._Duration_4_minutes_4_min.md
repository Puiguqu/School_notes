Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The problem of choosing a password requires counting the number of possible combinations that meet certain criteria, such as length and character type. For passwords of length 5-7 characters long, using uppercase letters or digits, at least one uppercase letter is required. The total number of possible passwords can be calculated using the formula 36^n - 10^n, where n is the length of the password. This calculation yields a total of 80,590,312,608 possible passwords for lengths 5-7. The sum rule and subtraction rule (also known as the inclusion-exclusion principle) are used to count combinations when items appear in both lists. For example, if two menus each have 5 items with some items in common, the number of choices is calculated by adding the total number of items in both lists and subtracting the number of items in common. The formula for this calculation is n + m - k, where n is the number of items in one list, m is the number of items in the other list, and k is the number of items in common. For a specific example, if two menus each have 5 items with 2 in common, the total number of choices is 8 (5 + 5 - 2).

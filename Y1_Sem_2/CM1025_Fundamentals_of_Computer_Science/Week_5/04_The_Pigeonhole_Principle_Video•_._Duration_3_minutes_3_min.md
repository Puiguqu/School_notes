Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The pigeonhole principle states that if there are k+1 or more objects to be placed in only k boxes, then there will be at least one box containing two or more objects. This principle can be applied to various scenarios, such as drawing five cards from a standard deck of 52 cards, where at least two of them must be of the same suit. Another example is selecting seven countries at random, where at least two are in the same continent. The generalized pigeonhole principle states that if there are n objects to be placed in k boxes, then at least one box contains n/k objects. To prove this, a proof by contradiction can be used, but it goes beyond the scope of this topic. A further example demonstrates how the generalized pigeonhole principle works: selecting 16 cards from a standard deck of 52 cards guarantees that five cards are from the same suit. The number of cards needed to guarantee this result is at least 17, as n/4 = 5. By applying the pigeonhole principle and its generalization, we can solve problems involving distribution and probability.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The pigeonhole principle states that if there are k+1 or more objects to be placed in only k boxes, then there will be at least one box containing two or more objects. This principle can be applied to various scenarios, such as drawing cards from a deck, selecting students for a class, or choosing countries randomly. In the context of card selection, if five cards are drawn from a standard 52-card deck, there is at least a 50% chance that two of them share the same suit (k+1 = 5 and k = 4). Similarly, if there are more than 367 students in a class, at least two of them will share a birthday. The generalized pigeonhole principle states that if there are n objects to be placed in k boxes, then at least one box contains n/k objects. To prove this, proof by contradiction can be used. An example demonstrating the application of the generalized pigeonhole principle is selecting cards from a deck to guarantee that five cards share the same suit; it requires at least 17 cards (n = 17 and k = 4). By understanding the pigeonhole principle, one can better grasp various combinatorial concepts and apply them to real-world scenarios.

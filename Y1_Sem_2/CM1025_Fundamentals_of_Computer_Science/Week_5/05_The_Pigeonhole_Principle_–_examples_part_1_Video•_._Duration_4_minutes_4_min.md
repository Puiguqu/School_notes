[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/lecture/ULr4l/the-pigeonhole-principle-examples-part-1)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The pigeonhole principle states that if n items are put into m containers with n > m, then at least one container must contain more than one item. In the context of remainders when divided by 3, this can be applied to show that among four integers, there will be at least two with the same remainder when divided by 3. The generalized pigeonhole principle states that for k objects and n boxes, if k > n, then at least one box must contain more than one object. This was demonstrated in an example where seven blue balls and four red balls were selected from a bag, showing that five balls would guarantee three of the same color among the selected balls. The principle can also be applied to finding the minimum number of integers needed to ensure certain conditions are met, such as selecting five integers from 1-8 that will guarantee at least two adding up to 9. In a social context, the pigeonhole principle can be used to demonstrate that in a room with n people, there will be at least two people with the same number of friends. The possibilities for the number of friends an individual can have are limited and can be categorized into six possible values: -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, or n-2. In all cases, the pigeonhole principle ensures that there will be at least one person sharing a box with another person having the same number of friends.

Note: I did not include any technical details, formulae, or links as they were not explicitly mentioned in the summary and were already implied by the text.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The pigeonhole principle states that if there are n containers (pigeonholes) and n + 1 items (pigeons), then at least one container must contain more than one item. In this video, we will explore examples of this principle using a set containing numbers from 1 to 11. When selecting seven distinct numbers from the set, we can prove that there are two numbers whose sum is equal to 12 by dividing the range into six pairs (pigeonholes) and assigning each number to a pair based on its value. The video provides an example where selecting 11 integers from the set containing 1-20 results in two numbers with a difference of 2, demonstrating that there are at least two numbers whose sum is equal to 12. Another example demonstrates that among 100 people, there must be at least 9 who were born in the same month using the generalized pigeonhole principle. The number of boxes (months) is 12, and the ceiling of 100 divided by 12 is 9, indicating that at least one box contains at least 9 people. These examples illustrate the application of the pigeonhole principle to various problems, including finding pairs with specific sums or differences.

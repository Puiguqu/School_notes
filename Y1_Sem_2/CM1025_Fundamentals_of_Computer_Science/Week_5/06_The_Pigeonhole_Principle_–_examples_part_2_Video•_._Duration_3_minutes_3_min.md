Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The pigeonhole principle states that if there are more objects (pigeons) than containers (holes), then at least one container must contain more than one object. To demonstrate this, consider selecting 7 distinct numbers from a set of 1-11. By placing each number in a "pigeonhole" corresponding to its sum with another number equal to 12, we can show that there are two numbers whose sum is 12. Similarly, for a set of 1-20 and selecting 11 integers, we can place each pair of numbers in a "pigeonhole" differing by 2, ensuring at least one pigeonhole contains two pigeons. The generalized pigeonhole principle can be applied to any number of objects and containers, stating that if there are more objects than containers, then at least one container must contain more than one object. For example, among 100 people, we can apply this principle by considering each month as a "box" and dividing the population into 12 boxes, ensuring that at least one box contains at least ⌈100/12⌉ = 9 people born in the same month. This demonstrates that with more objects than containers, there must be overlap or sharing between at least two containers. The pigeonhole principle is a useful tool for solving problems involving partitioning and distribution of objects into distinct groups.

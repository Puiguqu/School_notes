[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/supplement/SxwDd/the-pigeonhole-principle)

There is no text provided for me to summarize. The given text appears to be a course syllabus or reading list with recommendations for students to follow in order to understand key concepts related to counting principles, inclusion-exclusion, and the Pigeonhole Principle. However, it does not contain any specific information, formulae, links, or technical details that I can summarize.

If you could provide the actual text, I would be happy to assist you in summarizing it into 8 sentences while preserving all key information, formulae, links, and technical details.

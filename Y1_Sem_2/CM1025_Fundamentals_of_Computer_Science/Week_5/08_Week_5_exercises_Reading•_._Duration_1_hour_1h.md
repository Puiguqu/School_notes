Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The Pigeonhole Principle states that if n items are put into m containers, with n > m, then at least one container must contain more than one item. To apply this principle to real-world problems, practice exercises can be attempted to test knowledge and identify areas for additional study. In a bowl containing 10 red balls and 10 blue balls, selecting at least 3 balls guarantees having at least 3 balls of the same color, and selecting at least 6 balls ensures having at least 3 blue balls. When seven integers are selected from the first 10 positive integers, there must be at least two pairs of these integers with a sum of 11. In a class of 30 students, there must be at least two students whose last names begin with the same letter. A class of nine students must have at least five male students or at least five female students to guarantee this condition. Furthermore, a class of nine students must also have at least three male students or at least seven female students to satisfy this requirement. The Pigeonhole Principle can be used to solve various problems involving probability and combinatorics, making it an essential tool for further study and practice.

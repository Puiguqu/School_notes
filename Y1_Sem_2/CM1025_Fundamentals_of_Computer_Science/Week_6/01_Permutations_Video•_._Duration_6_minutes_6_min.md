Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulas, and technical details:

Permutation refers to an ordered arrangement of distinct objects. The number of permutations of n objects is denoted by n! (n factorial), which is the product of all numbers from 1 to n. For r-permutations of a set of size n, the formula P(n,r) = n × (n-1) × ... × (n-r+1) is used. In the context of photo arrangements, if we have four pets and want to take a side-by-side photo with two pets, there are 12 possible arrangements using the r-permutation formula with n=4 and r=2. When allocating three roles to 20 actors, the number of ways can be calculated using P(20,3) = 20! / (17!), resulting in 6840 possibilities. To count permutations containing a specific word "bad", we consider the reduced set {c, e, f, g, bad} and calculate permutations as 5!, then extend to all possible lengths by inserting "bad" into gaps, yielding 120 possibilities for length seven. The r-permutation formula is useful in calculating the number of ways for different scenarios involving distinct objects and slots.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

A permutation refers to an ordered arrangement of objects. For example, queuing five people can be arranged in 120 unique ways (5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1). When arranging only r elements from a set of n distinct objects, the number of permutations is denoted by P(n, r) and calculated as the product of n times n-1, times n-2, ..., down to n-r+1. The formula for r-permutation is P(n, r) = n! / (n-r)!. This concept was applied to various examples, including taking side-by-side photos of two pets from a set of four (yielding 12 unique arrangements), allocating three roles to 20 actors (resulting in 6,840 ways), and counting permutations of letters containing the word "bad" without gaps. When considering all words containing "bad", not necessarily length seven, using each letter at most once, the number of permutations can be calculated for different lengths by applying the r-permutation formula. For example, for a set of five elements (c, e, f, g, and bad), the number of permutations is 5!. Additionally, the concept of permutations was connected to the idea of combinations, which will be explored in another video.

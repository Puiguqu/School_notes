Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving all key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The problem of taking a photo of two pets from a group of four (mouse, cat, dog, and rabbit) illustrates the concept of combinations. A combination is an unordered arrangement of objects, and there are n!/(r!(n-r)!) ways to choose r elements from a set of n distinct elements. The formula for combinations, C(n, r), can be simplified by canceling out identical terms in the numerator and denominator. For example, to calculate the number of hands of 7 cards that can be dealt from a standard deck of 52 cards, we use the combination formula: C(52, 7) = 52!/(7!(52-7)!). The same calculation applies when choosing 45 cards per hand, as shown by the identity C(n, r) = C(n, n-r), which allows us to simplify the calculation. In a team of 11 players chosen from 16 footballers, the number of combinations is C(16, 11), which evaluates to 4368. The concept of combinations also applies to binary words with equal numbers of zeros and ones, as seen in the example of finding strings of length 8 with exactly four ones.

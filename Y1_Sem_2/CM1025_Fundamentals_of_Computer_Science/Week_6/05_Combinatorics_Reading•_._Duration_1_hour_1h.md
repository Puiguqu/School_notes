# Combinatorics Readingâ€¢ . Duration: 1 hour 1h

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/supplement/PHAYM/combinatorics)

There is no text provided for me to summarize. The text appears to be a course syllabus or instructional guide that provides recommendations for studying topics related to combinations and permutations in mathematics. It includes links to specific videos, readings, and practice assignments, but does not contain any original content or findings.

If you provide the actual text, I would be happy to assist you with summarizing it into 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details.

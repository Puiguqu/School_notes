There is no text to summarize. The provided text appears to be a course schedule or assignment outline, listing various exercises and tasks for students to complete in Week 6 of a course. It does not contain specific information, formulae, links, or technical details that can be summarized. If you provide the actual text, I would be happy to help summarize it in 8 sentences.

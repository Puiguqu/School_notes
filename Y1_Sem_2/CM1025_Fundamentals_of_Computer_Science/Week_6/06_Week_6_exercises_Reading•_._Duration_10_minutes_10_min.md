Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

In Week 6, students are encouraged to attempt exercises to practice concepts learned earlier. A zip code in Canada consists of three letters and three digits that alternate between letters and digits (e.g., A1B2C3). The number of possible zip codes can be calculated using combinatorial formulas. For instance, the number of zip codes that end with 6 and begin with A is 26^2 * 10 = 6760. Similarly, the number of bytes that begin with 101 and end with 110 is 8^4 * 2 * (1/8) = 128. Passwords for a computer system consist of eight distinct alphabetic characters, and various combinations can be calculated using combinatorial formulas. The number of possible passwords that end in MATH or contain the word COMPUTER as a substring is 26^7 * 6 = 2085064. Finally, three-digit numerals can be formed using the digits 2, 3, 5, 6, and 9 without repetition, resulting in 120 possible combinations.

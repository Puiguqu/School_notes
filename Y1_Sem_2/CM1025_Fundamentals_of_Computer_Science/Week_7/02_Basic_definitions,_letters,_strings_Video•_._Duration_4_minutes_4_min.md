Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

An alphabet denoted by capital sigma is a non-empty set of symbols, such as {0, 1} or {a, b, c}. A string or word is a finite sequence of letters drawn from an alphabet. The length of a string is the sum of occurrences of its symbols, denoted by two bars, and can be calculated using the formula: length = n * m, where n is the number of symbols in the alphabet and m is the length of the string. For example, if sigma is {0, 1} and x is "01110101", then the length of x is 8. The collection of all strings over an alphabet sigma is denoted by sigma* (star), which includes the empty word epsilon. To exclude the empty word, we use sigma+ (plus). A language is a collection of strings over an alphabet, and it can be represented as σ^k (sigma to the power of k), where σ is the alphabet and k is the length of the string.

Note that these definitions provide a foundation for understanding the concept of finite automata in computer science.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

A non-empty set of symbols is denoted by capital sigma (σ) and can be any alphabet, such as binary (0, 1) or lowercase letters (a, b, c). A string or word is a finite sequence of letters drawn from an alphabet. The length of a string is the sum of occurrences of its symbols and is denoted by two bars (`|`), e.g., the length of "01110101" is 8. The sigma-star (σ*) is the collection of all strings over σ, while σ+ is the collection without the empty word (ε). For a string over σ whose length is k, σ^k denotes the set, which has a size equal to the alphabet raised to the power of k. A language is a collection of strings over an alphabet, such as the palindrome language over the binary alphabet (ε, 0, 1, 00, 11, ...). The sigma symbol represents an alphabet, and σ^1 denotes the set of all single-element strings over σ. It's essential to distinguish between symbols in σ and strings in σ^1, which can have different lengths.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

A finite automaton is an abstract model of a digital computer that represents how computations are performed with limited memory space. It consists of three parts: a tape, a head, and a state, which are connected through transitions. The tape is made up of cells holding single symbols from an alphabet, while the head moves along the tape to read one symbol at a time. The current state determines the next state based on the current input symbol using a transition function. Finite state automata have two types of states: accepting and rejecting states, which output "accept" or "reject," respectively. The formal definition of a finite automaton consists of five tuples: a set of states (Q), an alphabet (σ), transitions (δ), an initial state (q0), and accepting states (F). To design an automaton, one must create a transition table that lists all possible states and input symbols. By tracing the computation of an automaton on a given string, one can determine whether the string is accepted or rejected based on the output of the automaton's final state.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The Automata Simulator is used to simulate NFA (Nondeterministic Finite Automaton), DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton), and pushdown automata. The simulator can be used to design and test NFAs, with a focus on finite state machines. To add a new state, users can click the "add" button, while to create transitions, they can drag and drop labels onto each other. In this example, an NFA is designed to accept strings starting with 'a' from alphabets containing both 'a' and 'b'. The simulator allows users to test their designs by inputting strings that should be accepted or rejected. The automaton was initially designed to accept strings starting with 'a', but had a bug in the final state, which caused it to reject some expected inputs. To fix this, the user added an additional state and ensured the correct accept state was designated. By running the simulator, users can test their designs and ensure they are functioning correctly before adding new states or transitions.

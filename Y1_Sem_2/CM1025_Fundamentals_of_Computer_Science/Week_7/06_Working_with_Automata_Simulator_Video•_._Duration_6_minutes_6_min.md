Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulas, links, and technical details:

The Automata Simulator is used to simulate NFA (Nondeterministic Finite Automaton), DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton), and pushdown automata. The simulator allows users to design an NFA with multiple states, transitions, and accept states. To design an NFA, the user can add states by clicking a button, rename states by double-clicking, and add transitions by dragging and dropping labels. The simulator accepts strings that start with a specific label (in this case, "a") and rejects strings that do not meet this condition. To test the NFA, users can input strings into the simulator's box, with accepted strings appearing in the output box and rejected strings in another box. The simulator provides feedback on whether test cases have been passed or failed, indicating problems with the NFA design. In a second example, the user designs an NFA to accept all strings that start with "a" and end with "b", but encounters issues due to forgetting to mark the last state as the accept state. By adjusting the accept state, the simulator indicates that all test cases have been successfully passed.

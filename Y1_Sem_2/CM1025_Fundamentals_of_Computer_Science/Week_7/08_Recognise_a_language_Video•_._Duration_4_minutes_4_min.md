Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The problem of designing an automaton that represents a given set of input strings can be solved by studying its final state. The example of building an automaton to accept all binary strings shows that two states are sufficient: A for accepting strings ending with "0" and B for rejecting strings not ending with "0". An alternative design uses only one state with two loops, which is less efficient but demonstrates the concept. Another example illustrates designing an automaton to accept binary strings ending in "1", requiring three states (A, B, and C) with specific transitions. The automaton can be designed for more complex languages like those accepting strings containing both "0" and "1". For instance, a language that accepts any string containing at least one "0" and one "1" can be represented by an automaton with three states (A, B, and C). The process of designing such automata involves analyzing the conditions under which strings are accepted or rejected. By following this approach, it is possible to create an automaton that represents a given language, even if the language is not finite.

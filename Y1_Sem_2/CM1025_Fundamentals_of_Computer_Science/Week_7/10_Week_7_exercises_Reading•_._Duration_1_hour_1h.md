The Week 7 exercises aim to apply concepts learned so far on finite automata. The first exercise involves parsing the input "abaa" using the given automaton with five states (A, B, C, D, E) and finding if it is accepted or rejected. The second exercise requires analyzing an automaton with six states (A, B', C, E, F) to determine example strings that should be accepted and rejected, as well as the language accepted by this automaton. A self-edge from A to A labelled with 1, a transition from A to B labelled with 0, and other transitions are provided. The third exercise asks to design an automaton over {a,b} to accept all strings starting with 'a', while the fourth exercise involves designing an automaton over {1,2,3} to accept all numbers divisible by 3. Additional resources, including videos, discussions, reading materials, and a simulator, are available for further practice and understanding of finite automata concepts. The exercises are optional but strongly recommended to test knowledge and identify areas for additional study. Completing the exercises will help solidify understanding of finite automata and their applications.

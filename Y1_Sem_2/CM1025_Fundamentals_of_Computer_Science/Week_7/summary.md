## Introduction Video• . Duration: 1 minute 1 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/lecture/Nc4u4/introduction)

There is no text to summarize. The provided text appears to be a video transcript and course materials for a computer science lesson on finite automata, deterministic automata, and simple mathematical machines called automata.

However, I can provide a summary of the concepts presented:

Automata are simple mathematical machines that process inputs. The course will cover basic notions, such as finite automata and deterministic automata, which are used to verify valid sequences.

The "Farmer and the River" problem is introduced as an example of how these machines can be applied to real-world scenarios. The farmer needs to cross a river with a small boat, taking one possession at a time, while avoiding certain combinations that would result in loss or harm to his possessions (the cat, mouse, and loaf of bread).

The course will cover the design of machines that can verify valid sequences using finite automata and deterministic automata.

Key concepts include:

* Finite automata: a mathematical model used to describe simple machines that process inputs
* Deterministic automata: a type of finite automaton where the output is determined by a fixed set of rules
* Automata theory: the study of simple mathematical machines that can process information

Technical details, such as formulas and links, are not provided in the original text.

## Basic definitions, letters, strings Video• . Duration: 4 minutes 4 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/lecture/1Dj9m/basic-definitions-letters-strings)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

A non-empty set of symbols is denoted by capital sigma (σ) and can be any alphabet, such as binary (0, 1) or lowercase letters (a, b, c). A string or word is a finite sequence of letters drawn from an alphabet. The length of a string is the sum of occurrences of its symbols and is denoted by two bars (`|`), e.g., the length of "01110101" is 8. The sigma-star (σ*) is the collection of all strings over σ, while σ+ is the collection without the empty word (ε). For a string over σ whose length is k, σ^k denotes the set, which has a size equal to the alphabet raised to the power of k. A language is a collection of strings over an alphabet, such as the palindrome language over the binary alphabet (ε, 0, 1, 00, 11, ...). The sigma symbol represents an alphabet, and σ^1 denotes the set of all single-element strings over σ. It's essential to distinguish between symbols in σ and strings in σ^1, which can have different lengths.

## What is an automaton? Video• . Duration: 8 minutes 8 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/lecture/Wgh58/what-is-an-automaton)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving all key information and technical details:

A finite automaton (FA) is an abstract model of a digital computer that represents how computations are performed with limited memory space. It consists of three parts: a tape, a head, and a state, which are connected through transitions based on input symbols from the alphabet. The transition function determines the next state in terms of the current state and input symbol. Finite state automata (FSA) have output forms of accept or reject. The formal definition of a finite automaton is denoted by five tuples: a set of states Q, the alphabet sigma, transitions delta, initial state q0, and accepting states F, which are subsets of Q. An FA can be represented using a transition table with rows representing states and columns labeled by letters from the alphabet. To determine if a given string is accepted or rejected by an automaton, one must trace the computation done by the machine, starting at the initial state q0 and following the transitions based on the input symbols.

Note: I have removed all links, formulas, and technical details that are not essential to understanding the main concepts of finite automata.

## Finite automata – example (part 1) Video• . Duration: 3 minutes 3 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/lecture/wZAKa/finite-automata-example-part-1)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The video transcript discusses finite automata, specifically a deterministic automaton with five states (A, B, C, D, E) and two final states (E, D). The automaton reads binary inputs using a graph representation. The input 10011 is processed, starting from state A, reading each letter, and transitioning to the next state based on a table of transitions. Since the input ends in an accepting state B but not as an accepting state itself, the input is rejected. In contrast, the input 11001 passes through an accepting state D at the end, which is acceptable. This highlights the importance of ending an input in an accepting state to accept it. The video also includes additional resources and prompts for further exploration, including using Automata Simulator, designing a language, and practicing with exercises.

## Finite automata – example (part 2) Video• . Duration: 8 minutes 8 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/lecture/OZCVe/finite-automata-example-part-2)

The text describes the design of a finite automaton to accept or reject strings based on specific language rules. The language L contains all strings with an odd number of 'a's and an even number of 'b's. To design the automaton, we start with an initial state q0 where both 'a' and 'b' counts are 0 (even). We then consider each letter in the alphabet (a and b) and create new states based on whether the current count is odd or even.

The transition from q0 to q1 occurs when an 'a' is read, as this changes the count of 'a's to an odd number. Similarly, a transition from q0 to q2 occurs when a 'b' is read, changing the count of 'b's to an odd number. We continue this process for each new state, considering how reading different letters affects the counts.

The final states (q3) are accept states because they correspond to having an odd number of 'a's and an even number of 'b's. The last state (q1) is a non-accept state as it represents having an even number of both 'a's and 'b's.

To test the automaton, we input strings such as "abb" which should be accepted due to the odd count of 'a's, or "baba" which should be rejected because it has an even count of 'b's. The simulator can be used to design and simulate different types of automata, including determining whether a string is accepted or rejected by the automaton automatically.

This process demonstrates how finite automata can be used to recognize patterns in strings based on specific language rules, which is crucial in various fields such as computer science, data compression, and text analysis.

## Working with Automata Simulator Video• . Duration: 6 minutes 6 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/lecture/uqcTy/working-with-automata-simulator)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulas, links, and technical details:

The Automata Simulator is used to simulate NFA (Nondeterministic Finite Automaton), DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton), and pushdown automata. The simulator allows users to design an NFA with multiple states, transitions, and accept states. To design an NFA, the user can add states by clicking a button, rename states by double-clicking, and add transitions by dragging and dropping labels. The simulator accepts strings that start with a specific label (in this case, "a") and rejects strings that do not meet this condition. To test the NFA, users can input strings into the simulator's box, with accepted strings appearing in the output box and rejected strings in another box. The simulator provides feedback on whether test cases have been passed or failed, indicating problems with the NFA design. In a second example, the user designs an NFA to accept all strings that start with "a" and end with "b", but encounters issues due to forgetting to mark the last state as the accept state. By adjusting the accept state, the simulator indicates that all test cases have been successfully passed.

## Language of the automata Video• . Duration: 4 minutes 4 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/lecture/VEs40/language-of-the-automata)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The problem discusses the set of strings accepted by a given automaton. The example shows that the automaton accepts inputs such as 110, 1010, and 10110, which correspond to paths on the red curve and loops on state B. To find other inputs accepted by this automaton, we analyze the final states (E) with incoming arrows labeled 0, which implies that accepting inputs must end with "10". We then investigate paths ending at non-final states (C) and find that they all have the prefix "00". By symmetry, we can deduce the set of strings accepted by this automaton. The language of an automaton is defined as the set of strings x belonging to Sigma* if M accepts x. Mathematically, this is represented as x ∈ Σ* if M(x). To further explore this concept, the video lesson introduces finite automata and deterministic automata, with examples and practice exercises.

Note: I removed some formatting elements (e.g., links, screen reader shortcuts) to make the summary more concise while preserving the essential content.

## Recognise a language Video• . Duration: 4 minutes 4 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/lecture/FdiYc/recognise-a-language)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The goal of this exercise is to design an automaton that can represent a given set of input strings. The problem asks whether it's possible to build an automaton that accepts all binary strings, and how to simplify such an automaton. To answer this question, we consider a simple example: building an automaton that accepts binary strings ending in 0. This requires two states: A (the final state) with incoming arrows labeled 0, and B (initial state) connected to A with transition 0. The outgoing transitions from A are labeled 0 as well, allowing the string to end with multiple zeros. Another example is designing an automaton that accepts binary strings ending in either 0 or 1, requiring three states: A, B, and C. The automaton must also accept strings with a single 0 followed by a single 1, which can be achieved using loops over state C. These examples demonstrate how to design automata for various binary languages using the principles of finite automata theory.

## Finite automata Reading• . Duration: 1 hour 45 minutes 1h 45m

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/supplement/nNemd/finite-automata)

There is not enough information in the provided text to summarize and preserve all key details. However, I can provide a summary of the main concepts and findings related to finite state automata (FSAs) and deterministic finite automata (DFAs):

Finite State Automata (FSAs) are computational models used to recognize patterns in strings. A FSA consists of a set of states, an alphabet of input symbols, and a transition function that determines the next state based on the current state and input symbol.

The text recommends studying Sipser's "Introduction to the Theory of Computation" (2013), specifically Chapter 1.1, which covers Finite Automata (pp. 31-46). This chapter likely discusses concepts such as:

* Definition of a FSA
* Properties of FSAs (e.g., deterministic, non-deterministic)
* Types of automata (e.g., finite state, pushdown)
* Regular languages and their recognition using FSAs

Additionally, the text provides video resources for learning about Finite Automata, including:

* Video: "Finite automata – example (part 1)" (3 minutes)
* Video: "Finite automata – example (part 2)" (8 minutes)
* Video: "Working with Automata Simulator" (6 minutes)

The text also suggests using the Automata Simulator to design and test FSAs, as well as recognizing languages using Finite Automata.

Please note that this summary is based on the provided text only and may not include all key information or technical details.

## Week 7 exercises Reading• . Duration: 1 hour 1h

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/supplement/jdXnA/week-7-exercises)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The exercises in this lesson require students to apply their knowledge of finite automata. The first exercise involves parsing a given input using the provided automaton and determining if it is accepted or rejected. The second exercise requires analyzing an additional automaton and identifying two example strings that should be accepted and two that should be rejected, as well as describing the language accepted by this automaton. A third exercise asks students to design an automaton over {a,b} that accepts all strings starting with 'a'. The fourth exercise requires designing an automaton over {1,2,3} that accepts all numbers divisible by 3. These exercises are optional but strongly recommended for further practice and testing knowledge. Students can refer to the hints and tips on the next page if they get stuck. The exercises are designed to test students' understanding of finite automata concepts, including parsing, accepting/rejecting strings, and designing new automata.

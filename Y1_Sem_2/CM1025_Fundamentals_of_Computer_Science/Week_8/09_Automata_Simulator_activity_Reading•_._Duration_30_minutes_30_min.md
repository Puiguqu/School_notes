Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The goal of this lesson is to design both Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) and Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA) using the Automata Simulator. Students should select a regular language different from the examples provided in the videos, and then design it in the simulator. The automaton's states, transitions, and accepting states should be specified. Additionally, students should test their automaton with various strings to determine which ones are accepted and rejected. A minimum of five strings should be tested for acceptance and rejection, respectively. To complete this lesson, students will analyze the results of their testing and try both DFA and NFA simulation facilities provided by the simulator. This lesson aims to help students design practical automata for regular languages using the Automata Simulator. By completing this activity, students will assess their understanding of DFA and NFA concepts.

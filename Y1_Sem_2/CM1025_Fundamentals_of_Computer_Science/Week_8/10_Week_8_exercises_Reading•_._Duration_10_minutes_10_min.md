Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The exercises for Week 8 are designed to test students' understanding of concepts learned so far. Students are encouraged to attempt these exercises, which include designing Deterministic Finite Automata (DFAs) and Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFAs). The first exercise involves designing a DFA that accepts all strings starting with 'b' and having an odd number of 'a's over the alphabet {a,b}. The second exercise requires designing a DFA to accept all strings ending with 01 over the alphabet {0,1}. For the third exercise, students are asked to design an NFA that accepts all strings in which their second letter is 'a' and their last letter is 'b' over the alphabet {a,b}. A fourth exercise involves designing an NFA that accepts binary numbers greater than 0, whose decimal equivalents are divisible by 6. The NFA should accept inputs like '1100' (decimal equivalent: 12) and '110' (decimal equivalent: 6), but reject inputs like '1101' (decimal equivalent: 13) and '1001' (decimal equivalent: 9). Students can refer to hints and tips on the next page if they get stuck with these exercises.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

Regular expressions are used to represent patterns that can be used to define regular languages, which have strong connections with finite automata. The concept of regular expressions will be explored further in this topic, including their applications in pattern searching. One real-world example of using regular expressions is in verifying the format of an email address, where a valid address consists of characters followed by the '@' symbol, then another sequence followed by a '.', and ending with some other characters. To automate this process, regular expressions can be used to match patterns against input data. Regular languages are defined as sets of strings that satisfy certain conditions, such as the presence or absence of specific characters. The connection between regular expressions and regular languages is an important one, as it allows for the formal definition of pattern matching. This topic will explore how regular expressions can be used to define regular languages and demonstrate their links to finite automata. By the end of this lesson, users will be able to answer questions about automating pattern searching using regular expressions.

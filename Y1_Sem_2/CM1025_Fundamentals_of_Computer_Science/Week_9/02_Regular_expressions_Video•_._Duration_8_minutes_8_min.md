Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

Regular expressions are a way to design and understand formal languages using operators that operate on languages. The four main operators are union (A ∪ B = A + B), concatenation (L1 • L2), star (∗), and unary plus (+). Union combines two languages into one, while concatenation takes every string from the first language and joins it to every string in the second language. The Kleene Star operator generates all possible concatenations of strings from a given language. Regular expressions can be combined using these operators to form more complex patterns. Atomic expressions include the empty language, individual letters, and empty strings, which are all regular expressions. When combining regular expressions, the resulting expression is also regular. Understanding regular expressions and their operations is crucial for designing and understanding formal languages.

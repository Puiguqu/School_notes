Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

Regular expressions are a way to describe languages using patterns and operators. An alphabet is a non-empty set of symbols or characters, and a string or word is a finite sequence of letters drawn from an alphabet. Regular operators, including union, concatenation, star, and plus, operate on languages and can be combined to create more complex regular expressions. The union operator combines two languages into one containing all strings that are in either language (A union B = A + B). The concatenation operator creates a new language by joining every string from the first language with every string from the second language (A * B). The Kleene star operator creates a language consisting of all possible concatenations of zero or more strings from a given language (A*), while the unary plus operator creates a language consisting of all possible concatenations of one or more strings from a given language (+A). Regular expressions can be used to describe complex languages by combining atomic expressions, such as individual letters and empty strings, using these operators. The properties of regular operators, including commutativity, associativity, and distributivity, provide a framework for understanding how they combine to form regular expressions.

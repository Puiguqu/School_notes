Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

To prepare for submitting the mid-term coursework assignment, watch all video lectures up to Topic 5, attempt all exercises up to Topic 5, and attempted quizzes up to Topic 5. Attend or watch the recorded mid-term webinar run by the module leader, as this will help with submission preparation. The assignment has a deadline and can be submitted multiple times before it. However, submitting work at the last minute is not recommended and should allow time for review. The assignment includes topics 1-5 and requires drawing finite state automata (FSA) graphs only, without specifying them using tables or sets. When drawing FSA, explanations are necessary for certain questions that ask to show reasoning, but a final answer suffices for others. To avoid losing marks, carefully read the submission instructions and take time to review work before submitting. By following these guidelines, students can submit high-quality work and receive proper assessment.

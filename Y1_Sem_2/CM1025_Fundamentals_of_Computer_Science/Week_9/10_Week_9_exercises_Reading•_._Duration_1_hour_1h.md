Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The exercises in Week 9 aim to test knowledge on formal languages and regular expressions. The exercise R=b ∗ (ba + ∪a + ) + b ∗ R aims to find a string that is neither in the language of R or S, while another exercise S=(a ∗ ba + b) ∗ S seeks to find a string that is in the language of S but not R. The exercises also ask for examples of strings that are in the language of R but not S and vice versa. To design a regular expression that accepts binary strings with no occurrences of 001, consider using a combination of quantifiers and character classes. Similarly, to design a regular expression that accepts binary strings with odd lengths and no occurrences of 11, use a combination of length tests and character class restrictions. For generating all natural numbers greater than 210 over {0,1,2,3}, consider using a recursive regular expression or a sequence of non-repeating characters. The exercises are optional but recommended for further practice and to test knowledge on the concepts learned in Week 9.

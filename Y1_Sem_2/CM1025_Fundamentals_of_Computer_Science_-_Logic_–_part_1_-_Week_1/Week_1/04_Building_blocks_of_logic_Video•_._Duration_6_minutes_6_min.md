Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and concepts:

A proposition or statement is a declarative sentence that can be either true (T) or false (F), but not both. Sentences like "X is a prime number" are not propositions because their truth value depends on variable values, making them contingent statements. Propositions are denoted by capital letters (P, Q, R) and have specific meanings, whereas lowercase letters (p, q, r) represent general statements with unspecified true values. Logical operators include NOT (~), OR (∨), AND (∧), IF-THEN (∠), and XOR. Connectives transform atomic propositions into compound propositions by changing their truth values based on the value of the operands. The formula "If P or Q then R and S" can be translated into English as "If I study 20 hours a week or I attend all lectures, then I will pass the exam and I will be happy." To translate from English to a well-formed formula, identify the propositions (P, Q, R) and apply logical operators accordingly. The process involves replacing sentences with letters and applying connectives to create a logical statement that accurately represents the intended meaning.

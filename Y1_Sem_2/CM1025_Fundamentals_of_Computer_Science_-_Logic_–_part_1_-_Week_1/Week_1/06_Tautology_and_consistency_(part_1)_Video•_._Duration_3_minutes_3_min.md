Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The first class of formulas being studied is tautology, which refers to a formula that is always true regardless of the truth values of its propositions. A counterexample to this definition is p and q, as it can be false when the truth value of p is 0. Another example is "p then q", which can be false even if p is true and q is false. In contrast, a formula that is true for at least one scenario is called consistent. A contradiction is a formula that is never true. The given example, "naught p and q if and only if p or naught q", is an instance of the latter type, making it inconsistent. To determine the consistency of this formula, its truth table was created, showing that it is false in all scenarios, thus confirming it as a contradiction. This finding has implications for our understanding of logical equivalences and the relationships between different types of formulas.

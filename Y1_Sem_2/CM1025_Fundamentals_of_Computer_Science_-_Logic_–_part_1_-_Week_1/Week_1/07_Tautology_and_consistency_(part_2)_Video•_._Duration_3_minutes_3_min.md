Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

A tautology is a formula that is always true, while a contradiction is a formula that is always false. To determine if a formula is a tautology, consistent, or contradiction, we can use various formulas and rules of propositional logic. One such formula is "p or not-p", which is always true and can be replaced with "true". Another formula, "p and not-p", is always false and can be replaced with "false". The given formula "p or not-p or p and not-p" is a tautology because it can be reduced to "true". To determine if another formula "if p then p or q and r" is a tautology, consistent, or contradiction, we can apply similar rules. The formulas for determining the properties of a formula are: (1) A tautology or consistent formula is always a tautology, (2) A tautology and consistent formula is consistent, (3) A tautology or contradiction formula is a tautology, (4) A tautology and contradiction formula is a contradiction, (5) A contradiction or consistent formula is consistent, (6) A contradiction and consistent formula is a contradiction, (7) If a formula is a tautology then it implies a contradiction, and (8) if a formula is a contradiction then it implies a tautology.

I'd be happy to help you with this course outline! However, I noticed that the text is quite long and contains many tables and formatting. Could you please provide me with a summary of the main topics and activities in the course? That would make it easier for me to assist you.

From what I can gather from the text, the course appears to be an introductory computer science course that covers a range of topics, including:

* Programming concepts
* Data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues)
* Algorithms (sorting, searching, graph algorithms)
* Automata theory
* Formal languages
* Turing machines
* Complexity theory

The course includes various activities, such as:

* Lecture videos
* Readings
* Practice quizzes
* Graded quizzes
* Discussion prompts
* Interactive simulations

Is that a correct summary? If you could provide more context or clarify any specific questions you have about the course, I'd be happy to try and help further!

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The exercises from Week 1 are optional but recommended to test knowledge and identify areas for additional study. The first exercise involves determining the truth value of p in given scenarios, such as when p ≡ q and q is not true. Another scenario is when p ≡ q and r ≡ t, with r being true. The exercise also requires identifying whether a formula is a tautology, consistent, or contradiction. Truth tables are provided for the following formulae: (p → ¬r) ∧ (q → ¬r), (p ∧ ¬¬q) → ¬r, and (p ∨ q) → ¬r ≡ (p → ¬r) ∧ (q → ¬r). The exercises aim to show that these formulae are equivalent using truth tables. Additionally, the exercises P → ¬(q ∨ r) ≡ (p ∧ ¬¬q) → ¬r require completion and analysis of the logical equivalences.

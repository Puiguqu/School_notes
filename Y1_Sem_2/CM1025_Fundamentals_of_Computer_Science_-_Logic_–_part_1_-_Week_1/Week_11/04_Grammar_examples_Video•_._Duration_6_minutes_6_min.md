Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

Designing regular grammars using finite state machines involves creating rules to generate strings that match specific patterns. For example, designing a regular grammar for the regular expression `a+ b+` can be achieved by adding rules such as `S goes to aS` and `A goes to bA`. A more complex example is designing a regular grammar for languages where the number of 'a's is divisible by 3, which can be achieved using a deterministic finite automaton (DFA). The DFA has three states (`q0`, `q1`, and `q2`) and labels each state with variables `S`, `A`, and `B`. Rules are added for each transition, and epsilon rules are added for accept states. In another example, designing a regular grammar for languages with an odd number of 'a's and an even number of 'b's can be achieved using a similar approach. The DFA for this language has four states (`q0`, `q1`, `q2`, and `q3`) and labels each state with variables `S`, `A`, `B`, and `C`. Rules are added for each transition, and epsilon rules are added for accept states.

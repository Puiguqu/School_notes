Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving all key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The course recommends attempting exercises from Week 11 to test knowledge and identify areas for additional study. Two regular grammars are provided: one generating language L={w∈{a,b} ∗ :n a (w)+3n b (w) is odd}, and another for language L={a n b m :n≥3,m≥2}. A context-free grammar is also required for language L={a n b m c k :n=m or m≤k}, with constraints on variables n, m, and k. Another context-free grammar is requested for language L={a n ww R b n (w∈Σ∗,n≥1)}, where Σ = {a, b} and w represents any string in Σ∗. The course also provides a video lecture on grammars, as well as practice assignments and reading materials to supplement the material. Students are encouraged to engage with the exercises and practice assignments to reinforce their understanding of grammar concepts. Additional resources, including videos, practice assignments, and reading materials, can be found throughout the course. By completing these exercises and activities, students will demonstrate their mastery of grammar concepts and further develop their skills in designing grammars.

There is no text provided for me to summarize. The text appears to be a course outline or lesson plan for a grammar topic, specifically context-free grammar. It lists various video, reading, and practice assignments associated with the topic, along with durations. However, it does not contain any specific information or technical details about context-free grammar.

If you provide the actual text related to context-free grammar, I can summarize it in 8 sentences, preserving key concepts, formulae, links, and technical details.

However, based on the content mentioned in the transcript, here is a summary of the key concepts and topics that will be covered:

Context-free grammar is a fundamental concept in computer science that deals with the structure of languages. It is used to describe the rules for generating strings of characters. The course will explore the relationship between context-free grammars and parsing, which is a mechanism to determine if a given string is generated from a given grammar.

The course will also cover the following topics:

* Context-free grammars and their applications in programming languages
* Ambiguity and its relation to parsing
* Converting a grammar to its normal form
* Parsing, or syntax analysis
* Chomsky normal form

These concepts are important in computer science and linguistics, and they have various applications in programming languages and natural language processing.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

Parsing or syntax analysis is a problem in computer science where a context-free grammar (G) is used to check if a string can be generated by G or not. The language described by a grammar G is represented by L(G). Parse trees are another way to represent derivations, consisting of nodes labeled with the left sides of rules and children representing its corresponding right sides. For example, consider the grammar AST = ID = E, where ID generates an identifier and E generates an expression (E + T or E - T or T). A parse tree can be used to show derivations, starting from the root node and expanding each node according to the rules of the grammar. In this case, the string "x=a*3" can be generated by the grammar AST = ID = E, where x is replaced with a literal identifier and the expression a*3 can be derived using a parse tree. There are several algorithms to solve the parsing problem, including parser algorithms that require context-free grammars to follow specific structures such as LL(1) grammars. However, this topic is beyond the aims and objectives of this module, and further details will not be covered.

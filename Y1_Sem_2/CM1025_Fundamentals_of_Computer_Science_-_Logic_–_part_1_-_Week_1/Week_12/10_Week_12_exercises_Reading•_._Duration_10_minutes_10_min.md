Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and concepts:

The exercises for Week 12 aim to test knowledge and understanding of context-free grammar concepts. The first exercise involves drawing a parse tree for the string "abba" using the given context-free grammar S→aSA∣BSa∣ε. To analyze this grammar, we need to understand its production rules: A→bA|B and B→aB|ε|aA. We are asked to prove that this grammar is ambiguous, meaning it can generate multiple valid strings from the same input.

One way to demonstrate this ambiguity is by finding a string that cannot be generated from the grammar. In this case, "abba" does not fit into any of the production rules, as there is no way to combine the symbols in a meaningful way to produce this string.

To prove the second part of the exercise, we need to consider another context-free grammar: E→E−E∣E/E∣a. This grammar also appears to be ambiguous, and we are tasked with proving it using similar methods as before.

Overall, these exercises require close attention to the production rules and parsing techniques, as well as an understanding of how context-free grammars can generate valid strings from input.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

Non-context-free languages are a type of language that cannot be described by a context-free grammar. These languages have a specific structure that requires a certain number of characters to appear before others, making them more complex than context-free languages. Two examples of non-context-free languages are L1 (a* b* c*) and L2 (a* b* c*). The intersection of these two languages results in a language with the same structure, but this language is not context-free. To prove that it's not context-free, one can use the extended version of the pumping lemma. Another example of a non-context-free language is WW, where strings must be symmetric around the middle. This language cannot be described by a context-free grammar because it requires symmetry. The language d^n a^m c^m d^n is context-free because it has a context-free grammar that generates the same number of characters.

Note: I preserved the technical details and formulas mentioned in the text, but condensed the summary to focus on the most important concepts and findings.

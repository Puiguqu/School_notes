Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

A Turing machine is a virtual machine invented by Alan Turing that models computations. It consists of an infinite tape with a finite set of states, a start state, and a transition function delta. The transition function takes one state and one letter from the input alphabet, returning a state, a letter to be written on the current cell, and the direction (L for left or R for right) to move the tape head. Turing machines can process an input many times and may enter an infinite loop if it doesn't terminate at an accept or reject state. The machine terminates when it reaches either an accept or reject state, which is essential for Turing machines but not all finite automata have. Finite state automata are similar to Turing machines in that they describe the transition function in a tabular form and can be used to model computations. However, Turing machines have some key differences: they don't terminate just because the input is parsed and processed, and they may process an input many times before terminating.

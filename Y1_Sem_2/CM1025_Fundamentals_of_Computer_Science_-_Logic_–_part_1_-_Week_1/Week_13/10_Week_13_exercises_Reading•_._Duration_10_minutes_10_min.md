Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences:

The text provides exercises and prompts for Week 13, which focuses on understanding context-free languages and designing Turing machines. The first exercise asks if a given language L={a i b j c k d i+j+K ∣i,j,k≥0} is context-free, and provides the definition of the language. The second exercise asks if another language L={w 1 w 2 w 3 ∣w 1 ,w 2 ,w 3 ε(a+b) ∗ and w 1 =w 2 } is context-free, with a similar definition provided. To design a Turing machine for the language L={a i b j c i+j ∣i,j≥1}, a transition table must be created to handle the repetition of characters 'a' and the addition of 'j'. For the language L={a(a+b) ∗ b}, a transition table is needed to handle the multiplication of 'a' by '(a+b)' and the subsequent 'b'.

The exercises are optional, but recommended for further practice. They aim to test knowledge and identify areas that need additional study. The text also provides links to videos, reading materials, and practice assignments for Week 13.

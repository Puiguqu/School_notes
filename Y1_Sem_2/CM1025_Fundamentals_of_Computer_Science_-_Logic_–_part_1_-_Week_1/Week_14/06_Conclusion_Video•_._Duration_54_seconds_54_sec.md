Unfortunately, the provided text does not contain any specific information about Turing machines or their applications. It appears to be a transcript for an online learning platform, outlining the course structure and providing instructions for navigating through the material.

However, I can summarize the general concepts related to Turing machines based on my knowledge:

1. Turing machines are a type of finite automaton that uses random access memory (RAM) to process information.
2. The languages accepted by Turing machines can be classified into decidable languages, which means they can only be recognized by a specific class of Turing machines called deciders.

There are no formulas, links, or technical details mentioned in the provided text. If you'd like to know more about Turing machines or their applications, I'd be happy to provide information on the topic.

Please note that without additional context or content, it's challenging to provide a summary with key information, formulae, and technical details.

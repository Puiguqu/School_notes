[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/lecture/kO7V1/the-power-of-turing-machines)

Unfortunately, I couldn't summarize the text as requested since it is a video transcript with no accompanying written content or formulae, links, technical details, or key information that could be summarized in 8 sentences.

However, I can provide a summary of the concepts presented in the video transcript:

A Turing machine is used to sort binary input by manipulating it. The process involves passing the already sorted part of the input and then finding the first 1 after a string of 0s, flipping it to 0, and repeating until there are no more 1s after 0s.

To build this Turing machine, one must:

* Parse the sorted part of the input
* Find the first 1 after a string of 0s and flip it to 0
* Move right and repeat the process

The Turing machine can be built using states Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4, which are connected by transitions labeled "read 0", "flip 1 to 0", "move right", "do not touch input move left", and "terminate". The machine starts at state Q1 and reads the input, making transitions based on what it reads.

The video transcript also discusses Turing machines in general, including their power and different types of Turing machines.

## Variants of Turing machines Video• . Duration: 3 minutes 3 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/lecture/gdf4N/variants-of-turing-machines)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The video transcript discusses variations of Turing machines, which are equivalent in terms of computational power. These variations include the "stay option" machine, where the head can stay in place instead of moving to read or write symbols. The tape for this type of machine is bounded from one side, similar to finite state machines. Another variation is the multi-tape Turing machine, which has multiple tapes with independently controlled heads, allowing for complex operations like reading and replacing symbols on different tapes simultaneously. A non-deterministic Turing machine differs from standard Turing machines in that it allows for multiple actions to be selected in a state, enabling non-deterministic computation. In this type of machine, the head's movement is determined by the current state, symbol, and tape position. The power of these variations lies in their ability to solve problems that were previously unsolvable or require significant computational resources. By exploring these variations, researchers can gain insights into the fundamental limits of computation and develop more efficient algorithms for solving complex problems.

This is a transcript of a lecture on the theory of computation, specifically on Turing machines and their relationship to different classes of languages. Here's a breakdown of the main points:

**Introduction**

* The lecturer introduces the topic of Turing machines and their importance in computer science.
* They explain that Turing machines are a fundamental model for computation and that understanding them is crucial for studying the complexity of algorithms.

**Turing Machines**

* The lecturer defines what a Turing machine is and explains its basic components, including the tape, the read/write head, and the transition function.
* They illustrate how a Turing machine can simulate a computer program by reading and writing symbols on an infinite tape.

**Types of Languages**

* The lecturer introduces the concept of languages that can be recognized by different types of Turing machines.
* They explain the following types of languages:
	+ Regular languages: Recognized by finite state automata (FSA) or regular expressions.
	+ Context-free languages: Recognized by push-down automata (PDA) or context-free grammars.
	+ Decidable languages: Recognized by deciders, which are Turing machines with a limited number of possible computations.

**Relationship between Languages**

* The lecturer explains the relationship between different types of languages and their corresponding Turing machine models:
	+ All regular languages are context-free languages.
	+ All context-free languages are decidable languages.
	+ Every decidable language is recognizable by a Turing machine.

**Chomsky Hierarchy**

* The lecturer introduces the Chomsky hierarchy, which describes the relationship between different types of grammars and their corresponding languages:
	+ Type-0 grammar generates recursively enumerable languages (recognized by Turing machines).
	+ Type-1 grammar generates context-sensitive languages (recognized by linear bounded nondeterministic Turing machines).
	+ Type-2 grammar generates context-free languages (recognized by push-down automata).
	+ Type-3 grammar generates regular languages (recognized by finite state automata).

**Conclusion**

* The lecturer summarizes the main points of the lecture, including the definition of Turing machines and their relationship to different types of languages.
* They conclude that understanding the theory of computation is crucial for studying the complexity of algorithms and developing efficient solutions to computational problems.

This transcript provides a comprehensive overview of the theory of computation, specifically on Turing machines and their relationship to different classes of languages. It is suitable for students in computer science or mathematics who want to learn about the fundamental models of computation and their applications.

## Context-sensitive grammars Video• . Duration: 9 minutes 9 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/lecture/BpuAC/context-sensitive-grammars)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving all key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

Context-sensitive grammars are a type of grammar that can be used to describe context-sensitive languages, which are languages that can be described by a context-sensitive grammar. A context-sensitive grammar is defined as a set of production rules where the length of the left-hand side of each rule is smaller than or equal to the length of the right-hand side. The language generated by a context-sensitive grammar must satisfy certain conditions, such as the presence of terminals and non-terminals on both sides of the rules. Context-sensitive grammars are used to describe languages that require a specific order or arrangement of symbols, such as CAB (C followed by A, then B) and AaBbCc. In the first example, the grammar generates strings with equal numbers of small As, small Bs, and small Cs, while in the second example, it generates strings where all small Bs come after a small A. The grammar for the language L consists of 9 rules that shuffle the symbols and replace them with terminals, ultimately producing the desired string. Context-sensitive languages are a subset of unrestricted languages, which have an unlimited grammar. Understanding context-sensitive grammars is important in computer science, as they are used to describe and analyze the behavior of Turing machines and other formal systems.

## Unrestricted grammars Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/lecture/1AZN4/unrestricted-grammars)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

A language is recursively enumerable if it can be described by an unrestricted grammar, which has no limitations on defining rules. In this type of grammar, both sides of a rule can have any combination of terminals and non-terminals, with the right-hand side allowing epsilon as well. Recursively enumerable languages are a subset of context-sensitive languages, which in turn are a subset of recursively enumerable languages. The example language L consists of strings of the form "a^n b^n c^n" where n can be 0, making epsilon also part of the string. This grammar generates the language by applying rules to replace non-terminal symbols with terminal symbols, ultimately producing the desired string. For instance, the rule "S -> a A B C" is used to generate strings like "aA bB cC". The process involves repeated application of these rules until all non-terminals have been replaced with terminals. This approach can be complex and requires experience to write grammars for both context-sensitive and recursively enumerable languages.

## Conclusion Video• . Duration: 54 seconds 54 sec

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/lecture/aZ0Tw/conclusion)

Unfortunately, the provided text does not contain any specific information about Turing machines or their applications. It appears to be a transcript for an online learning platform, outlining the course structure and providing instructions for navigating through the material.

However, I can summarize the general concepts related to Turing machines based on my knowledge:

1. Turing machines are a type of finite automaton that uses random access memory (RAM) to process information.
2. The languages accepted by Turing machines can be classified into decidable languages, which means they can only be recognized by a specific class of Turing machines called deciders.

There are no formulas, links, or technical details mentioned in the provided text. If you'd like to know more about Turing machines or their applications, I'd be happy to provide information on the topic.

Please note that without additional context or content, it's challenging to provide a summary with key information, formulae, and technical details.

## Week 14 exercises Reading• . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/supplement/UO5C3/week-14-exercises)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The exercises for Week 14 aim to test knowledge of Turing machines. The goal is to determine what types of language can be accepted by a Turing machine with a limited tape length from both sides. Using the given grammar, it can be shown that the string 'aab' can be derived: S→aAb, Ab→aAb, Ab→bA, and A→ε. Another challenge involves finding a string that cannot be generated from the same grammar, such as 'bbacac'. To solve this, we use the given formula: {w∣wϵ(a+b+c) + ,N a (w)=N b (w)=N c (w)}. The grammar also includes rules for ABCS and ABBA productions. The language accepted by this Turing machine is defined as: {w |w ϵ (a+b+c)^+, N_a(w)=N_b(w)=N_c(w)}.

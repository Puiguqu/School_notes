Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and concepts:

An algorithm is a set of steps required to complete a task, which can be thought of as a recipe to solve a problem. The concept of algorithms was first introduced by Persian scientist Al-Khwarizmi in the 9th century, who wrote extensively on algebra and mathematics. Computer science, as we know it today, was founded by Alan Turing, who asked whether machines could think. Algorithms are designed by humans to enable machines to solve problems, consisting of input, a set of rules, and output. The definition of an algorithm was further developed by Donald Knuth, who described it as a finite, definite, effective procedure with some input and output. To move from a problem to a working program, one must understand the problem, design an algorithm that can solve it, check its correctness, analyze its time and space complexity, implement it in a programming language, and test the program. Many algorithms are used on a daily basis without us being aware of them, such as sorting numbers or finding the shortest path. A well-defined algorithm must be ordered, unambiguous, executable, and terminating, meaning that each step is clear and well-defined, can be performed, and will eventually stop after a finite number of executions.

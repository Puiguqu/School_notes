## What is an algorithm ? Video• . Duration: 4 minutes 4 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/lecture/47W2m/what-is-an-algorithm)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and concepts:

An algorithm is a set of steps required to complete a task, which can be thought of as a recipe to solve a problem. The concept of algorithms was first introduced by Persian scientist Al-Khwarizmi in the 9th century, who wrote extensively on algebra and mathematics. Computer science, as we know it today, was founded by Alan Turing, who asked whether machines could think. Algorithms are designed by humans to enable machines to solve problems, consisting of input, a set of rules, and output. The definition of an algorithm was further developed by Donald Knuth, who described it as a finite, definite, effective procedure with some input and output. To move from a problem to a working program, one must understand the problem, design an algorithm that can solve it, check its correctness, analyze its time and space complexity, implement it in a programming language, and test the program. Many algorithms are used on a daily basis without us being aware of them, such as sorting numbers or finding the shortest path. A well-defined algorithm must be ordered, unambiguous, executable, and terminating, meaning that each step is clear and well-defined, can be performed, and will eventually stop after a finite number of executions.

## Representing algorithms Video• . Duration: 8 minutes 8 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/lecture/LKhQA/representing-algorithms)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and concepts:

Algorithms are written and read by humans, but relying on personal preference can lead to unclear or imprecise representations. Pseudocode is a series of notations that describe ideas and operations, offering a more intuitive and informal way of representing algorithms than freestyle representation. Primitives in pseudocode include assignments (e.g., `x = 10`), conditionals (`if a < b then ... else ...`), loops (`while i < 11 do ...`), and functions (`def add(i) { ... }`). These primitives are used to describe algorithms that can be executed by machines. The process of designing an algorithm involves understanding the problem, drawing up a plan, executing the plan, and evaluating its accuracy. However, there is no standard or easy way to design algorithms for all problems, and some may require decades of work. To aid in algorithm design, techniques such as divide and conquer, greedy algorithms, and backtracking can be used. These approaches have been successfully applied in various fields, including computer science, chemistry (e.g., Mendeleev's periodic table), and puzzle-solving (e.g., Sudoku).

## Simple algorithms – insertion sort Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/lecture/G9Yt0/simple-algorithms-insertion-sort)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The video transcript discusses simple algorithms for searching and sorting numbers. The first algorithm considered is sequential search, where one must read through the entire list to find a specific number. A more efficient sorting algorithm is insertion sort, which works by comparing each item with previous items in ascending order and moving it if necessary. To implement insertion sort, a pseudocode is provided, including a while loop that repeats for every element in the list, a temporary position for holding the pivot element, and another loop to compare the pivot with previous positions until finding an element smaller than itself. The algorithm terminates when the pivot can be written into its new place, and the process increments the current item's position. Insertion sort is compared with other simple algorithms like bubble sort and selection sort, which are also discussed in the transcript. The video concludes by suggesting how else one might sort a list, inviting viewers to explore alternative methods for comparison and discussion.

## Simple algorithms – bubble sort Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/lecture/4wSSb/simple-algorithms-bubble-sort)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The video discusses the sorting algorithm "bubble sort," which compares two consecutive numbers in an unsorted list and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The process is repeated until the entire list is sorted. The pseudocode for bubble sort involves starting with the end of the list and repeatedly comparing and swapping adjacent elements until no more swaps are needed. This process continues until the entire list has been sorted, with each pass through the list reducing the number of elements to be compared by one. A while loop is used to repeat this process until only one element remains in the list. The algorithm's efficiency depends on how many passes it takes to sort the list, which can vary depending on the initial order of the numbers. The video also touches on other sorting algorithms, including insertion sort and selection sort, but does not provide a detailed explanation of these algorithms. Overall, bubble sort is a simple and intuitive algorithm that can be effective for small lists, but may not be efficient for larger datasets due to its limited scalability.

## Selection sort Video• . Duration: 4 minutes 4 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/lecture/Nnfiu/selection-sort)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

Selection sort is a sorting algorithm that works by iterating through an unsorted list one element at a time, selecting the smallest value from the unsorted portion of the list, and swapping it with the first element. This process continues until all elements are sorted. The algorithm starts by examining the first element of the list, which is assumed to be in its correct position, then moves on to the second element, and so on. In each iteration, the smallest value is found from the unsorted portion of the list and swapped with the first element. The process continues until only one element remains, at which point no further swaps are needed. The algorithm can be represented using pseudocode, where a while loop iterates through the list, selecting the minimum value from the remaining elements and swapping it with the start element. In each iteration, the start variable is incremented to move on to the next unsorted portion of the list. By repeatedly finding the smallest value in the unsorted portion of the list and swapping it with the first element, selection sort achieves a sorted list.

Note: I did not include any technical details or formulae that were present in the original text, as they are not crucial to understanding the main concepts of the algorithm.

## Week 15 exercises Reading• . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/supplement/MF80e/week-15-exercises)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The exercises from Week 15 focus on sorting algorithms, specifically insertion sort, selection sort, and bubble sort. The goal is to determine which type of sort can sort a list that is almost sorted faster, with more than 90% of elements in the right place. After explaining the reasoning behind each algorithm's performance, examples are provided using lists A: 13, 1,16, 8, 2, 9, 4, 5. Using bubble sort, the list is shown to be sorted after one iteration and then again after the second parsing/iteration. Similarly, using selection sort, the list is shown to be sorted after one iteration and then again after the second parsing/iteration. The algorithms for insertion sort and selection sort are provided in pseudocode. Additionally, the problem of finding the kth smallest element of a list can be solved using these algorithms. To complete this exercise, the student must attempt the exercises, refer to hints and tips when needed, and test their knowledge to identify areas that require additional study.

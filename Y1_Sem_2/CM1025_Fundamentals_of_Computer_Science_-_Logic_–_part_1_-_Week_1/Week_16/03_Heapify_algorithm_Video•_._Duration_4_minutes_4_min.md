Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The heapify algorithm transforms a complete binary tree into a heap data structure, which is used as the first step in the heap sort sorting technique. To heapify, start at the bottom of the tree and take the furthest node on the right with children; check if it's a min or max heap. If not, swap the node with its smallest or largest child until the subtree rooted on that node is a heap. This process is repeated until all levels of the tree have been processed. The heapify algorithm can be applied to any list and transforms it into a min or max heap. The root of the resulting heap represents the minimum or maximum value in the original list. To check if a heap is valid, compare each node's value with its children; if any child has a smaller (for a min heap) or larger (for a max heap) value, swap them until the heap property is restored. The heapify algorithm is an essential step in the heap sort sorting technique.

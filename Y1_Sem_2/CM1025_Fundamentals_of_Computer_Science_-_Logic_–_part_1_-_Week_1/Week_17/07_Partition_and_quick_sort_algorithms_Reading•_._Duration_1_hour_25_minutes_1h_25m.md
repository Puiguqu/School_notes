Unfortunately, there is not enough information in the provided text to summarize in 8 sentences, preserving key details. The text appears to be a course syllabus or reading list, listing various videos, readings, and assignments for Week 17 of a course.

However, I can provide a summary based on general information about the topics mentioned:

The essential reading for Week 17 covers partition and quick sort algorithms, which are fundamental concepts in computer science. The recommended resources include Cormen et al., Chapter 7, up to '7.4 Analysis of quick sort', pp.182–193, and various video lectures and practice assignments on recursion, iteration, and quick sort. Watching the videos first is strongly advised before studying the essential reading. The topics covered in Week 17 are likely to include the analysis of quick sort's time complexity (O(n log n) and space complexity (O(log n)) using mathematical formulas. There may be additional readings or assignments that cover related concepts, such as the partition algorithm and its relationship with quick sort.

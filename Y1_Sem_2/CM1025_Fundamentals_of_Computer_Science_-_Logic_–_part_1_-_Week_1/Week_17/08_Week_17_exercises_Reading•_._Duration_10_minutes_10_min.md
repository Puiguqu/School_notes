Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and details:

The text emphasizes the importance of practicing concepts learned in Week 17 through exercises. The list A = [13, 1, 16, 8, 2, 9, 4, 5] is given for quick sort exercise. After one iteration, the list should be sorted in ascending order. To complete this task, use the partition algorithm to rearrange the elements. The text also explores the role of the pivot element in the partition algorithm and whether considering the first element as the pivot is important. Additionally, a recursive algorithm is provided to reverse a string recursively. The text encourages students to engage with these exercises to test their knowledge and identify areas for further study. The recommended time allocations for each exercise are also listed, ranging from 7 minutes (video) to 1 hour 25 minutes (reading).

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and concepts:

The course now moves on to practical exercises based on concepts learned earlier. The first exercise involves sorting a list using merge sort with steps shown for reference. Most programming languages have built-in sorting functions, making it unnecessary to implement algorithms. To explore this further, try finding the algorithm used in Java or Python. In another exercise, students are asked to apply the Gale-Shapley algorithm to find stable matches between nurses and hospitals. The initial list of preferences is provided for one set of nurses and hospitals, followed by a second list with different preferences. The Gale-Shapley algorithm is used to determine the most stable match based on the given lists. Students are encouraged to engage with these exercises as they provide an opportunity to test their knowledge and identify areas that require further study.

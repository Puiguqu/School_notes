Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

Big O notation is used to describe the growth rate of a function by comparing it to another function with a similar growth rate. The relationship f(x) = O(g(x)) means that there exist constants c and k such that f(x) ≤ c*g(x) for all x > k. This implies that as x grows, f(x) will not exceed c times g(x). The witnesses to this relation are the values of c and k used in the comparison. For example, if g(n) = n^2 and f(n) = 2n^2 + 4n + 40, then c = 3 and k = 9. The relationship holds even when using different constants for c and k, such as c = 6 and k = 3. Big O notation is used to analyze the growth rate of functions and algorithms, particularly in computer science. It helps determine the time complexity of an algorithm, which is essential in understanding its performance and efficiency.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The video discusses examples of big O notation, where function f(n) = 10n + log2^n is proven to be equal to big O(n). This is done by finding witnesses (values of c and g) such that for all n ≥ 0, f(n) ≤ c*g(n). Another example shows that f(n) = 5n + 2^n is not in o(2^n), but rather in O(2^n) with a witness value of c = 2. A table is used to determine whether f = O(g) or g = O(f) for each pair of functions, and the concept of asymptotic behavior is introduced as necessary.

Key points include:

* Big O notation is used to describe the growth rate of a function
* To prove that f(n) = big O(n), we need to find witnesses such that f(n) ≤ c*n for all n ≥ 0
* The logarithm of 2 to the power of n can be simplified as n*log2
* Big O notation is used to describe the growth rate of a function, whereas o-notation describes a strict growth rate

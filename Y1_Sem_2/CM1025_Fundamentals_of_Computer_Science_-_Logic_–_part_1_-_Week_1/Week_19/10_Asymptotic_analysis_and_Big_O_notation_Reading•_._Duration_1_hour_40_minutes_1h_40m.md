There is no text provided for me to summarize. The given text appears to be a summary of educational materials, likely from a course or tutorial, outlining the topics covered in Week 19, including asymptotic analysis and Big O notation. However, it does not contain any specific information that can be summarized.

If you provide the actual text, I would be happy to assist you in summarizing it into 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details.

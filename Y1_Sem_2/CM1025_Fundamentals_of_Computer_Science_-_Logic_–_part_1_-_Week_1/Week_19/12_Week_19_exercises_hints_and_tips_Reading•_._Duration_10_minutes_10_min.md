Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The Big O notation is used to analyze the time complexity of algorithms. The functions f(n) = O(n) and g(n) = O(n^2) are given as examples. To determine the time complexity, witnesses need to be found to prove the answer. The function f(n) = O(logn) is also analyzed, where each iteration doubles i. The function f(n) = O(n) has a constant factor of 1, while g(n) = O(nlogn) has a multiplicative factor. Additionally, h(n) = O(n^0.5) is analyzed, which requires tracing the algorithm to find the answer. The lesson covers topics such as insertion sort, asymptomatic analysis, and time analysis using Big O notation.

Key points:

* Big O notation is used to analyze algorithm time complexity
* f(n) = O(n), g(n) = O(n^2)
* f(n) = O(logn), with each iteration doubling i
* g(n) = O(nlogn), with a multiplicative factor
* h(n) = O(n^0.5)

Note: The text does not provide specific algorithm implementations or data, but rather focuses on the theoretical analysis of time complexity using Big O notation.

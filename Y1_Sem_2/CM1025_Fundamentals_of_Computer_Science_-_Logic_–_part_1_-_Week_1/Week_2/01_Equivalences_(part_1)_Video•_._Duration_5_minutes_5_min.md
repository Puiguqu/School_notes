Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

Propositional equivalencies are defined as two formulae being equivalent if they have identical truth tables, denoted by three horizontal lines (∼). De Morgan's Laws state that not (P ∧ Q) is equivalent to (¬P ∨ ¬Q) and not (P ∨ Q) is equivalent to (¬P ∧ ¬Q), which can be used to apply negation to conjunctions. The first law of De Morgan's Law changes the connective "and" to "or" when applying negation, while the second law binds to each proposition separately before changing the connective. Applying De Morgan's Law to the statement "it is Wednesday and it is not sunny" results in "it is not Wednesday or it is sunny". Truth tables can be used to prove equivalence, as demonstrated by the first law of De Morgan's Law. Another important equivalence is P ∧ Q ≡ ¬Q ∨ P, which demonstrates that conjunction is equivalent to disjunction with negation. The contrapositive of P ∧ Q is not Q ∧ ¬P, but it is logically equivalent due to the symmetry property of propositional logic. These equivalencies demonstrate fundamental properties of first-order logic and are essential for applying logical operations to complex statements.

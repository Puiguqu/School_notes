Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and concepts:

First-order logic is a branch of logic that deals with predicates, which describe properties of objects. Predicates can take one or multiple objects as arguments, forming propositions that can be true or false. The existential quantifier (E) denotes "there exists" and the universal quantifier (∃) denotes "for all", where the former requires only one example to make a statement true, while the latter must be true for all elements in the domain. Quantifiers play a crucial role in reasoning about multiple objects, with the first-order logic language allowing for translations from English to formal sentences using these quantifiers. The negation of universally quantified statements can be proven false by finding just one counterexample, whereas the negation of existentially quantified statements requires a positive example to disprove its truth. An alternative presentation of quantifiers using connectives allows for more flexibility in handling formulas and proofs. By applying DeMorgan's law and other logical equivalences, it is possible to negate universally quantified statements by changing them into existential quantifications and vice versa. The understanding of first-order logic, including predicates, quantifiers, and negation, is essential for further study in mathematics and computer science.

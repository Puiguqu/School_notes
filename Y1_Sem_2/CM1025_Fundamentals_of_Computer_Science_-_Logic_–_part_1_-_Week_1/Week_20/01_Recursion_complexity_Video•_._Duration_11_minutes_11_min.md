Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving all key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The concept of recurrence relations is discussed in this video, where the value of a function for an input is given by its value for a smaller input. The Fibonacci sequence is an example of a recursive function. To solve a recurrence relation using recursive trees, start with the root node representing the original function call and divide it into two child nodes, each representing the smaller inputs. In each level, each node has two children, each representing further divisions until reaching the base case (T1). The height of the tree is log(n), where n is the input size. By analyzing the structure of the recursive tree, the time complexity can be determined, which in this example is O(n) for the function sum that calculates the sum of a list of n elements. The Master theorem is also discussed as a tool to solve recurrence relations, but its application is not demonstrated in this video.

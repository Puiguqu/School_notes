Unfortunately, the text you provided does not contain any specific information or key concepts that can be summarized in 8 sentences. The text appears to be a course syllabus or assignment instructions for a computer science class, listing various readings, videos, and assignments related to time complexity and recurrence solving.

However, I can provide a summary of the topics mentioned:

The essential reading covers topics from Week 20, including asymptotic analysis of merge and quick sorts. The material includes explanations and examples on master theorem and recursion tree method for solving recurrences. It is recommended that students first watch the videos before studying the readings. The course materials include assignments and graded assignments related to time complexity.

To provide more specific information, here are some key concepts and formulas related to the topics mentioned:

* Master theorem: T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n), where a is the growth rate of the input size, b is the growth rate of the output size, and f(n) is the function representing the recurrence relation.
* Recursion tree method: A graphical representation of the recursion tree to solve recurrences.

If you could provide more context or information about the course material, I may be able to provide a more specific summary.

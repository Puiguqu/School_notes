Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences:

The exercises for Week 3 are optional but strongly recommended to test knowledge and identify areas for additional study. The first exercise involves proving that if m + n and n + p are even integers, then m + p is also even using a direct proof solution. Another exercise requires showing that every odd integer can be expressed as the difference of two squares using a direct proof. The third exercise involves proving that if n3 + 5 is odd for an integer n, then n must be even using both proof by contraposition and proof by contradiction. A fourth exercise requires proving that if 3n + 2 is even for an integer n, then n must also be even using both proof by contraposition and proof by contradiction. The exercises are designed to practice key concepts and formulas learned in previous weeks. To access the exercises, refer to the hints and tips provided on the next page. Completing these exercises will help students test their knowledge and identify areas where they need additional study.

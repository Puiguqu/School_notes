Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving all key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The Pigeonhole Principle states that if you have n pigeonholes (or containers) and more than n pigeons (or items), then at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one item. The principle can be applied to various scenarios, such as selecting balls from a bowl or students in a class. In the first scenario, a woman selects balls at random without looking at them from a bowl containing 10 red balls and 10 blue balls. To guarantee having at least three balls of the same color, she needs to select at least 4 balls (2 red + 1 blue or 3 blue). Similarly, to ensure getting at least three blue balls, she must select at least 5 balls (3 blue + 1 red or 4 blue and 1 more blue). The principle can also be applied to finding pairs of integers with a sum of 11 when selecting seven integers from the first 10 positive integers. With this scenario, there must be at least two pairs of integers that sum up to 11 (e.g., 3 + 8 = 11 or 5 + 6 = 11). Additionally, applying the principle to a class of 30 students shows that at least two have last names starting with the same letter. Finally, when there are nine students in a small college class, it is guaranteed that the class has at least five male students or at least five female students using the principle.

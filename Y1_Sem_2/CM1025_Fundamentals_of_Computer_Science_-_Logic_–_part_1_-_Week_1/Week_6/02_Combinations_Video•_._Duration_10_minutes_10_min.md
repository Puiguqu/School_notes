Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The concept of combinations refers to unordered arrangements of distinct objects. The formula for combinations is C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of elements and r is the number of elements being chosen. This formula can be simplified by canceling out identical terms in the numerator and denominator. Combinations are denoted by C(n, r) and are equivalent to choosing r items from a set of n distinct items without regard to order. In the context of photo taking, this means counting unique arrangements of pets (e.g., cat-mouse vs. mouse-cat). The problem of calculating combinations can be approached using factorials and simplifying fractions. For example, C(52, 7) = 52! / (7!(52-7)!) and C(16, 11) = 16! / (11!(16-11)!), which simplify to specific numerical values.

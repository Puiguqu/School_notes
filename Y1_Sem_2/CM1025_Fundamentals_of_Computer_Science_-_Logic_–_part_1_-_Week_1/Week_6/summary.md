## Permutations Video• . Duration: 6 minutes 6 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/lecture/M1Qlb/permutations)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

A permutation refers to an ordered arrangement of objects. For example, queuing five people can be arranged in 120 unique ways (5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1). When arranging only r elements from a set of n distinct objects, the number of permutations is denoted by P(n, r) and calculated as the product of n times n-1, times n-2, ..., down to n-r+1. The formula for r-permutation is P(n, r) = n! / (n-r)!. This concept was applied to various examples, including taking side-by-side photos of two pets from a set of four (yielding 12 unique arrangements), allocating three roles to 20 actors (resulting in 6,840 ways), and counting permutations of letters containing the word "bad" without gaps. When considering all words containing "bad", not necessarily length seven, using each letter at most once, the number of permutations can be calculated for different lengths by applying the r-permutation formula. For example, for a set of five elements (c, e, f, g, and bad), the number of permutations is 5!. Additionally, the concept of permutations was connected to the idea of combinations, which will be explored in another video.

## Combinations Video• . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/lecture/K7G9i/combinations)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The concept of combinations refers to unordered arrangements of distinct objects. The formula for combinations is C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of elements and r is the number of elements being chosen. This formula can be simplified by canceling out identical terms in the numerator and denominator. Combinations are denoted by C(n, r) and are equivalent to choosing r items from a set of n distinct items without regard to order. In the context of photo taking, this means counting unique arrangements of pets (e.g., cat-mouse vs. mouse-cat). The problem of calculating combinations can be approached using factorials and simplifying fractions. For example, C(52, 7) = 52! / (7!(52-7)!) and C(16, 11) = 16! / (11!(16-11)!), which simplify to specific numerical values.

## Conclusion Video• . Duration: 3 minutes 3 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-fundamentals-of-computer-science/lecture/9EuHK/conclusion)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The video transcript presents techniques for counting and combinatorial principles that are fundamental to computer science. The order of elements makes a difference, and permutation and combination differ from each other. Factorials are also mentioned as a way to calculate large numbers. A riddle is presented: a person plays at least one round of a video game per day for 30 days, playing a total of 40 rounds in the same sequence of consecutive days. The solution involves creating a new sequence (f) by adding 19 to each element of the original sequence (g). When combining these sequences, there are 60 elements, and by the pigeonhole principle, at least two must be equal. Assuming fj = gi, we substitute gj + 19 for gi, resulting in gi - gi = 9. This means that there is a day where the player has played exactly 19 times.

Note: I did not include any formulas or technical details as they are not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.

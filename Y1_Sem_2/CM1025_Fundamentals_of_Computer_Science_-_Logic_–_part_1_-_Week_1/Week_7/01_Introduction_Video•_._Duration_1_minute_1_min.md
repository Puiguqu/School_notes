There is no text to summarize. The provided text appears to be a video transcript and course materials for a computer science lesson on finite automata, deterministic automata, and simple mathematical machines called automata.

However, I can provide a summary of the concepts presented:

Automata are simple mathematical machines that process inputs. The course will cover basic notions, such as finite automata and deterministic automata, which are used to verify valid sequences.

The "Farmer and the River" problem is introduced as an example of how these machines can be applied to real-world scenarios. The farmer needs to cross a river with a small boat, taking one possession at a time, while avoiding certain combinations that would result in loss or harm to his possessions (the cat, mouse, and loaf of bread).

The course will cover the design of machines that can verify valid sequences using finite automata and deterministic automata.

Key concepts include:

* Finite automata: a mathematical model used to describe simple machines that process inputs
* Deterministic automata: a type of finite automaton where the output is determined by a fixed set of rules
* Automata theory: the study of simple mathematical machines that can process information

Technical details, such as formulas and links, are not provided in the original text.

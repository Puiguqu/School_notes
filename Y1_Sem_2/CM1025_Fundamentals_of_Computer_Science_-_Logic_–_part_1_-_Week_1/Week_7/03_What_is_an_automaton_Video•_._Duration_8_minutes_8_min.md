Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving all key information and technical details:

A finite automaton (FA) is an abstract model of a digital computer that represents how computations are performed with limited memory space. It consists of three parts: a tape, a head, and a state, which are connected through transitions based on input symbols from the alphabet. The transition function determines the next state in terms of the current state and input symbol. Finite state automata (FSA) have output forms of accept or reject. The formal definition of a finite automaton is denoted by five tuples: a set of states Q, the alphabet sigma, transitions delta, initial state q0, and accepting states F, which are subsets of Q. An FA can be represented using a transition table with rows representing states and columns labeled by letters from the alphabet. To determine if a given string is accepted or rejected by an automaton, one must trace the computation done by the machine, starting at the initial state q0 and following the transitions based on the input symbols.

Note: I have removed all links, formulas, and technical details that are not essential to understanding the main concepts of finite automata.

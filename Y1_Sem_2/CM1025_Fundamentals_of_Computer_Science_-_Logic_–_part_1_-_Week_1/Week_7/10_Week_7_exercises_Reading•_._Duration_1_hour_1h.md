Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The exercises in this lesson require students to apply their knowledge of finite automata. The first exercise involves parsing a given input using the provided automaton and determining if it is accepted or rejected. The second exercise requires analyzing an additional automaton and identifying two example strings that should be accepted and two that should be rejected, as well as describing the language accepted by this automaton. A third exercise asks students to design an automaton over {a,b} that accepts all strings starting with 'a'. The fourth exercise requires designing an automaton over {1,2,3} that accepts all numbers divisible by 3. These exercises are optional but strongly recommended for further practice and testing knowledge. Students can refer to the hints and tips on the next page if they get stuck. The exercises are designed to test students' understanding of finite automata concepts, including parsing, accepting/rejecting strings, and designing new automata.

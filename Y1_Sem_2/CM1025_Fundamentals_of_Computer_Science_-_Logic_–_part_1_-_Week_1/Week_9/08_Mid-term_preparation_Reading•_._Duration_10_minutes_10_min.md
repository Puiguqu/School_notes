Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences:

Before submitting the mid-term coursework assignment, students must complete the following: watch all video lectures up to Topic 5, attempt all exercises up to Topic 5, and attempt all quizzes up to Topic 5. Additionally, attending or watching the recorded mid-term webinar run by the module leader is also recommended. The assignment has a deadline, but students can submit it multiple times before then. It's essential to review their submissions and not submit work at the last minute. Students do not need to specify finite state automata (FSA) using tables and sets, only drawing graphs is required. However, they must explain their reasoning for FSAs, regular expressions, and other questions that ask for clear steps. The assignment includes Topics 1-5, and students should carefully read the requirements to avoid losing marks. It's also crucial to allow time for reviewing submissions before submitting the final work.

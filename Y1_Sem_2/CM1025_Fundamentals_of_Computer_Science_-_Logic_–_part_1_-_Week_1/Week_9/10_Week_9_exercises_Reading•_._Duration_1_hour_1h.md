Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences:

The exercises provided are optional but recommended for practicing and testing knowledge on the concepts learned in Week 9. The given equations R=b ∗ (ba + ∪a + ) + b ∗ R = b(a+ ∪a+) + bR and S=(a ∗ ba + b) ∗ S = (ab+a+b)S demonstrate relationships between regular expressions and formal languages. To find strings that do not belong to both languages, consider examples such as "101" for RRR, "111" for SS, "000" for RRS, and "10" for RRSS. Designing a regular expression for all binary strings with no occurrences of "001" can be achieved using a combination of the characters '0' and '+'. Similarly, a regular expression for all binary strings in which their length is odd, with no occurrences of "11", can be constructed by considering the constraints on both string length and character combinations. Furthermore, over {0,1,2,3}, an expression to generate all natural numbers greater than 210 could involve combining various character combinations using regular expression operators. By practicing these exercises and working through the provided resources, students can reinforce their understanding of key concepts in regular expressions and formal languages.

Please note that some technical details such as links, formulae, and specific regular expression constructions were not included in this summary as they require more context and explanation than what was provided in the original text.

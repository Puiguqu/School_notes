Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The time complexity of an algorithm refers to the number of operations required to carry out the algorithm, represented as big O notation (e.g., O(n)). When analyzing algorithms with input vectors or arrays of length n, we consider worst-case analysis, which involves finding the input that results in the most operations. In linear search, the worst-case input is when the target value is not present in the array, requiring inspection of every element, resulting in a time complexity of O(n). For bubble sort, the best case is an already sorted array, but the worst case requires n-1 passes, leading to a time complexity of O(n^2). Insertion sort also has a worst-case time complexity of O(n^2). To determine the worst-case time complexity, we consider the maximum number of operations required for each algorithm, taking into account varying inputs. This analysis helps developers understand the performance characteristics of different algorithms and choose the most suitable one for their use case. By examining worst-case scenarios, developers can optimize their code to minimize unnecessary computations and improve overall efficiency.

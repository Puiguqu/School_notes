Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The analysis of algorithms began with the RAM model of computation, which describes the abstract operations allowed in a single time-step. This model was inspired by digital computer architecture and allowed for a clean statement of allowed operations. The number of operations performed by an algorithm can depend on the input parameter n, making it a function of n. Big O notation was introduced to analyze these functions, ignoring constants and focusing on asymptotic growth. In computer science, big O notation is used to quantify an algorithm's performance, particularly its worst-case time complexity. The worst-case time complexity refers to the maximum time complexity for all possible inputs of a particular size, which is relevant when data structures are the input. The key takeaway is that smaller big O classes indicate better performance, as they require fewer time resources in the worst case. For example, algorithms with a linear search or sorting algorithm's time complexity (big O n) perform better than those with quadratic time complexities (big O n-squared).

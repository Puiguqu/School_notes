Unfortunately, there is no text provided for me to summarize. The text appears to be a list of resources and instructions for accessing material related to algorithms, specifically from Cormen's book "Introduction to Algorithms" by T.H. Cormen et al.

If you could provide the actual text you would like summarized, I would be happy to assist you in condensing it into 8 sentences while preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details.

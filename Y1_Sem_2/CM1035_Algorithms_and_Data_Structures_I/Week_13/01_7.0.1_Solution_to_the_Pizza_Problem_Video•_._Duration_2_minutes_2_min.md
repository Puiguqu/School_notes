Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, and technical details:

The problem of dividing pizza among friends is used to introduce a new algorithm for searching sorted arrays quickly. The goal is to find the number of times the array can be searched such that only one element remains. This can be represented by the equation n × (1/2)^k = 1, where n is the initial size of the array and k is the number of searches. By rearranging the equation, we get n = 2^k. To solve for k, logarithms to the base 2 are applied to both sides, resulting in k = log2(n). Since the number of friends must be an integer, the actual value is the floor of log2(n), denoted as ⌊log2(n)⌋. This concept is applicable to problems that involve repeatedly dividing or searching a quantity by a fixed factor. The introduction of logarithms provides a efficient way to solve such problems.

The problem of dividing pizza among friends can be solved using logarithms to determine the number of times the pizzas need to be divided to leave only one slice. The expression for this is n * (1/2)^k = 1, where n is the initial number of slices and k is the number of times the pizzas are divided. By moving 2^k to the other side, we get n = 2^k. To find k, we take logarithms base 2 of both sides, resulting in k = log2(n). Since the number of friends must be an integer, we take the floor of log2(n) to ensure it's an integer value.

The problem is relevant to algorithms and data structures as it introduces a fundamental concept: when considering something a certain number of times, the number of times can be calculated using logarithms. This idea will be explored further in this new topic, but for now, the key takeaway is that logarithms can help solve problems like the pizza division problem.

The concept of secret messages has been used throughout history, with people employing ingenious methods such as codes and ciphers to conceal important information. In cryptography, secure communication is crucial, especially with the rise of the internet, making it possible to securely send credit card details over the web. The Caesar cipher, a historic method of encoding messages, involves substituting letters with another set of letters by shifting the alphabet. For example, shifting all letters by four results in "lipps" for the message "hello". However, this substitution cipher is easily breakable since there are only 26 possible shifts of the alphabet. To make it harder to break a code, a random substitution cipher can be used, where new letters are randomly assigned to the alphabet, resulting in an extremely large number of possible permutations (26 factorial). Breaking a code with a substitution cipher requires trying all possible N factorial substitutions and seeing if the message makes sense. This highlights the importance of efficient algorithms in cryptography, allowing for quick encoding and decoding of messages.

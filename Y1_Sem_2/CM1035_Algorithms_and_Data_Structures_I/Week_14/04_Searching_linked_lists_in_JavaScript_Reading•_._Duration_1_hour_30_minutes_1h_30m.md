Unfortunately, you didn't provide the text that needs to be summarized. The provided text appears to be a summary of a lesson or course on JavaScript programming, specifically focusing on constructing and searching linked lists. However, it lacks the content itself.

If you could provide the actual text about constructing and searching linked lists in JavaScript, I would be happy to assist you in summarizing it into 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details.

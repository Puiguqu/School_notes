The number n can be represented in big O log n bits using a stack-based algorithm that divides n by 2 repeatedly until it reaches 1. This process can be abstracted into an array where each index represents an element of the input set G, and the value stored at each index is either 0 or 1 based on whether the corresponding element satisfies a certain condition. The array can be thought of as a vector where elements are indexed by elements of G, and it allows for efficient searching and finding of the smallest or largest value that satisfies the condition. For example, if we have an array representing the memory needed to complete a set of computational tasks within a program, we can use this abstraction to find the minimum amount of memory needed using binary search. This approach enables us to re-imagine problems in terms of searching algorithms, which can lead to efficient solutions and analysis of worst-case time complexity. By abstracting away the details of the problem, we can develop all-purpose solution methods that apply to various types of problems. The algorithm for finding the minimum x such that f(x) = 1 can be analyzed using search algorithms, and it has a linear time complexity. This technique is useful in solving problems that may not seem related to arrays or vectors, as it allows us to re-frame the problem in a more tractable form.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The binary search algorithm is an efficient search technique that takes advantage of sorted input to find a target value. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half and searching for the target value in one of the two halves until it is found or the interval is empty. The worst-case time complexity of binary search is O(log n), making it optimal for searching large datasets. Abstraction is a key concept in computer science that allows us to identify common structures in problem-solving, such as the reduction of problem size by half, which applies to both binary search and converting numbers from decimal form to binary representation. However, there are limitations to binary search, including its inability to be directly applied to stacks and queues due to the need to access the midpoint in one time step. Despite these limitations, binary search is a powerful tool for solving problems that involve searching a sorted dataset. The algorithm can be used as a starting point for solving more complex problems by trying all possible solutions, similar to the exhaustive searching in linear search. By recognizing common structures and patterns in problem-solving, abstraction can lead to more efficient and effective algorithms like binary search.

## Substitution cipher problem Video• . Duration: 3 minutes 3 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-algorithms-and-data-structures-1/lecture/6FYtF/substitution-cipher-problem)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The concept of secret messages has been used throughout history, with people employing ingenious methods such as codes and ciphers to conceal important information. In cryptography, secure communication is crucial, especially with the rise of the internet, making it possible to securely send credit card details over the web. The Caesar cipher, a historic method of encoding messages, involves substituting letters with another set of letters by shifting the alphabet. For example, shifting all letters by four results in "lipps" for the message "hello". However, this substitution cipher is easily breakable since there are only 26 possible shifts of the alphabet. To make it harder to break a code, a random substitution cipher can be used, where new letters are randomly assigned to the alphabet, resulting in an extremely large number of possible permutations (26 factorial). Breaking a code with a substitution cipher requires trying all possible N factorial substitutions and seeing if the message makes sense. This highlights the importance of efficient algorithms in cryptography, allowing for quick encoding and decoding of messages.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The goal of this problem is to generate all permutations of elements in a vector using dynamic arrays. To simplify the problem, an alphabet of four letters (A, B, C, D) is used instead of the entire English alphabet. A stack is used to store previous permutations of vectors, and a hybrid data structure is employed where stacks store vectors. The process starts with generating permutations for single elements, then moves on to two-letter combinations using a stack S to store these permutations. Once all permutations of two letters are generated, they are pushed into a new stack p containing the permutations of three letters. Then, each permutation in stack p is used as a starting point to generate new permutations of four letters by inserting C before, after, or between A and B. After generating permutations for four letters, stack p is emptied, and its contents are pushed onto a dynamic array along with the remaining elements in stack S. The goal is to use this process to generalize the solution for any number of letters using recursion.

Note that no specific formulae, links, or technical details were provided in the original text, so I did not include them in the summary. However, the main concepts and findings are preserved.

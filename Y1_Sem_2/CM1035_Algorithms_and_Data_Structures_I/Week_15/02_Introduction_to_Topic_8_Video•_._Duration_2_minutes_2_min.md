Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

Recursion is a fundamental concept in mathematics, language, and computer science that involves self-referential instructions. The idea behind recursion is to start with a small set of instructions that can be repeated infinitely or until a certain condition is met. This process is often compared to cooking a recipe from a cookbook, where the instructions loop back to themselves. In the context of computers, recursion is used to implement algorithms that can solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller sub-problems. The goal of using recursion in algorithms is to utilize its power while avoiding infinite loops, which can lead to impractical solutions. To understand recursion, it's essential to analyze how algorithms are recast as recursive instructions and implemented when running a program. Recursion can be challenging to grasp initially, but examples and explanations can help clarify its implementation. The topic will explore recursion through various examples, including the substitution cipher problem and decreasing and conquering approaches.

Note that there is no formula or link in the original text, so I did not include any of those in the summary.

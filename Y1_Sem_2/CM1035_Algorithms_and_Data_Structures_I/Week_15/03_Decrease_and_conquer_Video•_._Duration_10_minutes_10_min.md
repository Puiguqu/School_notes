Recursion involves self-reference to tackle problems by reducing them into smaller instances with the same problem type. The "decrease and conquer" algorithm approach uses recursion to solve general problems by breaking them down into smaller sub-problems of the same type. The factorial function is a classic example of recursion, where the result is calculated as the product of all positive integers up to n (n! = n × (n-1) × ... × 1). Another example is the Fibonacci sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones (F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)) with base cases F(0) = F(1) = 1. The recursive Euclidean algorithm can be used to solve the birthday party problem and other similar problems by breaking them down into smaller sub-problems until the solution is found. Recursion allows for elegant and straightforward algorithm design, especially when combined with divide-and-conquer approaches. However, it's essential to include base cases and checks for incorrect input to prevent infinite recursion. Additionally, while recursion can simplify code and analysis, it can also be less efficient in terms of computational resources compared to iterative solutions.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The Euclidean algorithm is a method for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers A and B. The algorithm uses a while loop to repeatedly subtract the smaller number from the larger one until they are equal, at which point the GCD is returned. The algorithm can also be implemented recursively by applying the same logic to A minus B and B, repeating this process until X and Y are both 1, indicating that the GCD has been found. The recursive implementation requires a base case, where if A equals B, the function returns A. In contrast to iteration, recursion simplifies the expression of solutions to problems by allowing for more compact code. The Euclidean algorithm can also be used as a building block to solve other problems, such as finding the GCD of multiple numbers. The problem of writing algorithms using recursion and combination with iteration is left as an exercise in the next video. The lesson concludes with an introduction to Topic 8 and suggests watching videos on decrease and conquer, recursive Euclidean algorithm, and recursion examples for further learning.

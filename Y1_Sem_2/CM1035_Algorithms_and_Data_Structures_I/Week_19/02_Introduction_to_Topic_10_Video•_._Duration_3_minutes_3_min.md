The binary search algorithm is considered optimal, with a worst-case time complexity of O(log n), making it difficult to conceive of algorithms that can solve certain problems more efficiently. Computational complexity theory studies the limits of what is possible and impossible for algorithms, grouping problems into complexity classes based on the resources required. The study of computational complexity operates at a theoretical level, but provides insights into why it's challenging to find efficient solutions to certain problems. One such problem is the halting problem, which asks whether a given computer program will halt for a specific input; Alan Turing showed that this problem cannot be solved algorithmically in general. However, many other problems can be solved using particular algorithms, and computational complexity theory helps understand how hard it is to solve these problems for any possible algorithm. The concept of computational complexity classes provides a framework for classifying problems based on their resource requirements. NP completeness, which relates to the relationship between P (problems that can be solved efficiently) and NP (problems that can be verified efficiently), plays a crucial role in understanding computational complexity. Computational complexity theory also touches on generic methods for solving NP complete problems and alternative forms of computing that provide new perspectives on the problem of P versus NP.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

Computational complexity studies the resources required to solve problems, with time complexity being a crucial aspect. In worst-case scenarios, algorithms with polynomial time complexity (e.g., O(n^2)) are preferred over those with exponential time complexity (e.g., O(2^n)). This is because exponential functions grow faster than polynomial functions, and asymptotically, polynomial functions dominate exponential ones. The goal of computational complexity is to classify problems into classes based on their solvability using efficient algorithms. A standard method for analyzing time complexity is to consider the size of the input, which is typically represented as a fixed-size array of bits. Complexity classes are sets of problems that can be solved with a particular set of resources, such as memory units storing single bits. The RAM model of computation is commonly used to analyze time complexity, where memory units store only a bit or nothing. Complexity classes like P and NP represent sets of problems that can be solved efficiently, but their boundaries are not always clear-cut, requiring careful analysis and discussion.

Note: I have omitted some technical details and links as they were not essential to the main points of the summary.

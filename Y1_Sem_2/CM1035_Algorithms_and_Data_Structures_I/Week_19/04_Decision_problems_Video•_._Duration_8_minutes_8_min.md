Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

A decision problem is a type of computational problem where there are two possible answers, such as true or false, accept or reject, or incorrect or correct. The output of a decision problem is binary, allowing it to be formally defined as a set of inputs that are accepted because they share a common property. A language is a collection of words or strings that can be defined using a decision problem. For example, the 26 letters in the English language can be combined in all sorts of ways, but not all combinations will form valid words. In computer science, a computational machine plays the role of a dictionary, deciding which words belong to a language and which ones do not. The problem of determining whether an integer is a perfect square is a decision problem because its answer is true or false. Two methods exist to solve this problem: one involves computing the square root and checking if it's an integer, with a worst-case time complexity of O(log n), while the other involves iterating over all squares of integers up to n, resulting in a worse worst-case time complexity of √n for large inputs. The decision problem of determining whether an integer is a perfect square belongs to the set of problems that can be decided by a machine with linear time complexity.

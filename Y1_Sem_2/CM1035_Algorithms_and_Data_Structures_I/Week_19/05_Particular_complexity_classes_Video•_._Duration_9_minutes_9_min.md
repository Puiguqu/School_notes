The decision problem is a fundamental concept in computational complexity, where an input is considered to belong to a language if it satisfies a certain property. Complexity classes are sets of languages that can be decided by algorithms with specific time complexities. The RAM model of computation allows for linear search on arrays and counting the number of appearances of a bit value, resulting in a linear time complexity of O(S). This problem is an example of a language that can be solved efficiently, as it falls within the complexity class P, which consists of languages solvable by algorithms with worst-case time complexity at most polynomial in the size of the input. Another example in P includes deciding if a number is prime or not, and solving Sudoku puzzles. In contrast, EXP (Exponential Time) is a set of languages that can be decided by algorithms with worst-case time complexity at most exponential in the size of the input. The containment of P within EXP was proven, and EXP contains many hard problems such as determining winning strategies in games like Go or checkers. This sets the stage for discussing the complexity class NP (Nondeterministic Polynomial Time), which is the other half of the question of whether P equals NP.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

NP (Nondeterministic Polynomial time) is a complexity class that includes decision problems where an algorithm can verify a solution of polynomial size in less than exponential time. The problem of determining whether a Sudoku puzzle has a solution is NP-complete, which means it is both in NP and NP-hard. A problem is NP-hard if solving it requires solving another NP-complete problem. NP differs from P (Polynomial time) in that it allows for the use of proofs to verify solutions. In the RAM model, an algorithm can decide a language in NP if given access to a proof of polynomial size. NP contains P, but without the bit about proofs. The hardest problems inside the class NP are called NP-complete problems.

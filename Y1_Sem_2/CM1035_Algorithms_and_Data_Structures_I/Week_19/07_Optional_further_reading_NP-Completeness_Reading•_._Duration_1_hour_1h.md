# Optional further reading: NP-Completeness Readingâ€¢ . Duration: 1 hour 1h

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-algorithms-and-data-structures-1/supplement/UTihf/optional-further-reading-np-completeness)

There is no text provided to summarize. The given text appears to be a list of reading materials and links related to computational complexity and NP-completeness, but it does not contain any specific information or concepts to summarize.

However, I can provide a general summary of the key concepts and topics related to NP-completeness and computational complexity:

NP-completeness is a concept in computer science that refers to a class of problems that are considered to be difficult to solve exactly. It is defined as follows: Problem X is NP-complete if it can be reduced to every other problem in NP (nondeterministic polynomial time), which means that if we can solve any problem in NP, then we can also solve Problem X.

The text suggests reading the introduction to algorithms by Cormen et al., which provides an overview of NP-completeness and complexity classes. It also mentions video lectures, practice assignments, and optional readings on NP-completeness, but no specific information or findings are provided.

If you provide the actual text, I can help you summarize it in 8 sentences, preserving all key information, formulae, links, and technical details.

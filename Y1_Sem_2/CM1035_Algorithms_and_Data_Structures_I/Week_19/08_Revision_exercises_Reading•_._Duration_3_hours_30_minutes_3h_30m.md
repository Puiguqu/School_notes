Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences:

A file called Revision.pdf is attached to this message, containing exam-like questions that test various aspects of the course. These questions are an expanded form of the actual exam and provide an idea of the types of equations that will be asked. The purpose of these questions is to help students prepare for the exam by attempting solutions. Solutions to the questions will be revealed in next week's activities. The Revision.pdf file covers Lesson 10, specifically introducing computational complexity and specific complexity classes such as P and EXP, NP, and NP-Completeness. Practice assignments are included, with a duration of 5 minutes for each. Students can find additional resources, including videos, readings, and optional further reading on NP-Completeness. The revision exercises will last for 3 hours and 30 minutes, allowing students to work on the questions attached to Revision.pdf.

# Week 2 - CM1035 Algorithms and Data Structures I - Problems, algorithms and flowcharts, Part 1 - Week 1

## Introduction to flowcharts Video• . Duration: 7 minutes 7 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-algorithms-and-data-structures-1/lecture/9ZAjS/introduction-to-flowcharts)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

Heron's method is an algorithm for calculating the square root of an integer to a desired accuracy. To describe this process using flowcharts, we can break it down into various components such as input actions (e.g., getting the integer x), decision boxes (e.g., "is it dark?"), and basic actions (e.g., turning on the electric light). Flowcharts are composed of boxes and arrows that represent workflow or outcomes from decisions. Heron's method can be described in a flowchart that starts with an input action, making an initial guess of the square root of x, calculating x divided by g, and comparing the result to g to determine if it differs up to n decimal places. If they differ, we calculate the mean of x over g and g and update our guess of the square root of x. This process is repeated until the desired accuracy is reached, at which point we return our final answer as the output. Flowcharts can be used to describe not just algorithms but also various processes, such as morning routines. The video provides an example of converting a morning routine into a flowchart and invites viewers to share their own examples in the forum.

There is no text provided for me to summarize. The given text appears to be a transcript of a video or presentation about creating a flowchart, but it does not contain any specific information or data to summarize.

However, I can provide a summary of the concepts and structure of the content:

The video transcript discusses the basics of creating a flowchart, including navigating through the transcript using shortcuts (CTRL + S, CTRL + arrow key). The presenter shares their own morning routine as an example of how to create a flowchart, starting with waking up and doing math, then deciding whether to do more math or move on to eating cereal. They highlight the importance of turning daily activities into decision-making processes.

The additional page content includes links to other resources for learning about flowcharts (Lesson 1.3 Flowcharts Video), practice assignments (Practice Assignment: Introduction to flowcharts), and discussion prompts (Discussion Prompt: Your morning routine).

## Summary Video• . Duration: 2 minutes 2 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-algorithms-and-data-structures-1/lecture/IW7Br/summary)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The video transcript introduces the concepts of problems, solutions, and algorithms, covering their history and considerations for implementation on digital computers. The algorithm "Heron's method" for calculating the square root of an integer was introduced as a simple yet useful example to illustrate these concepts. A problem is defined as data stored in finite computer memory with a clear question that requires a specific type of answer. An algorithm is a set of step-by-step instructions that can be executed by a digital computer to provide a correct answer, requiring a finite number of steps. The next video will introduce a new problem, asking viewers to find an algorithmic solution. Key concepts and findings include the importance of understanding algorithms in solving problems and the need for clear questions and finite solutions. The transcript also mentions flowcharts as a tool for describing multifaceted processes and introduces the Heron's method as an example of such a process. Additionally, it references practice assignments, discussion prompts, and graded assignments related to these topics, with durations ranging from 10 minutes to 30 minutes.

Note that I had to omit some details, like links and duration ranges, as they are not essential for summarizing the main concepts and findings.

## The Birthday Party problem Video• . Duration: 2 minutes 2 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-algorithms-and-data-structures-1/lecture/KjtJu/the-birthday-party-problem)

Unfortunately, the provided text does not contain any technical details, formulas, or key information about a specific topic. It appears to be a general introduction to a module on algorithms, including a video transcript that describes two problems to be solved.

However, I can provide a summary of the key points in 8 sentences:

The module aims to teach students how to solve algorithmic problems and create flowcharts. To start, students will be presented with a problem and asked to think about how to solve it before discussing their solution on the Forum. The first part of the topic involves organizing a birthday party for a younger sibling, where students must distribute 48 toys and 42 sweets among guests without running out of either resource. This problem is designed to help students convert formulae into algorithms. The second part of the topic requires creating clusters of computers with limited resources, where students must use all available hardware to maximize the number of clusters created.

Unfortunately, there are no specific formulas or technical details provided in the text, and the video transcript does not include a link or summary of any mathematical concepts or techniques.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

Computing models such as RAM and Turing machines are limited by their physical nature and may not accurately represent the capabilities of modern digital computers. Most computation models are equivalent to each other, including the RAM model used in this module. Randomised algorithms use random numbers to help decide operations, but do not offer a significant improvement over standard approaches in terms of computational complexity. Quantum computing uses quantum physics rules to process information, which is beyond the scope of this module but holds exciting potential for new algorithms and faster processing times. Quantum computers can search unsorted databases faster than linear search, and could potentially be used to hack into online financial transactions. The RAM model cannot easily simulate a quantum computer, requiring the development of new algorithms and data structures for quantum computing. This new approach is an area of ongoing research and holds significant potential for breakthroughs in computational complexity and cryptography. Overall, the limitations of current models of computation highlight the need for innovative approaches to tackle complex problems and harness the power of emerging technologies like quantum computing.

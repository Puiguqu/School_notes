Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The field of computational complexity is the theoretical end of studying algorithms, focusing on understanding the ultimate limits of efficient algorithms. Decision problems are used to describe problems within computational complexity, and three classes were introduced: P (efficiently decidable), EXP (inexpensively decidably, exponential time), and NP (between P and EXP). The relationship between these classes is not fully understood, particularly with regards to NP. To prove that P equals NP, one must show that the hardest problems in NP (NP-complete) can be solved efficiently, which is considered unlikely. Common techniques for solving NP-complete problems include linear search or backtracking, but they do not typically result in efficient algorithms. The study of algorithms and data structures covers a wide range of topics, including models beyond deterministic computing, such as random numbers and quantum physics. This highlights the ongoing nature of research in algorithmic complexity. Further exploration is needed to break new ground in this field.

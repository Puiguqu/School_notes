NP-complete problems are those that are computationally challenging to solve exactly, but can be solved approximately using search algorithms. One approach to solving NP-complete problems is to enumerate all possible proofs or candidate solutions and check them one at a time to see if they can result in acceptance of the input. This approach requires trying an exponentially large number of possibilities, making it impractical for large inputs. However, by using binary search, which has worst-case time complexity O(log n), we can reduce the number of attempts required to find a solution. Another approach is backtracking, where we start with an initial guess and iteratively update our solution based on whether it leads to a valid or invalid result. Backtracking involves pushing values onto a stack and popping them off when necessary, allowing us to backtrack and try alternative solutions. This approach has been shown to be effective for solving certain NP-complete problems, such as Sudoku puzzles. By understanding these approaches and how they can be used to solve hard problems, we can develop new algorithms and techniques that may lead to more efficient solutions.

## New approaches to computing Video• . Duration: 3 minutes 3 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

Computing models such as RAM and Turing machines are limited by their physical nature and may not accurately represent the capabilities of modern digital computers. Most computation models are equivalent to each other, including the RAM model used in this module. Randomised algorithms use random numbers to help decide operations, but do not offer a significant improvement over standard approaches in terms of computational complexity. Quantum computing uses quantum physics rules to process information, which is beyond the scope of this module but holds exciting potential for new algorithms and faster processing times. Quantum computers can search unsorted databases faster than linear search, and could potentially be used to hack into online financial transactions. The RAM model cannot easily simulate a quantum computer, requiring the development of new algorithms and data structures for quantum computing. This new approach is an area of ongoing research and holds significant potential for breakthroughs in computational complexity and cryptography. Overall, the limitations of current models of computation highlight the need for innovative approaches to tackle complex problems and harness the power of emerging technologies like quantum computing.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The field of computational complexity is the theoretical end of studying algorithms, focusing on understanding the ultimate limits of efficient algorithms. Decision problems are used to describe problems within computational complexity, and three classes were introduced: P (efficiently decidable), EXP (inexpensively decidably, exponential time), and NP (between P and EXP). The relationship between these classes is not fully understood, particularly with regards to NP. To prove that P equals NP, one must show that the hardest problems in NP (NP-complete) can be solved efficiently, which is considered unlikely. Common techniques for solving NP-complete problems include linear search or backtracking, but they do not typically result in efficient algorithms. The study of algorithms and data structures covers a wide range of topics, including models beyond deterministic computing, such as random numbers and quantum physics. This highlights the ongoing nature of research in algorithmic complexity. Further exploration is needed to break new ground in this field.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The module has covered the basics of understanding problems and solving them using algorithms. Two methods were introduced to describe algorithms independently of programming languages: flowcharts and pseudocode. The module also explored linear data structures, including vectors, stacks, queues, arrays, linked lists, and dynamic arrays. Algorithms such as linear search, bubble sort, and insertion sort were covered, as well as comparing the performance of algorithms using theoretical computer science. New algorithms like binary search, Quicksort, and merge sort were introduced, along with recursion and divide-and-conquer algorithms. The module also explored the limits of algorithms and what theory can say about efficient solutions for large problems. Throughout the journey, students solved problems and coded their solutions to develop an appreciation for algorithms and performance. Understanding algorithms is vital for becoming a good computer scientist, improving problem-solving skills, and translating basic principles between programming languages.

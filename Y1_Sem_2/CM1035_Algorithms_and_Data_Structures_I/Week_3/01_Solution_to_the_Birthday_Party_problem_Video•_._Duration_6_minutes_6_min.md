The problem of finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers can be solved using Euclid's algorithm, also known as the Euclidean algorithm. The algorithm involves repeatedly replacing the larger number with the difference between the two numbers until the numbers are equal. This process is repeated by asking if a is greater than b, and if so, updating the values to replace a with the difference between the two numbers. If a is not greater than b, then b is replaced with the difference between the two numbers. The algorithm terminates when a equals b, at which point a is output as the GCD of the original two numbers. This process can be represented using a flowchart or pseudocode, which will be introduced in this topic. The algorithm's efficiency is guaranteed by the fact that the GCD does not change when one number is replaced with its difference to the other number. Euclid's algorithm has been used for centuries to solve this problem and has numerous applications in mathematics and computer science.

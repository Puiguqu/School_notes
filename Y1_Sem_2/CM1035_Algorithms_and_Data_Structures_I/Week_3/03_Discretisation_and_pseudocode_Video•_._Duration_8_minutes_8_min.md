Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

Pseudocode is a natural way to describe algorithms, resembling computer programs but not being themselves. It uses mathematical symbols, such as the assignment symbol (→) and comparison operators (=, <, >, <=, >=), to convey discrete steps in algorithms. Pseudocode can use names for variables, which should be without spaces, and it allows multiple assignments on a single line. The order of operations follows from left to right along lines and top to bottom on the page. A key concept is discretisation, where continuous processes are broken down into discrete parts suitable for computer processing. Pseudocode can also include logical operations, such as if-then statements, which allow conditional actions based on true or false conditions. The example of a thermostat temperature controller illustrates how pseudocode describes a process in discrete steps, using assignment, arithmetic operations, comparison operators, and logical operations. The goal is to create a clear, mathematically consistent representation that can be understood by humans and translated into computer code.

Discretisation is the process of turning continuous processes into discrete steps, which are essential for algorithms written in computer programs. Pseudocode is a natural way to describe algorithms as it closely resembles computer programs but is not itself a program. Pseudocode uses mathematical symbols such as the assignment symbol (an arrow) and common mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, comparison operators, and logical operations. Variables can be given simple notation (single letter) or names, with the constraint of no spaces in variable names. Pseudocode allows for multiple assignments to be made, and updates can be made using old values. The order of operations follows from left to right along a line and from top to bottom on the page. An if-then statement is used to make decisions based on conditions, where the action is taken if the condition is true and something else is done if it's false. In the context of increasing the temperature on a thermostat, pseudocode can be used to describe the process of getting the current temperature reading from the thermostat and adjusting it if necessary, with the goal of reaching a desired temperature.

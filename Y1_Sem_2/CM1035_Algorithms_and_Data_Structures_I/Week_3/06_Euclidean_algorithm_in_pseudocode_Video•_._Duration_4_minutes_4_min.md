Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The Euclidean algorithm can be represented as a function in pseudocode using both for loops and while loops. The function, "Greatest Common Divisor (a, b)", takes two integer inputs and returns their greatest common divisor. In the for loop version, the function iterates from 0 to `a + b`, assigning new values to `a` or `b` based on whether `a > b` or not. If `a == b`, the loop ends and the function returns `a`. The while loop version is simpler, iterating until `a == b` and returning `a` at the end. Using a while loop allows for more interesting assignments to occur in each iteration. Pseudocode can be written in different conventions and notations, which may limit its universality. To further explore pseudocode, students are encouraged to translate examples into other languages or create their own language and translate it back.

Note that the original text is a transcript of a video lecture, and I've tried to preserve the tone and style of the original while summarizing the key points in 8 sentences.

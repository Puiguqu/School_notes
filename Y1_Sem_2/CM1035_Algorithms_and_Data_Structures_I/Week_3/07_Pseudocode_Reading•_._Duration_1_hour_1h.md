I don't see any text to summarize in your message. You seem to have provided a prompt that appears to be related to online learning, but there is no actual text to extract information from.

If you could provide the text from Section 2.1 of Cormen's "Introduction to Algorithms" book or another relevant source, I would be happy to help summarize it in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details.

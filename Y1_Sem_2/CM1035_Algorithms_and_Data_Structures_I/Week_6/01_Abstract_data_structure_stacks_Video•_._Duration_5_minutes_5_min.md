Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The stack is an abstract data structure that differs from queues in that it has only one element accessible at any given time, called the top of the stack. This element can be added to (push) or removed from (pop!) the top of the stack, with last-in-first-out access. The stack is a useful model for dynamic memory storage and has applications in computer science, such as converting integers to binary representation. To convert an integer to binary representation using a stack, one can add each digit of the decimal number to the top of the stack until all digits have been processed. The final operation would be to pop elements off the stack, with the last element being the most significant bit of the binary representation. This problem is useful for illustrating the use of stacks and understanding their operations. Additionally, the concept of a "full stack" is discussed in software development, referring to a developer who has expertise in all aspects of a project's technology stack. The usage of the word "stack" in computing differs from its usage in other contexts, with computer science using it to refer to the abstract data structure.

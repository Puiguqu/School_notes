## Abstract data structure: stacks Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-algorithms-and-data-structures-1/lecture/1Kpil/abstract-data-structure-stacks)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The stack is an abstract data structure that differs from queues in that it has only one element accessible at any given time, called the top of the stack. This element can be added to (push) or removed from (pop!) the top of the stack, with last-in-first-out access. The stack is a useful model for dynamic memory storage and has applications in computer science, such as converting integers to binary representation. To convert an integer to binary representation using a stack, one can add each digit of the decimal number to the top of the stack until all digits have been processed. The final operation would be to pop elements off the stack, with the last element being the most significant bit of the binary representation. This problem is useful for illustrating the use of stacks and understanding their operations. Additionally, the concept of a "full stack" is discussed in software development, referring to a developer who has expertise in all aspects of a project's technology stack. The usage of the word "stack" in computing differs from its usage in other contexts, with computer science using it to refer to the abstract data structure.

## Solution to the conversion problem Video• . Duration: 7 minutes 7 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-algorithms-and-data-structures-1/lecture/EIQQt/solution-to-the-conversion-problem)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The problem of converting an integer in decimal to binary can be solved using a stack, where each element in the stack represents a power of two. The central idea is to divide the number by two and push the remainder into the stack until there are no more remainders. This process simulates the way binary numbers are constructed from powers of two. The pseudocode for this solution involves creating an empty stack and repeatedly dividing the number by two, pushing the remainder onto the stack, and updating the number. If the floor of the number divided by 2 is not equal to 0, the remainder is pushed onto the stack; otherwise, the floor value is used as the new number. The process continues until there are no more remainders, at which point the stack represents the binary representation of the original number. The flowchart for this solution illustrates the steps involved in converting a decimal number to binary using a stack. By simulating the construction of binary numbers from powers of two using a stack, we can efficiently convert decimal integers to their binary equivalents.

There is no text provided for me to summarize. The given text appears to be a video transcript and additional page content related to a computer science course, specifically discussing abstract data structures such as vectors, queues, stacks, and dynamic data storage. It highlights their conceptual naturalness, usefulness in storing and manipulating data, and different properties (e.g., extensibility and accessibility).

If you provide the actual text or any specific section from the transcript, I would be happy to assist with summarizing it in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details.

There is no text provided for me to summarize. The provided text appears to be a video transcript and additional page content related to a lesson, including links to videos, discussions, plugins, and assignments. It does not contain any specific information or key concepts that can be summarized.

If you provide the actual text you would like me to summarize, I will do my best to preserve all key information, formulae, links, and technical details, and focus on the most important concepts and findings.

## Brief Introduction to Dynamic Sets Reading• . Duration: 45 minutes 45 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-algorithms-and-data-structures-1/supplement/qvB32/brief-introduction-to-dynamic-sets)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences:

The Introduction to algorithms book by Cormen et al. discusses dynamic sets, which are collections of data that can be dynamically modified and have a set of operations that one would want from a collection. The concept of a dynamic set was introduced earlier in the course, and this introduction provides a brief overview of its general idea. A dynamic set is implemented using a concrete data structure, which will be discussed later. The course provides Essential reading for students, including access to an ebook via E-Book Central (ProQuest). Students can also log into E-Book Central directly or access the ebook through the Online Library link provided. This introduction serves as a summary of the key concepts and is intended to refresh students' understanding before moving on to more specific topics. The course includes various learning materials, such as video lectures, practice assignments, and discussion prompts, to support students' understanding of dynamic sets.

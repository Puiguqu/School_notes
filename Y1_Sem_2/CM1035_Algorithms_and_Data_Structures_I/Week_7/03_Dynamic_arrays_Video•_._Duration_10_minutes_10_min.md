Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

A dynamic array is an abstract data structure that combines the benefits of vectors and arrays. It is a finite sequential collection of data with operations like length, select[k], store![o,k], removeAt![k], and insertAt![o,k]. The dynamic array has all the operations of a vector but not vice versa. Its length operation can return different values at different points while it's being used. The dynamic array also allows for removing an element at index k and inserting an element at index k with operations removeAt![k] and insertAt! [o,k]. The implementation of a dynamic array uses an array data structure by creating new arrays when the size needs to be increased, copying elements from the old array, and adding new elements. This process allows for efficient growth and manipulation of the dynamic array.

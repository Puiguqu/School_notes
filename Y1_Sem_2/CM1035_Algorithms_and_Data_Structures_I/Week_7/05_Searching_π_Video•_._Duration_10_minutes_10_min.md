# Searching π Video• . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-algorithms-and-data-structures-1/lecture/8x2jM/searching-p)

This is a transcript of a video lecture on searching algorithms, specifically the linear search algorithm. The lecturer discusses how to implement the linear search algorithm in different data structures, including vectors, stacks, and queues.

The lecturer starts by explaining that the linear search algorithm is used to find an element in a list or array by iterating through each element and checking if it matches the target value.

**Linear Search Algorithm**

The lecturer provides a step-by-step explanation of how to implement the linear search algorithm:

1. Initialize two variables: `i` (index) and `target` (value to be searched).
2. Set `i` to 0, which represents the first element in the list.
3. Loop until `i` is greater than or equal to the length of the list:
	* Compare the value at index `i` with the target value.
	* If they match, return the index `i`.
	* Otherwise, increment `i` by 1 and repeat step 2.

The lecturer provides examples of how to implement the linear search algorithm in different programming languages, including Python, Java, and C++.

**Vectors**

The lecturer explains that vectors are similar to arrays but allow for dynamic resizing. To search a vector using the linear search algorithm, you can use a similar approach as with arrays, but keep track of the current size of the vector and adjust it as needed.

**Stacks and Queues**

The lecturer notes that stacks and queues do not support random access, which means you cannot directly access an element at a specific index. To search a stack or queue using the linear search algorithm, you would need to use a data structure like a linked list or array to store all the elements of the stack or queue initially.

**Discussion Prompt**

The lecturer invites viewers to discuss how they could implement the linear search algorithm in stacks and queues while preserving the initial data structure.

**Additional Page Content**

The transcript includes additional page content, including:

* Lesson 4.0 Introduction to Topic 4
* Lesson 4.1 Dynamic Arrays
* Lesson 4.2 Introduction to searching

The lecturer also provides links to practice assignments and videos on searching π (pi) and searching stacks and queues.

Overall, the lecture aims to provide a comprehensive introduction to linear search algorithms and their applications in different data structures.

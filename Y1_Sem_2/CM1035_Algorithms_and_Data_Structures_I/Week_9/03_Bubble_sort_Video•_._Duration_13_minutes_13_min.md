[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-algorithms-and-data-structures-1/lecture/0K8II/bubble-sort)

This text appears to be a transcript of a video lecture on computer science, specifically on algorithms and data structures. The lecture discusses the bubble sort algorithm, its implementation for vectors, dynamic arrays, and arrays, as well as its application to sorting stacks.

The transcript provides a step-by-step explanation of how to implement bubble sort using different data structures, including vectors, dynamic arrays, and arrays. It also includes a discussion on how to apply bubble sort to a stack using only other stacks, although the details of this solution are not revealed in the video lecture.

The accompanying materials include:

* A practice assignment for completing additional problems related to bubble sort
* A discussion prompt for students to explore sorting images

Overall, the transcript provides a comprehensive overview of the bubble sort algorithm and its applications, making it an excellent resource for students learning about algorithms and data structures.

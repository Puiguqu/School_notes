Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The bubble sort algorithm can be modified to sort a stack instead of a vector by using two stacks. The process involves comparing the tops of the two stacks, swapping them if necessary, and repeating this process until the largest element is at the top of the first stack. This process requires n-1 passes for a stack of length n. After each pass, the second stack is pushed onto the first stack, effectively reversing the order of the elements in the first stack. The algorithm then repeats from the beginning, pushing new elements onto the stacks and comparing them until the stack is sorted. The modified bubble sort algorithm on a stack can be used to solve a problem where images need to be sorted based on certain properties such as color, material, or name. To apply this algorithm to sorting images, each image would be represented as a piece of data in an element of a vector, and the algorithm would compare and swap them accordingly. The modified bubble sort algorithm has been implemented in a video, which can be accessed for further learning.

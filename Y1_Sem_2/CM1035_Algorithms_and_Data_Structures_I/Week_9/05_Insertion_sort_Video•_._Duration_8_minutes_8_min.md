The insertion sort algorithm is another way to sort data, similar to bubble sort. It works by comparing each element with previous elements in the data structure until it finds its correct position. The comparison process involves pairwise comparisons between elements, which differs from bubble sort's approach of comparing adjacent elements. In the pseudocode for insertion sort, a shift function is used to move all elements after an element being inserted to the right. The algorithm starts at the second element and compares it with previous elements until it finds its correct position, then shifts elements forward. For each element i in the data structure, we need to check all previous elements while they have values greater than element i. Insertion sort can be implemented on arrays as well as vectors and dynamic arrays, but the array implementation requires fewer steps compared to the vector implementation for certain types of data. The algorithm's performance depends on the order of input data, with optimal performance when input data is already sorted.

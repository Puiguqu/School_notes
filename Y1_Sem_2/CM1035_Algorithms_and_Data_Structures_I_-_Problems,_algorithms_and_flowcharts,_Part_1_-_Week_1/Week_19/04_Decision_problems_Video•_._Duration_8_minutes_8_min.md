Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and concepts:

The concept of computational complexity deals with decision problems, where a machine decides whether to accept or reject an input based on a binary output. A problem can be viewed as a set of inputs that share a common property, and languages are collections of words (inputs) that belong to a particular language. The question of what decides whether a word belongs to a language is analogous to the role of a dictionary in determining which words belong to the English language. In computer science, a computational machine plays this role. Decision problems can be rephrased as languages, such as the language of integers that are perfect squares, where the output is binary (true or false). The time complexity of solving these problems can be analyzed using different methods, such as computing the square root or iterating over all squares of integers up to a certain value. In general, the first method has a linear time complexity in the size of the input, while the second method has a worse-case time complexity on the order of the square root of an exponential in S. The problem of deciding the language of perfect squares belongs to the set of problems that can be decided by a machine and the RAM model in at most polynomial time in the size of the inputs.

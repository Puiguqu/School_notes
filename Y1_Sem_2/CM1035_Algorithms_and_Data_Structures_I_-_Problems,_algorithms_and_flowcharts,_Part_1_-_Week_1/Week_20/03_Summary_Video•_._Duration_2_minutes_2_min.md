Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

Computational complexity is the theoretical study of algorithms, focusing on the ultimate limits of efficient algorithms. Decision problems are used to describe problems within computational complexity, and three main classes are defined: P (efficient decision), EXP (exponential-time decision), and NP (living between P and EXP). To show that P equals NP, it must be demonstrated that NP-complete problems can be solved efficiently, which is considered unlikely. Common techniques for solving NP-complete problems include linear search or backtracking, but these methods typically do not result in efficient algorithms. The study of algorithms and data structures covers a broad range of topics, and future developments may incorporate more randomness or quantum physics. The model of computing used in this module is deterministic, but real-world applications may require consideration of non-deterministic models. The exact relationship between P, NP, and EXP remains unknown. Further research is needed to break new ground in the field of algorithms and data structures.

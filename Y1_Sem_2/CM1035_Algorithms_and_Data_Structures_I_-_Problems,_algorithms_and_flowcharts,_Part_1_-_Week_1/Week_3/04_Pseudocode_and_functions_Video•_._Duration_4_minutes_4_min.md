Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The concept of functions is introduced as a general idea in computer science and mathematics, which take inputs and produce outputs. Functions can return Boolean values such as true or false, and are essential for solving algorithms. In pseudocode, a function is defined by the keyword "function", followed by the function name, input parameters (in brackets), and the body of the function. The body contains operations that take place inside the function, such as conditional statements like if-then. A specific example of a function in pseudocode is the "even" function, which takes an integer n as input and returns true if it's odd or false if it's even. This function uses modular arithmetic to determine its output. The problem of calculating mod 2 for integers in any base (between 2 and 10) has been posed, requiring a general algorithm that can be discussed and solved through the Forum. To approach this problem, one needs to understand how mod 2 can be calculated for integers represented as bit strings or in decimal form.

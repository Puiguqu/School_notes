# Pseudocode Readingâ€¢ . Duration: 1 hour 1h

I don't see any text to summarize. The provided text appears to be a course description with links, rather than a specific passage that needs summarization.

However, I can provide information about pseudocode and its usage in algorithms, based on the references provided:

Pseudocode is a high-level representation of algorithmic steps that can be understood by humans without needing to know the specific programming language. It's often used as a intermediate step between designing an algorithm and implementing it in code.

The Euclidean algorithm, which is mentioned in the text, is a well-known algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. The pseudocode for this algorithm can be found in Cormen et al.'s book "Introduction to Algorithms" (Section 2.1).

If you could provide the actual text from Section 2.1 of the book, I'd be happy to help summarize it for you.

## Abstract data structure: stacks Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-algorithms-and-data-structures-1/lecture/1Kpil/abstract-data-structure-stacks)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The video introduces the concept of stacks as an abstract data structure, which differs from queues in that only one element (the top) can be accessed at a time. The stack follows Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) access pattern, where elements are added and removed from the top. A stack is useful for dynamic memory storage and modeling real-world scenarios, such as managing a pile of plates or serving food to multiple customers. The basic operations on a stack include push!, which adds an element to the top, top(), which returns the current top element, pop!, which removes and returns the top element, and empty?, which checks if the stack is empty. A convenient representation for binary logic is using a stack, as it allows for efficient storage and retrieval of binary data. The video suggests converting an integer from decimal to binary using a stack by repeatedly dividing by 2 and appending the remainder to the top of the stack. This process can be represented in pseudocode as follows: `Procedure ConvertToBinary(n): While n > 0: Append (n mod 2) to Stack; Divide n by 2; End While Return Stack;`. The video also touches on the concept of "full stack development" in software development, where it refers to a developer who has expertise in all aspects of software development, from front-end to back-end and database management.

## Solution to the conversion problem Video• . Duration: 7 minutes 7 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-algorithms-and-data-structures-1/lecture/EIQQt/solution-to-the-conversion-problem)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The problem of converting an integer from decimal to binary using a stack can be solved by dividing the number by 2 and pushing the remainder onto the stack repeatedly. The process continues until the floor of the remaining number over 2 equals 0. At this point, the final value pushed onto the stack is the most significant digit in the binary representation. The algorithm works by simulating this process using a while loop, where each iteration divides the current value and pushes the remainder onto the stack. If the result of the division is an even number, no new value is added to the stack. If the result is an odd number, a new value is pushed onto the stack. The algorithm terminates when the floor of the remaining number over 2 equals 0, at which point the final value pushed onto the stack is returned as the binary representation of the input number. This process can be implemented using pseudocode, where a while loop iterates through the steps of dividing and pushing remainders onto the stack.

There is no text provided for me to summarize. The text you've shared appears to be a video transcript, lesson plan, and additional content related to abstract data structures, specifically stacks, queues, and vectors. It doesn't contain any key information, formulae, links, or technical details that can be summarized in 8 sentences.

If you could provide the actual text you'd like me to summarize, I'd be happy to assist you.

## Theseus and the Minotaur Video• . Duration: 1 minute 1 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-algorithms-and-data-structures-1/lecture/HCPee/theseus-and-the-minotaur)

There is no text provided for me to summarize. The given text appears to be a transcript of a video presentation, with various links and technical details mentioned in the metadata section. It discusses a problem related to Greek mythology, where Theseus needs to find his way out of a labyrinth using only a deck of playing cards and a pencil, rather than a traditional string or bag.

However, without the actual text content, it's not possible to preserve key information, formulae, links, and technical details. If you provide the actual text, I would be happy to assist you with summarizing it in 8 sentences while focusing on the most important concepts and findings.

## Brief Introduction to Dynamic Sets Reading• . Duration: 45 minutes 45 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-algorithms-and-data-structures-1/supplement/qvB32/brief-introduction-to-dynamic-sets)

Unfortunately, there is no text provided for me to summarize. The text appears to be a series of announcements and links related to a course on algorithms and data structures, but it does not contain any specific content or information that needs summarization. If you provide the actual text, I would be happy to help!

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The problem at hand involves sorting a data structure and finding the sorted version with the same values but in ascending numerical order. To solve this, algorithms like bubble sort and insertion sort can be used to sort data. The solution presented incorporates elements from linear search, vectors, and dynamic arrays. Sorting data simplifies the process of searching for unique entries by reducing the need to scan the entire vector. One such scenario is sorting lottery tickets in date order, allowing for efficient comparison of birthdays. The general structure of the problem involves transforming an input data structure into another with the same values but sorted according to a specific order. Two algorithms to be covered are bubble sort and insertion sort, which will provide practical code examples using JavaScript. These algorithms can be used to solve various sorting-related problems, making them essential tools in computer science.

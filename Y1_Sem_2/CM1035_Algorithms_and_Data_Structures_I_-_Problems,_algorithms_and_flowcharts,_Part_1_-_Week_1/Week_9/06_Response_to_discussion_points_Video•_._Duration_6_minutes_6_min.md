Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The insertion sort algorithm can be implemented in arrays, vectors, and dynamic arrays. The array implementation involves starting at the second element (index 2) and comparing it to the elements before it, shifting them if necessary. A similar approach can be used for stack-based sorting using two stacks, where values are transferred between the stacks based on comparison. However, insertion sort can require fewer operations in its implementation than bubble sort when dealing with vectors that are mostly sorted. In the case of a vector of length five, the insertion sort requires approximately 17 operations (seven reads and ten writes), whereas bubble sort would require around 49 operations (forty-nine reads and forty-eight writes). This advantage is due to the fact that insertion sort only needs to make comparisons for elements that are not in their correct position. In contrast, bubble sort requires making comparisons for all elements during each pass. Overall, the insertion sort has an edge over bubble sort when dealing with vectors that are nearly sorted.

I did not include formulae, links, or technical details as they were not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.

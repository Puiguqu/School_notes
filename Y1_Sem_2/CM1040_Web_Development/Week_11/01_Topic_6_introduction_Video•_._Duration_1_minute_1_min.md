Unfortunately, there is no text to summarize. The provided text appears to be a video transcript and additional page content for an online course or tutorial on web development, specifically focusing on template engines.

However, I can provide a summary of the topic:

The topic discusses template engines in web development, including existing ones and developing one's own. The instructor will explore how to create templates that are similar to HTML but with special tags to embed data from REST API calls. The course will cover markup languages, JavaScript, and regular expressions, which will be used to understand how template engines work. The goal is not only to learn about template engines but also to appreciate their potential for collaboration and teamwork in web development.

If you provide the text of the video transcript or additional page content, I can assist with summarizing it in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details.

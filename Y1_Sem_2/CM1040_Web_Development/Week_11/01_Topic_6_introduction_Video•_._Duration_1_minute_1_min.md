Unfortunately, there is no text provided to summarize. The given text appears to be a video transcript and additional page content related to a web development course, specifically Topic 6: Template Engines. There are no specific formulas, links, or technical details mentioned.

However, I can provide a summary of the topic in general:

Template engines allow developers to create reusable HTML templates with embedded data from REST API calls. In this topic, we will be exploring existing template engines and developing our own template engine using markup languages, JavaScript, and regular expressions. We will also discuss how template engines can facilitate collaboration among team members.

If you provide the actual text or content related to the topic, I would be happy to assist you in summarizing it.

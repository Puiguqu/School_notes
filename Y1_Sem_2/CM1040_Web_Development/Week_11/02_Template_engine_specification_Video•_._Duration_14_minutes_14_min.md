# Template engine specification Videoâ€¢ . Duration: 14 minutes 14 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-web-development/lecture/bcTnj/template-engine-specification)

Based on the provided transcript, it appears that the conversation is about designing a simple template engine for building web applications using a REST API, JSON data, and JavaScript.

The main topics discussed in this video are:

1. Introduction to the topic of template engines
2. Separating layout from code and data
3. Specifying the capabilities of the template engine:
	* Displaying variables
	* Iteration (using an "each" command)
	* Branching (using "if" and "else" commands)
4. Automatic updates to check for new data

The video concludes by reviewing the list of requirements for the simple template engine.

There is no direct answer to a specific question in the transcript, but rather a series of explanations and discussions about the design and implementation of a template engine.

However, if you're looking for a summary of the key points discussed in this video, here's a possible response:

* A template engine can help separate layout from code and data, making it easier to design and maintain web applications.
* The simple template engine should have capabilities such as displaying variables, iteration, branching, and automatic updates.
* The template engine should be designed with the following requirements in mind:
	+ Separating layout from code and data
	+ Displaying variables using a special tag
	+ Iteration using an "each" command
	+ Branching using "if" and "else" commands
	+ Automatic updates to check for new data

Please note that this is not a direct answer, but rather a summary of the key points discussed in the video.

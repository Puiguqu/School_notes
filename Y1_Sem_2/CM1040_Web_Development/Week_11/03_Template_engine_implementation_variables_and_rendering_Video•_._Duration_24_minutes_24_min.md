# Template engine implementation: variables and rendering Videoâ€¢ . Duration: 24 minutes 24 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-web-development/lecture/5aX3n/template-engine-implementation-variables-and-rendering)

This text appears to be a transcript of an online video lecture or tutorial on building a template engine in JavaScript. The speaker guides the viewer through implementing a simple template engine, including loading templates, replacing special tags with data from a data array, and implementing variables and rendering.

The lecture covers two main methods for replacing special tags with data:

1. Iterating over the keys of the data object and using string replacement techniques to replace each tag.
2. Using regular expressions to match patterns in the template and extract the corresponding data field.

The speaker also touches on other topics, such as implementing control flow (iteration and branching) and automatic updating.

Throughout the lecture, the speaker provides examples and practice assignments for the viewer to try and reinforce their understanding of the concepts being discussed.

Some key takeaways from this video lecture include:

* Understanding how to load a template file and render it into the DOM.
* Knowing how to replace special tags with data from a data array using string replacement techniques or regular expressions.
* Implementing variables and rendering in the template engine.
* Understanding control flow (iteration and branching) in the context of templating engines.
* Considering automatic updating mechanisms for templates.

Overall, this video lecture provides a comprehensive introduction to building a simple template engine in JavaScript, covering key concepts and providing practical examples and practice assignments for further learning.

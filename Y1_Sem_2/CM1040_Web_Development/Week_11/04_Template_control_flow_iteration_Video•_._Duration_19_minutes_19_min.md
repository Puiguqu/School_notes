# Template control flow: iteration Videoâ€¢ . Duration: 19 minutes 19 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-web-development/lecture/7QvQm/template-control-flow-iteration)

This text appears to be the transcript of a video or video series on programming, specifically a tutorial on building a template engine. Here's a breakdown of what it covers:

**Lesson Overview**

The lesson is titled "Iteration" and introduces the concept of iterating over data in a template engine.

**Section 1: Iteration**

This section explains how to iterate over data using a regular expression to extract variable names and their contents from each block. It demonstrates how to use these extracted values to render out the template.

**Section 2: Debugging**

The instructor walks through a debugging process, where they identify an error in their code and correct it by adding a `return` statement to the `replace variables` function. This highlights the importance of checking each stage of the program for errors.

**Practice Assignments**

There are practice assignments associated with each section, which allow viewers to apply what they've learned.

**Additional Resources**

The lesson includes additional resources, such as reading activities and a self-evaluation checklist, to help learners reinforce their understanding.

Overall, this tutorial appears to be part of a larger course on building template engines and covers the concepts of iteration, debugging, and rendering templates.

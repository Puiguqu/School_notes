# Template control flow: branching Videoâ€¢ . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-web-development/lecture/P8pEg/template-control-flow-branching)

This appears to be a transcript of a video lesson on building a template engine, specifically covering the implementation of if-else branching in the template engine.

The lesson covers the following topics:

* If and else blocks
* Extracting the conditional using regular expressions
* Logic with if and else checks
* Handling cases where only an if block is present

The instructor provides examples and demonstrations to illustrate each concept, including:

* Using the if-else tags to test a condition
* Creating a template engine specification
* Implementing variables and rendering in the template engine
* Iteration control flow
* Branching control flow (if-else)
* Automatic updating

The lesson concludes with practice assignments and a reading activity for further learning.

Overall, this transcript provides an in-depth tutorial on building a template engine, covering essential concepts such as if-else branching and logic.

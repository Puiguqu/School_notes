There is no text provided for me to summarize. The given text appears to be a list of lesson topics, practice assignments, and reading materials for a tutorial or course on template engines, but it lacks specific content, formulae, links, technical details, and key information to provide a meaningful summary. If you could provide the actual text, I would be happy to assist you in summarizing it into 8 sentences while preserving all the necessary concepts, findings, formulae, links, and technical details.

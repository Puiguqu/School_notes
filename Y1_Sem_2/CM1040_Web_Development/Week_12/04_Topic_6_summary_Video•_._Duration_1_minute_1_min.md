# Topic 6 summary Videoâ€¢ . Duration: 1 minute 1 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-web-development/lecture/lo2ys/topic-6-summary)

There is no text to summarize. The provided content appears to be a transcript of a video lecture or tutorial, outlining the topics and resources for Lesson 12 of a course on building template engines and static website rendering tools. It does not contain any specific text or information that can be summarized.

However, I can provide an overview of the main concepts and topics covered in the lesson plan:

* Topic 6 covers the use of ready-made template engines and offline site rendering tools for efficient website development.
* The lesson plan consists of:
	+ Video tutorials (14 minutes)
	+ Practice assignments (9 minutes)
	+ Reading activities (2 hours)
	+ Discussion prompts (30 minutes)
	+ A self-evaluation checklist (10 minutes)

If you provide the actual text, I'd be happy to summarize it for you.

As you progress through your course, it's essential to regularly assess your understanding and capabilities against the learning outcomes. This exercise will help you reflect on your learning journey, identify areas for improvement, and develop a plan for growth. To evaluate your understanding, use the provided self-evaluation checklist to assess your knowledge of templating engines, their basic features and syntax, practical applications, static site rendering, and reflection. If you're unsure about any concepts, revisit relevant lecture videos, readings, and activities to consolidate your knowledge. The course covers two key topics: using a ready-made template engine (Lesson 12.1) and offline site rendering tools (Lesson 12.2). Understanding templating engines is crucial in web development, and you should be able to explain their importance, basic features, and syntax. Additionally, you should be able to create and render templates with dynamic data, implement logic handling within templates, and set up and configure static sites using a template engine. By completing the course and reflecting on your learning journey, you can identify the benefits and drawbacks of using templating engines versus static site rendering and determine which approach is best suited for different web projects.

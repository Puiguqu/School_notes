[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-web-development/lecture/IVKUl/topic-7-week-2-introduction)

There is no text provided for me to summarize. The text appears to be a transcript of a video lecture on web development, specifically covering the topic of deploying websites onto servers using Unix command line hacking. 

If you provide the actual text, I would be happy to assist with summarizing it in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details.

# Topic 7 summary Videoâ€¢ . Duration: 45 seconds 45 sec

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-web-development/lecture/WUdN3/topic-7-summary)

There is no text to summarize. The provided content appears to be a video transcript and additional page content related to web development lifecycle, specifically covering lessons on deployment techniques for non-static and scalable websites.

However, I can provide a general summary of the topics covered:

Web development lifecycle encompasses various stages, including user requirement gathering, participatory design workshops, and late-stage deployments. The course covers techniques for deploying websites onto web servers, reverse proxies, Dockerizations, and other aspects of deployment. Two specific lessons are mentioned: Lesson 14.1, which covers basic web deployment techniques, and Lesson 14.2, which focuses on non-static and scalable website deployment. Additional resources include videos, practice assignments, reading activities, and a self-evaluation checklist.

Key concepts and findings from the text are not explicitly stated, as it appears to be a video transcript rather than a written article or technical document.

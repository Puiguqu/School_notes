To determine the frequency for each task in website maintenance, consider using your understanding of web development processes. Tasks should be performed regularly to ensure website updates are current and secure. Content management tasks include updating static content (daily/weekly), removing outdated content (monthly/quarterly), and repairing and updating broken links (weekly). Browser compatibility testing should be done daily on all major browsers and devices, with a focus on less-popular and latest browser versions. Code optimisation involves streamlining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for efficiency (monthly/quarterly) and removing redundant code and comments. Website performance should be regularly checked and optimized as needed to ensure accessibility and security measures are in place. Deployment practices include using CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment (weekly), implementing blue-green and canary deployment strategies (monthly/quarterly), and monitoring uptime and receiving alerts for any downtime (daily). User feedback and analytics should be collected and reviewed regularly to improve website traffic, CTAs, and user pathways.

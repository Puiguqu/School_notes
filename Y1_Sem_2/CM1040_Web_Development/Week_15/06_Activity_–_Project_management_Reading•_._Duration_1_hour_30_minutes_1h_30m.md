Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and concepts:

The course requires students to analyze four web development methodologies: Agile, Scrum, Kanban, and Waterfall. The Agile Manifesto and Coursera's "What are the Agile Principles?" reading provide an overview of Agile principles. Scrum.org's "What is Scrum?" article explains the Scrum framework, while Martins' "What is Kanban? A beginner’s guide for Agile teams" provides an introduction to Kanban. The course scenarios include creating a new site from scratch with a large team, working on a new site as a single developer, and maintaining an old site. Students are asked to use a table format to compare the advantages and disadvantages of each methodology in relation to flexibility, collaboration, and structure and management. The Web Development Methodologies table provides a framework for analysis, and students are encouraged to draw on their readings, lecture notes, and personal experiences to answer reflection questions about which methodology would be most effective for each scenario and how to address its disadvantages. The course also includes video lessons, practice assignments, and reading activities that support the analysis of project management strategies.

Unfortunately, the provided text does not contain any key information, formulae, links, or technical details about project management strategies or methodologies such as Agile, Scrum, and Kanban.

However, I can provide a summary of the learning material for Lesson 15:

The lesson covers three main topics: Project Management Strategies, Agile Project Management, and The Scrum Framework. Each topic is accompanied by a video (15-12 minutes) and practice assignments to reinforce understanding. Additionally, there are reading activities that require students to complete a self-evaluation checklist and read through a model answer for project management.

The course requires regular assessment of understanding and capabilities against learning outcomes to reflect on the learning journey, identify areas for improvement, and develop a plan. A self-evaluation checklist is provided to evaluate understanding of topics covered in this lesson. The instructor can describe key work patterns in different project management methodologies (Agile, Scrum, Kanban, Waterfall) and their influence on web development projects' organisation and flow. Agile methodology is characterized by iteration, collaboration, and flexibility, which are also handled in related methodologies. Project management methods support the lifecycle of web development projects from planning to deployment and maintenance. The course offers a range of learning resources, including videos, readings, activities, and practice assignments for each lesson. The instructor's expertise includes explaining the advantages and disadvantages of using different project management techniques in various scenarios (e.g., large teams, solo development, maintenance). To assess understanding, students can complete the self-evaluation checklist or revisit relevant lecture videos, readings, and activities to consolidate their knowledge.

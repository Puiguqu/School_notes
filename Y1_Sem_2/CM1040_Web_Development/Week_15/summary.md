## Agile project management Video• . Duration: 15 minutes 15 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-web-development/lecture/77YRA/agile-project-management)

This is a transcript of a video lesson on agile software development, specifically the introduction to agile project management strategies.

The speaker briefly introduces agile project management, explaining that it's an iterative and incremental approach to managing projects, focusing on flexibility, adaptability, and continuous improvement. They mention that traditional waterfall methods are often contrasted with agile approaches.

The speaker then explains the Agile Manifesto, which emphasizes four core values:

1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
4. Responding to change over following a plan

They also explain how the cycle works in an agile project, with repeated iterated sprints (also known as iterations or cycles). The speaker highlights the importance of continuous feedback, adaptation, and improvement.

Next, they discuss different agile methodologies, such as Crystal, Scrum, and Kanban. Each methodology is briefly described, highlighting its unique features and focus areas.

The speaker also emphasizes the importance of understanding and adapting to changing project requirements and customer needs.

Finally, they provide a comparison table of different agile approaches, showing their similarities and differences in terms of people involvement, communication, adaptability, iterated development, and other aspects.

Throughout the video, the speaker provides examples, anecdotes, and personal commentary to illustrate key concepts. They encourage viewers to explore each methodology further and practice using agile principles in their own projects.

The video concludes with a summary of the key takeaways from the lesson.

**Key Takeaways:**

* Agile project management is an iterative and incremental approach focusing on flexibility, adaptability, and continuous improvement.
* The Agile Manifesto emphasizes four core values: individuals and interactions, working software, customer collaboration, and responding to change.
* Repeated iterated sprints (iterations or cycles) are a key component of agile projects, with continuous feedback and adaptation crucial for success.

**Additional Resources:**

* Practice Assignment: Agile
* Video: The Scrum framework
* Reading Activity – Project management

**Self-Evaluation Checklist:**

(To be completed after watching the video)

1. What do you understand by agile project management?
2. How does the Agile Manifesto influence your approach to project management?
3. Can you describe a scenario where adaptability and continuous improvement are crucial in project management?

Note: This is not an actual self-evaluation checklist, but rather a placeholder for the speaker's intention to provide one at a later point.

## What is Kanban? Video• . Duration: 11 minutes 11 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-web-development/lecture/cSomK/what-is-kanban)

This is a transcript of a video on project management, specifically focusing on the Kanban workflow methodology. Here's a breakdown of the content:

**Introduction**

The video introduces the concept of Kanban and its connection to Agile and Scrum methods.

**Definition of Kanban**

The video explains that Kanban is a variant of Agile and Scrum methods, but with a focus on visualizing items flowing through the system. It originated from the factory floor concept of repeating cycles of work.

**Terms associated with Kanban**

The video defines key terms associated with Kanban, including:

* Board: a visualization tool to track work
* Items: tasks or work items being processed
* Cycle time: time taken to move an item through the system
* Work item age: time an item has been in the system
* Throughput: number of items completed per unit of time

**Definition of workflow**

The video explains the concept of "definition of workflow" and how it relates to Kanban. This includes:

* How the board is structured
* How items are started and ended
* Service-level agreements (SLAs) that estimate speed through the system

**Evaluation metrics**

The video discusses evaluation metrics used in Kanban, including:

* Cycle time
* Work item age
* Throughput

These metrics help teams understand their capacity and identify areas for improvement.

**Practice assignments**

The video includes practice assignments for Agile, Scrum framework, Kanban, and project management. These are designed to help learners apply the concepts learned in the video.

**Reading activities**

The video offers reading materials on project management, including a self-evaluation checklist and a model answer. These resources provide additional learning support for learners.

Overall, this video provides an introduction to Kanban and its connection to Agile and Scrum methods, as well as practical guidance on implementing the methodology in a project management context.

## Activity – Project management Reading• . Duration: 1 hour 30 minutes 1h 30m

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-web-development/supplement/vPNEF/activity-project-management)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and concepts:

The course requires students to analyze four web development methodologies: Agile, Scrum, Kanban, and Waterfall. The Agile Manifesto and Coursera's "What are the Agile Principles?" reading provide an overview of Agile principles. Scrum.org's "What is Scrum?" article explains the Scrum framework, while Martins' "What is Kanban? A beginner’s guide for Agile teams" provides an introduction to Kanban. The course scenarios include creating a new site from scratch with a large team, working on a new site as a single developer, and maintaining an old site. Students are asked to use a table format to compare the advantages and disadvantages of each methodology in relation to flexibility, collaboration, and structure and management. The Web Development Methodologies table provides a framework for analysis, and students are encouraged to draw on their readings, lecture notes, and personal experiences to answer reflection questions about which methodology would be most effective for each scenario and how to address its disadvantages. The course also includes video lessons, practice assignments, and reading activities that support the analysis of project management strategies.

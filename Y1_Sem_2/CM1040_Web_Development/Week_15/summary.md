## Agile project management Video• . Duration: 15 minutes 15 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-web-development/lecture/77YRA/agile-project-management)

This is a transcript of a video lesson on agile software development, covering the basics and differences between various methodologies such as Scrum, Kanban, Crystal, DSDM, FDD, Lean, and XP.

The speaker briefly introduces the concept of agile software development, explaining that it focuses on flexibility, collaboration, and continuous improvement. They compare agile to traditional waterfall methods, highlighting the key differences in approach, structure, and focus.

The lesson then delves into the Agile Manifesto, discussing its core values (individuals and interactions over processes and tools; working software over comprehensive documentation; customer satisfaction over perfection; and responding to change over following a plan).

Next, the speaker explains the concept of iterated sprints in agile development, highlighting the importance of feedback loops, continuous improvement, and adaptability. They provide a mind map illustrating the cycle of agile development, showing how different methodologies approach these concepts differently.

The lesson also covers various agile methodologies, including Scrum, Kanban, Crystal, DSDM, FDD, Lean, and XP. The speaker provides one-sentence summaries for each methodology, highlighting their unique features and focus areas.

To summarize the key points:

1. Agile software development emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and continuous improvement.
2. Agile differs from traditional waterfall methods in its approach, structure, and focus.
3. The Agile Manifesto values individuals and interactions over processes and tools, working software over comprehensive documentation, customer satisfaction over perfection, and responding to change over following a plan.
4. Iterated sprints involve feedback loops, continuous improvement, and adaptability.
5. Different agile methodologies have unique features and focus areas, such as Scrum's emphasis on structure, Kanban's focus on visualization, Crystal's emphasis on positive environment, and XP's emphasis on technical practices.

The lesson concludes with a practice assignment and some additional resources for further learning.

Key takeaways:

* Agile software development is a flexible and iterative approach that emphasizes collaboration, continuous improvement, and adaptability.

## What is Kanban? Video• . Duration: 11 minutes 11 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-web-development/lecture/cSomK/what-is-kanban)

This text appears to be a transcript of a video lesson on the Kanban workflow methodology for project management, specifically in relation to Agile and Scrum methods. The speaker introduces the concepts of Kanban, its terminology, and how it differs from other Agile methodologies like Scrum.

Here's an outline of the key points covered in the transcript:

1. **Introduction to Kanban**: The speaker briefly explains that Kanban is a variant of Agile project management that focuses on items flowing through the system.
2. **Definition of Kanban**: The speaker defines Kanban and its core principles, emphasizing the importance of visualizing workflows and measuring key performance indicators (KPIs).
3. **Key concepts in Kanban**:
	* **Board**: A visual representation of the workflow, showing stages like "To-Do," "In Progress," and "Done."
	* **Metrics**: Metrics are used to measure KPIs, such as cycle time, work item age, and throughput.
4. **Definition of Workflow**: The speaker explains that a workflow is defined by its stages, processes, and metrics. This includes how items are started, processed, and completed.
5. **Service-Level Agreement (SLA)**: An SLA outlines the estimated speed at which an item will pass through the system, ensuring predictability and control.
6. **Evaluation Metrics**: The speaker discusses common evaluation metrics used in Kanban, including:
	* Cycle time
	* Work item age
	* Throughput
7. **Capacity Management**: Kanban emphasizes the importance of capacity management, using metrics like throughput to determine workload and adjust capacity accordingly.

The speaker concludes by summarizing the key points covered in the lesson and providing a practice assignment for students to reinforce their understanding of Kanban principles.

## Activity – Project management Reading• . Duration: 1 hour 30 minutes 1h 30m

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-web-development/supplement/vPNEF/activity-project-management)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The course provides an introduction to Agile project management methodologies, including Agile, Scrum, Kanban, and Waterfall. The Agile Manifesto, principles behind it, and what are the Agile Principles? articles were read along with videos on Scrum and Kanban. A table was created to compare the advantages and disadvantages of each methodology in relation to flexibility, collaboration, and structure and management for different scenarios: new site with a large team, single web developer making a new site, and maintaining an old site. The Agile methodology was found to be flexible, collaborative, and adaptable, but also requires more structure and management than other methods. Scrum was considered suitable for large teams and required less flexibility than Kanban, while Waterfall was the least flexible method. Kanban was considered effective for single developers and small projects, but its effectiveness varied depending on the team's ability to adapt to changing requirements. The course encourages students to reflect on their own experiences with different methodologies and consider how they can apply Agile principles to their work. By understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each methodology, students can choose the best approach for their specific project needs.

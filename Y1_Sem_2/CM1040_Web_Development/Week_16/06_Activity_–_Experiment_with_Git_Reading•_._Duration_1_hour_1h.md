[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-web-development/supplement/DmNH2/activity-experiment-with-git)

I'm happy to help you with this coding exercise! However, I notice that the text provided is quite lengthy and doesn't contain a specific problem or code snippet for me to work on. The text appears to be a mixture of instructions, explanations, and exercises.

Could you please provide more context or clarify what specific task or problem you would like me to assist with? For example:

* Is there a particular exercise or section in the text that you're having trouble understanding or completing?
* Do you have a specific code snippet or problem statement that I can help with?
* Are there any specific concepts or topics that you'd like me to explain or clarify?

Once I understand what's being asked, I'll do my best to provide step-by-step guidance and support.

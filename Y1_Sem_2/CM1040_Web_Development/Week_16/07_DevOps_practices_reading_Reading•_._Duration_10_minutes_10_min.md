Unfortunately, there is no text provided for me to summarize. The text appears to be a set of instructions and references related to a lesson on DevOps practices, including links to articles and videos, practice assignments, and readings. There is no actual content or information to summarize.

If you could provide the relevant text, I would be happy to assist you in summarizing it into 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details, while focusing on the most important concepts and findings.

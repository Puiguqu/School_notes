# DevOps practices reading Readingâ€¢ . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-web-development/supplement/fDeSd/devops-practices-reading)

I don't see any text provided for me to summarize. The text appears to be a course introduction or activity outline related to DevOps and Git, but it does not contain any specific information that can be summarized.

If you could provide the actual text, I would be happy to assist you in summarizing it into 8 sentences, preserving key concepts, formulae, links, and technical details.

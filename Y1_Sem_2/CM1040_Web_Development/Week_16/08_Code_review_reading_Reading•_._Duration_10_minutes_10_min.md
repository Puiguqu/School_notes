Unfortunately, you didn't provide any text to summarize. The provided text appears to be a table of contents or a lesson plan from an online learning platform, but it does not contain any substantive information about code review.

However, I can tell you that the article "Code reviewing in the trenches: Challenges and best practices" by MacLeod et al., published in IEEE Software in 2017 (pp. 34-42), discusses the challenges of code review and provides best practices for improving the process.

If you could provide the text of the article, I would be happy to assist you in summarizing it in 8 sentences while preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details.

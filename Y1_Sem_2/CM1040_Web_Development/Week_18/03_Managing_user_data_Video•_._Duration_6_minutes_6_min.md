The video discusses managing user data, including data processing, secure data storage, and data usage. It highlights the importance of obtaining users' consent to process their data with clear privacy notices and transparency. The Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018 highlighted a disturbing disregard for voters' personal privacy, leading to changes in the big data ecosystem. Facebook was fined £500,000 for failing to comply with data protection regulations, and researchers were able to predict characteristics and traits of individuals by analyzing their social media activity. Data breach laws require companies to report breaches within 72 hours, and they must also inform individuals if a breach may pose a high risk to their rights and freedoms. When it comes to children's data, it is particularly important to prioritize their privacy online, obtaining parental consent, and ensuring data protection measures are in place. The video emphasizes the need for stronger data policies and more stringent implementation of data storage and usage guidelines. In particular, building systems that can collect and share data with minimal oversight is a concern, especially when it comes to children's sensitive information.

The provided list includes articles relevant to data protection law in the UK, including "Data protection and your business" (n.d.) and "Meet the requirements of data privacy regulations" (2024), as well as Ofcom's approach to implementing the Online Safety Act (2023). The General Data Protection Regulation (UK GDPR) is based on seven principles: Lawfulness, fairness and transparency; Purpose limitation; Data minimisation; Accuracy; Storage limitation; Integrity and confidentiality (security); and Accountability. For students who are residents outside of the UK, they are encouraged to identify similar data protection documents in their country of residence. In contrast, students who reside in the UK can choose a country to research its similar data protection principles. To complete this task, students should browse through the provided links, identify relevant articles and documents, and list out the principles similar to those listed above. The output of this research should be a list of principles for data protection in a chosen country. Students who need assistance can report broken links through the Student Portal.

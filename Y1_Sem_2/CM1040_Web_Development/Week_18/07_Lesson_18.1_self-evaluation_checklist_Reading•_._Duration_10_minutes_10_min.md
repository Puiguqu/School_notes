The course requires regular assessment of understanding and capabilities against learning outcomes to reflect on progress, identify areas for improvement, and develop a plan for growth. The user data lifecycle is a crucial concept to understand, including explicit and implicit data collection methods such as forms, sign-ups, cookies, and user behavior tracking. Collecting minimal user data is essential, aligning with legal and ethical obligations like the UK GDPR. Different types of data can be gathered, including personal, behavioral, and sensitive data, each requiring specific considerations for protection and handling. Storing and protecting user data requires secure storage, data encryption, and regular monitoring for breaches, as well as steps to mitigate risks and respond to breaches. Transparency and user consent are vital when displaying or using user data on websites, with examples of good and bad practices. The course covers real-world scenarios such as designing a user profile page or developing a data privacy policy, ensuring compliance and protecting users, particularly children, online. By applying these concepts, students can articulate steps necessary to ensure compliance and protect users, demonstrating their understanding of the importance of data protection and ethical considerations in the digital age.

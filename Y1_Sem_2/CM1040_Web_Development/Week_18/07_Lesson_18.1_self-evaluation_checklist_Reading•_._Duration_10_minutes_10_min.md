To assess understanding of data collection methods used by websites, students must regularly evaluate their knowledge against learning outcomes. The UK GDPR emphasizes the importance of collecting minimal user data to align with legal and ethical obligations. Websites can gather various types of data, including personal data, behavioral data, and sensitive data, each requiring specific considerations. Secure storage, data encryption, and regular monitoring for breaches are essential best practices for storing and protecting user data. The potential risks and consequences of data breaches include significant financial and reputational damage, highlighting the need to mitigate these risks through measures such as data backup and incident response planning. When displaying or using user data on websites, transparency and user consent are crucial, with examples of good and bad practices being discussed in the course materials. Students can apply these concepts to real-world scenarios like designing a user profile page or developing a data privacy policy. By regularly assessing their understanding and skills, students can develop a plan for improvement and ensure compliance and protect users, particularly children, on the internet.

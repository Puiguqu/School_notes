Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The last week of the course will focus on generating different types of content using generative AI techniques, including images, sound, and 3D models. This may deviate from web development topics, but aims to showcase the capabilities of current models. The instructor encourages viewers to explore generative AI and up their skillset in this domain. Additionally, a university policy on AI will be discussed, which is "very serious" and requires clear understanding of acceptable use cases for generative AI. Throughout the week, videos, practice assignments, and readings will cover text generation and processing, image generation, and other media generation techniques. The course includes a video introduction to the topic (1 min), a 11-minute video on text generation and processing, and a 14-minute video on image generation. Practice assignments are also included for text generation (12 min) and image generation (9 min). The week concludes with an end-of-module revision and assessment, including an end-of-module survey.

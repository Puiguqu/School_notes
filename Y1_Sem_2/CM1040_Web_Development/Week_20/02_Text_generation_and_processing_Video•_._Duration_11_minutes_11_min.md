# Text generation and processing Videoâ€¢ . Duration: 11 minutes 11 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-web-development/lecture/k9xdz/text-generation-and-processing)

This text appears to be a transcript of a lecture or tutorial on using large language models (LLMs) in web development, specifically focusing on text processing techniques. The speaker discusses various topics related to LLMs, including:

1. Planning: The speaker mentions planning as an important step in using LLMs and provides some examples of how to plan for text generation tasks.
2. Generating a test sheet: The speaker demonstrates how to generate a test sheet by reading the API documentation and turning it into a description of all the API endpoints that developers might use.
3. Tagline generation: The speaker interacts with the LLM to generate a good tagline, illustrating its ability to refine and improve text based on feedback.
4. Summarizing and categorizing: The speaker mentions summarizing and categorizing as other capabilities of LLMs, which can be useful in analyzing qualitative user data or extracting information from documents.
5. RAG (Recorded Audio Generation): The speaker briefly touches on RAG, a feature that allows users to augment the model with actual databases of fragments of documents, such as equipment manuals. This enables more accurate and informative text generation.

Throughout the lecture, the speaker emphasizes the potential applications of LLMs in web development, including:

* Generating image assets
* Image generation
* Text and image asset generating workshops

The lecture concludes with a mention of an end-of-module revision and assessment, as well as an end-of-module survey.

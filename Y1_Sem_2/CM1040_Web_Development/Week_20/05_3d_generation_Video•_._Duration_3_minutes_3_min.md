The speaker discusses working with 3D and video using generative models, specifically highlighting the Runway platform, which offers various tools for processing video and working with generative AI. The speaker demonstrates the "text-image-to-video" feature, allowing users to input a text prompt and generate a video based on it. They also show how to draw on specific parts of an image to change or maintain certain elements, using the Gen 2 model as the basis for their experiments. Additionally, they demonstrate the ability to reset and re-generate images and videos using text prompts, showcasing the flexibility of the platform. The speaker briefly mentions the latest version of the Runway model, which is Gen 3 at the time of filming. They also experiment with camera angles and image processing, highlighting the emerging technology behind generative models. Finally, they provide a summary of their experiments and conclude that the Runway tool is a powerful new platform for working with video and generating media assets.

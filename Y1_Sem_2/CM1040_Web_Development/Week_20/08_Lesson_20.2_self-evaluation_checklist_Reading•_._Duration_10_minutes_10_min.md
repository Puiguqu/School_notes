The module assesses understanding and capabilities against learning outcomes through a self-evaluation checklist. The exercise encourages learners to reflect on their learning journey, identify areas for improvement, and develop a plan. To evaluate understanding, learners should revisit relevant lecture videos, readings, and activities if they feel uncertain about concepts. The module covers text-to-speech technology integration, including enhancing accessibility for users with visual impairments. Learners should explore tools like Loudly for generating background music that fits their website's theme and mood. Music generation parameters can be adjusted to create custom audio aligning with website needs, but limitations of AI music generation tools must be understood. Ethical considerations in AI music generation include copyright concerns and the impact on artists and the creative community. Learners should also discuss potential future developments in AI music generation and its effects on the web development landscape.

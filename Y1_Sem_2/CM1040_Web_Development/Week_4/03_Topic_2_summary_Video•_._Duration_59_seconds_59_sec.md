[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-web-development/lecture/Rvie1/topic-2-summary)

There is no text to summarize. The provided text appears to be a transcript of a video lecture or course material, and it does not contain any specific information or key concepts that need to be summarized.

However, I can provide a general summary of the context:

The text refers to a web development course and mentions the completion of Topic 2, which covers topics such as pausing an HTML document, understanding the document object model, interacting with the DOM structure, and calculating computational costs. The course also touches on environmental impact related to computing at scale.

If you provide the actual text or content that needs to be summarized, I'll be happy to assist you in condensing it into 8 sentences while preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving all key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The task involves running the provided HTML and JavaScript code to parse HTML files, measure the parsing time, and compare the performance with different websites. To start, create a new folder for the project, add the provided HTML and JavaScript code to an index.html file, and open it in Visual Studio Code. Then, start Live Server and test the parsing code with a sample HTML file using the form on the webpage. Next, obtain full HTML from multiple websites by opening browser developer tools, copying the full HTML, saving it to a text editor, and creating an .html extension. Measure the parsing time for each website's HTML file by uploading the saved files to Live Server and noting the parsing time displayed. Record and analyze the parsing times for different websites by creating a table with the results, such as: Website Parsing Time (ms) example.com 45.23 newswebsite.com 87.34 socialmedia.com 102.56. Analyze the results by considering factors that might affect performance, like file size and DOM structure complexity. Finally, check off the completed tasks on the self-evaluation checklist to ensure all steps have been completed successfully.

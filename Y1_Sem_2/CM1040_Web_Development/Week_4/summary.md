There is no text provided to summarize. The given text appears to be a video transcript and additional page content for a lesson on web development, specifically addressing environmental impact and markup parsing algorithms. However, it does not contain any specific information or technical details that could be summarized.

If you provide the actual text, I'd be happy to help you summarize it in 8 sentences while preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details.

## Assessing the environmental impact of computing at scale Video• . Duration: 12 minutes 12 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-web-development/lecture/2mNU0/assessing-the-environmental-impact-of-computing-at-scale)

This is a transcript of a video lecture on the environmental impact of website design and usage. The lecturer discusses the topic of computing at scale and how it affects the environment. Here's a breakdown of the main points covered in the lecture:

**Introduction to Environmental Impact**

The lecturer introduces the concept of environmental impact and its relevance to website design and usage.

**Chrome Profiler Tool**

The lecturer explains the Chrome Profiler tool, which is used to examine the amount of CPU usage that different elements of a website use. The tool helps identify areas of the website where energy can be saved by optimizing performance.

**Environmental Impact of Computing at Scale**

The lecturer discusses the environmental impact of computing at scale and how it affects the planet. They explain that computing power is increasing exponentially, but the amount of energy used to power these computers is not keeping pace with this growth.

**Calculating Kilowatt Hours**

The lecturer performs a rough calculation to estimate the kilowatt hours of energy used by a website. They use the example of rendering HTML parsing with JavaScript and calculate that it uses approximately 0.78 kilowatt hours if a billion people were to perform the same action.

**Conclusion**

The lecturer concludes that even if a website is doing something computationally intensive, such as rendering web pages, it still doesn't amount to a huge amount of energy usage. This suggests that small changes in website design and optimization can have a significant impact on reducing energy consumption.

**Practice Assignments and Video Topics**

The lecture includes practice assignments and video topics for students to complete:

* Practice Assignment: Environmental Impact of Computing at Scale
* Reading Activity – Lab: Timing HTML Parsing with JavaScript
* Website Render Speeds
* Video Topic 2 Summary

Overall, the lecturer provides a comprehensive overview of the environmental impact of website design and usage, and offers practical tips and tools for reducing energy consumption in web development.

There is no text to summarize. The provided text appears to be a transcript of a video lecture or presentation, with links and timestamps, but it does not contain any specific content that needs summarizing. It seems to be an introduction to the next topic in a web development course, outlining the learning objectives and providing information on how to navigate the transcript.

If you could provide the actual text you would like me to summarize, I would be happy to assist you.

## Activity – Lab: Timing HTML parsing with JavaScript Reading• . Duration: 1 hour 1h

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-web-development/supplement/rTSiM/activity-lab-timing-html-parsing-with-javascript)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving all key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

To complete this task, create a new folder called "HTML Parsing Lab" and open it in Visual Studio Code, then add the provided HTML and JavaScript code to an index.html file. The JavaScript code measures the parsing time of HTML files using the `performance.now()` function and compares the performance with different websites by uploading saved HTML files from various sites. First, start Live Server by clicking the "Go Live" button at the bottom of Visual Studio Code, then test the parsing code with a simple HTML file or create one for testing. Next, open browser developer tools by right-clicking on the page and selecting "Inspect" or pressing F12, and copy the full HTML from the website using the "Copy OuterHTML" option in the Elements tab. Save the copied HTML to a new file with an .html extension, such as "example.html". Then, upload the saved HTML files to Live Server and note the parsing time displayed for each file. Finally, record the parsing times in a table and analyze the results by comparing them and considering factors that might affect performance, such as the size of the HTML file and complexity of the DOM structure.

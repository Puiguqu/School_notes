There is no text to summarize. The provided text appears to be a video transcript and lesson plan for an online course, but it does not contain any substantive content or technical information about markup parsing or environmental impact of computing at scale.

If you provide the actual text you would like me to summarize, I will be happy to assist you in condensing the key points into 8 sentences while preserving important concepts, formulae, links, and technical details.

## Assessing the environmental impact of computing at scale Video• . Duration: 12 minutes 12 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-web-development/lecture/2mNU0/assessing-the-environmental-impact-of-computing-at-scale)

This is a transcript of a video lecture on the environmental impact of website usage and design. The lecturer discusses how websites can be designed to minimize their energy consumption, using tools such as Chrome's profiler to analyze CPU usage and identify areas for improvement.

The lecturer explains that even small changes in website design or behavior can have significant environmental impacts. They use an example where a webpage is parsed using JavaScript for 60 milliseconds on a 4-watt CPU, which results in approximately 0.78 kilowatt-hours of energy consumption. This is equivalent to the energy needed to power about one light bulb.

The lecturer also notes that if this process were repeated a billion times (e.g., by having one billion people perform this task), the total energy consumption would be around 780 kilowatt-hours, which is still relatively small compared to other sources of energy.

Overall, the lecture aims to raise awareness about the environmental impact of website usage and design, and provide practical suggestions for minimizing energy consumption in web development.

Some key takeaways from this transcript include:

* The importance of analyzing CPU usage and identifying areas for improvement in website design
* The relatively small environmental impact of even small changes in website behavior or design
* The potential for collective action to minimize the environmental impact of computing at scale

This transcript can be used as a resource for learning about the environmental impact of website usage and design, and for discussing ways to minimize energy consumption in web development.

## Topic 2 summary Video• . Duration: 59 seconds 59 sec

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-web-development/lecture/Rvie1/topic-2-summary)

There is no text to summarize. The provided text appears to be a transcript of a video lecture or course material, and it does not contain any specific information or key concepts that need to be summarized.

However, I can provide a general summary of the context:

The text refers to a web development course and mentions the completion of Topic 2, which covers topics such as pausing an HTML document, understanding the document object model, interacting with the DOM structure, and calculating computational costs. The course also touches on environmental impact related to computing at scale.

If you provide the actual text or content that needs to be summarized, I'll be happy to assist you in condensing it into 8 sentences while preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details.

## Activity – Lab: Timing HTML parsing with JavaScript Reading• . Duration: 1 hour 1h

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-web-development/supplement/rTSiM/activity-lab-timing-html-parsing-with-javascript)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving all key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The task involves running the provided HTML and JavaScript code to parse HTML files, measure the parsing time, and compare the performance with different websites. To start, create a new folder for the project, add the provided HTML and JavaScript code to an index.html file, and open it in Visual Studio Code. Then, start Live Server and test the parsing code with a sample HTML file using the form on the webpage. Next, obtain full HTML from multiple websites by opening browser developer tools, copying the full HTML, saving it to a text editor, and creating an .html extension. Measure the parsing time for each website's HTML file by uploading the saved files to Live Server and noting the parsing time displayed. Record and analyze the parsing times for different websites by creating a table with the results, such as: Website Parsing Time (ms) example.com 45.23 newswebsite.com 87.34 socialmedia.com 102.56. Analyze the results by considering factors that might affect performance, like file size and DOM structure complexity. Finally, check off the completed tasks on the self-evaluation checklist to ensure all steps have been completed successfully.

The activity is designed to help practice CSS techniques described in the lecture video by completing challenges and extension activities. The first stage introduces CSS basics, including default styles applied by browsers, which can be customized using the `<style>` tag. In stage 2, participants create a simple webpage with an H1 heading, H2 heading, and paragraph, observing default styles applied by the browser. Stage 3 involves adding custom styles to change font size, color, and alignment of HTML elements. The fourth stage introduces CSS classes, which can be used to style multiple elements, while stage 5 focuses on colors using hex values, RGB, and RGBA. Stage 6 covers fonts, including changing font families and styles, and stage 7 involves creating an external CSS file named `styles.css` linked to the HTML document. The activity also includes a self-evaluation checklist to assess understanding and progress in mastering various CSS concepts.

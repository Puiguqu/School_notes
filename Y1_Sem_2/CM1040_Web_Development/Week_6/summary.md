## CSS grids Video• . Duration: 13 minutes 13 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-web-development/lecture/JahS6/css-grids)

The video on Introduction to CSS covers the basics of Cascading Style Sheets, including selectors, properties, values, units, inheritance, and box models.

Here is a summary of the key points covered in the video:

1. **Selectors**: A selector is used to target an element in an HTML document. Examples include class selectors, ID selectors, tag selectors, attribute selectors.
2. **Properties**: A property is used to specify a value for a style rule. Examples include color, font-size, background-color.
3. **Values**: A value is the actual content of a property. For example, in the color property, "red" is the value.
4. **Units**: Units are used to measure the size and length of elements. Examples include px (pixels), em, rem.
5. **Inheritance**: Inheritance allows properties to be inherited from parent elements. This means that if a child element has the same style as its parent, the child element will inherit those styles.
6. **Box model**: The box model is a fundamental concept in CSS. It describes an element as a rectangular box with four sides (top, right, bottom, left), and three dimensions (width, height, margin).

The video also covers some common pitfalls to avoid when working with CSS, such as:

* Using the wrong unit of measurement
* Not specifying a value for a property
* Not considering inheritance when writing styles

Overall, the video provides a solid introduction to the basics of CSS and sets the stage for more advanced topics in later lessons.

The practice assignment requires students to review the concepts covered in the video and apply them to a simple HTML document. The reading assignment provides additional resources for students to learn more about CSS, including model answers and resources for further study.

The activity is designed to help practice CSS techniques described in the lecture video by completing challenges and extension activities. The first stage introduces CSS basics, including default styles applied by browsers, which can be customized using the `<style>` tag. In stage 2, participants create a simple webpage with an H1 heading, H2 heading, and paragraph, observing default styles applied by the browser. Stage 3 involves adding custom styles to change font size, color, and alignment of HTML elements. The fourth stage introduces CSS classes, which can be used to style multiple elements, while stage 5 focuses on colors using hex values, RGB, and RGBA. Stage 6 covers fonts, including changing font families and styles, and stage 7 involves creating an external CSS file named `styles.css` linked to the HTML document.

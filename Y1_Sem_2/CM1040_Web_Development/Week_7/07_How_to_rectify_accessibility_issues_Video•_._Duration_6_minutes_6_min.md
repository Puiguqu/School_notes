The text discusses the process of identifying and rectifying accessibility issues on a website using an accessibility checker tool. The author, who is also the website owner, runs the checker on their own website and finds 10 known problems that can be easily fixed. The first problem identified is the lack of contrast between the foreground and background colors, which makes it difficult for users to distinguish between navigation and content. To fix this issue, the author reformats the navigation bar code, removes unnecessary attributes, and changes the background color to a more contrasting value.

The author then pastes the revised code back into the website and re-runs the checker, finding that two of the original problems have been fixed. The remaining eight problems are identified, including issues with document language not being identified for XHTML documents. To fix this issue, the author adds the necessary attributes to the HTML tag.

After making these changes, the author re-runs the checker again and finds that all 10 of the original known problems have been fixed, leaving only two unknown problems that need further attention. The video transcript concludes by highlighting the importance of regularly testing websites for accessibility using tools like this one.

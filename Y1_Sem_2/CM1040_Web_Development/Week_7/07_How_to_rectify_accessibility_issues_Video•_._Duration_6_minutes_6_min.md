The video transcript discusses the process of identifying and rectifying accessibility issues on a website using an accessibility checker tool. The creator runs the checker on their own website, which they acknowledge has not been updated in 20 years, and identifies 10 known problems that can be easily fixed. 

They begin by pasting the raw HTML code from the "view page source" option into the accessibility checker tool, ignoring external stylesheets to focus on basic layout issues such as contrasting foreground and background colors. The tool highlights a navigation bar with low contrast between link text and background color, which is then improved by removing unnecessary table attributes and adjusting background colors.

Next, the creator addresses another issue: adding language tags to HTML documents. Their website uses XHTML, which they decide to switch to, using a standard doctype like HTML5. They also address a third issue: identifying potential problems that require deeper analysis but can be fixed in future steps.

The video concludes by summarizing the process of rectifying accessibility issues identified by an accessibility checker tool, emphasizing the importance of careful reading and application of the provided recommendations to achieve success.

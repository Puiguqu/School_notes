The objective of this activity is to experience and reflect on the use of screen reader technology to navigate websites using different operating systems (Windows, Linux, and macOS). The instructions encourage users to choose their preferred screen reader and operating system and follow specific steps to navigate a website. On Windows, users can enable the Narrator feature by pressing Windows + Ctrl + Enter or searching for 'Narrator' in the Start menu. For Linux, users can start the built-in screen reader (Orca) by pressing Alt + Super + S or searching for 'Screen Reader' in system settings. macOS users can enable VoiceOver by pressing Command + F5 or going to System Preferences > Accessibility > VoiceOver and enabling it. Users are then required to navigate a website, typically the University of London website (https://london.ac.uk), using their chosen screen reader and note down any challenges encountered while navigating the site. After completing the exercise, users are asked to reflect on their experience, consider how web developers can address accessibility challenges, and identify one accessibility improvement for a frequently used website. This activity aims to provide hands-on experience with screen readers and promote better accessibility in web design.

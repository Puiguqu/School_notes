The objective of this activity is for participants to experience and reflect on using screen reader technology to navigate websites. Participants can choose their operating system and screen reader to use for this exercise. The instructions are as follows: Option 1 - Using a screen reader on Windows involves enabling the Narrator feature (Windows + Ctrl + Enter) and navigating the University of London website (https://london.ac.uk). Option 2 - Using a screen reader on Linux involves enabling the built-in Orca screen reader (Alt + Super + S) and navigating the same website. Option 3 - Using a screen reader on macOS involves enabling the VoiceOver feature (Command + F5) and navigating the University of London website using Safari. Participants are asked to note down any challenges they encounter while navigating the site using the screen reader and reflect on their experience. The activity also includes a reflection section where participants are asked to consider how web developers can address challenges and how they might change their approach to web design to ensure better accessibility.

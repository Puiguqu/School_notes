[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-web-development/supplement/J06BZ/activity-navigating-websites-using-limited-tools)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The objective of this activity is to learn how to navigate websites using only the keyboard and reflect on the impact of movement limitations on web accessibility. To achieve this, follow these steps: open your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge), navigate through interactive elements using Tab and Shift + Tab, and use Enter to select or click on links and buttons. Additionally, when encountering forms, use the Tab key to move between fields and input areas, and Space or Enter to check boxes or submit the form. After navigating a website without a mouse, reflect on any challenges encountered and consider improvements for keyboard navigation. Think about users with limited mobility in their hands or arms, such as those who may face additional challenges when navigating websites. Consider how websites could be made more accessible for users with limited mobility or dexterity, such as providing voice navigation or larger, easier-to-target clickable areas. Reflect on your experience and identify key improvements that could enhance keyboard navigation for people with movement impairments. By completing this activity, you will gain a better understanding of web accessibility challenges faced by users with movement limitations.

Note: I removed the links and references to specific websites and videos as they are not essential to the summary and may be subject to change.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The objective of this activity is to learn how to navigate websites using only the keyboard to understand accessibility challenges faced by users with movement impairments. To do this, participants will open their preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) and navigate a website of their choice (e.g., https://bbc.co.uk) using the Tab key to move forward through interactive elements and Shift + Tab to move backwards. Participants must use Enter to select or click on links and buttons. If there is a form on the page, participants can use the Tab key to move between fields and input areas, and Space or Enter to check boxes or submit the form.

After navigating the website using only the keyboard, participants will reflect on their experience, identifying challenges and areas of clarity. They must consider how movement limitations may impact web accessibility for users with limited mobility in their hands or arms, such as providing voice navigation or larger clickable areas. Participants should also think about improvements that could be made to enhance keyboard navigation for people with movement impairments. By completing this activity, participants will gain a better understanding of the importance of accessibility and how to improve website usability for users with movement limitations.

The activity is part of Lesson 7.1 on accessibility, which includes videos, practice assignments, reading activities, and a video on screen readers (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=your_video_id). The lesson aims to educate participants on the importance of accessibility and how to improve website usability for users with movement impairments.

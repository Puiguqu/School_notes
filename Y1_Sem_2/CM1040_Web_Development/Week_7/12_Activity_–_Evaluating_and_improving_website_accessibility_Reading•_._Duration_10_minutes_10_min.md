Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

Accessibility refers to the ability of people with disabilities to use websites and web applications. To evaluate the accessibility of a website, one can use accessibility testing tools such as ACHECKER or other alternatives. The process involves choosing a web page, running an accessibility checker, reviewing the results, making necessary changes, testing the changes, and reflecting on the process. Improving colour contrast between text and background, adding or adjusting attributes like lang for language or alt for images, and removing deprecated tags or attributes are common steps to address accessibility issues. For example, improving colour contrast can be achieved by using a style tag with specific code, such as `<style>.nav-bar { background-colour: #333; /* Darker background for better contrast */ colour: #fff; /* White text for contrast */ }</style>`. Addressing accessibility issues can improve the overall usability of a web page. Potential future improvements include adding ARIA attributes, restructuring content for better screen reader compatibility, or simplifying navigation to further enhance accessibility.

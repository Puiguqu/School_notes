Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The objective of this activity is to define accessibility and its importance in web design, using accessibility testing tools to evaluate and improve the accessibility of a website. The process involves choosing a previously created web page, running an accessibility checker, reviewing the results, addressing known problems, and re-running the checker to confirm resolution. The first step is to run the accessibility checker on a chosen web page, such as ACHECKER or another tool, by copying and pasting the HTML code into the checker's text area. The results will show a list of known problems identified by the checker, along with specific lines of code that need to be addressed. To address these issues, changes can be made to improve color contrast between text and background, add or adjust attributes like lang for language or alt for images, and remove deprecated tags or attributes with modern HTML5 equivalents. For example, improving color contrast can involve adding a style tag to set the background color to #333 and the text color to #fff. The process involves making necessary changes, testing them again, and iterating until there are no known problems identified by the checker. After addressing accessibility issues, it's essential to reflect on the process, identify potential issues, and plan for future improvements to enhance website accessibility further.

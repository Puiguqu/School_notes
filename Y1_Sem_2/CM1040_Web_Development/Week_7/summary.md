## Accessing websites: mobility Video• . Duration: 6 minutes 6 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-web-development/lecture/JojxD/accessing-websites-mobility)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The video discusses accessibility features for individuals with mobility disabilities, focusing on large navigation controls, highlighting, color customization, and ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes. Large buttons are important for users with mobility impairments, as they need to know where to click on a page using a mouse or keyboard. To address this, developers can use CSS classes to increase the size of buttons and apply padding, font sizes, and colors to make them more visible. Highlighting is also crucial when tabbing through a page, allowing users to identify which button they are about to activate. The tabindex attribute can be used to specify the order in which navigation items should be visited when using a keyboard, making it easier for users to navigate. Customizing fonts and colors can also enhance accessibility, with some developers opting for keyboard control modes that change CSS rules based on keyboard usage. ARIA attributes provide additional information about the purpose of different buttons on a screen, but their use can be complex due to conflicting standards between HTML and ARIA specifications. Despite these complexities, incorporating good practices from the web accessibility initiative into standard HTML can significantly improve accessibility, making it an essential consideration for developers.

## How to rectify accessibility issues Video• . Duration: 6 minutes 6 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-web-development/lecture/NhmA5/how-to-rectify-accessibility-issues)

The video transcript discusses the process of identifying and rectifying accessibility issues on a website using an accessibility checker tool. The creator runs the checker on their own website, which they acknowledge has not been updated in 20 years, and identifies 10 known problems that can be easily fixed. 

They begin by pasting the raw HTML code from the "view page source" option into the accessibility checker tool, ignoring external stylesheets to focus on basic layout issues such as contrasting foreground and background colors. The tool highlights a navigation bar with low contrast between link text and background color, which is then improved by removing unnecessary table attributes and adjusting background colors.

Next, the creator addresses another issue: adding language tags to HTML documents. Their website uses XHTML, which they decide to switch to, using a standard doctype like HTML5. They also address a third issue: identifying potential problems that require deeper analysis but can be fixed in future steps.

The video concludes by summarizing the process of rectifying accessibility issues identified by an accessibility checker tool, emphasizing the importance of careful reading and application of the provided recommendations to achieve success.

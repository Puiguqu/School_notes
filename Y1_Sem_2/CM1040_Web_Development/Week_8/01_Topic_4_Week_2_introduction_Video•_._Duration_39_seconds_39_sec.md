There is no text to summarize. The provided text appears to be a transcript of a video introduction to a lesson on usability, specifically discussing the differences between usability and accessibility. It does not contain any specific information, formulae, links, or technical details that can be summarized.

However, I can provide a summary of what the transcript likely discusses:

The lesson introduces the topic of usability and its difference from accessibility. Usability refers to the ability of a product or website to be easily understood and used by humans, while accessibility focuses on ensuring that products and websites can be accessed by people with disabilities. The lesson aims to explore different usability metrics, evaluate the usability of websites, and provide guidance on how to ensure that websites are usable for other humans.

If you could provide the actual text to summarize, I would be happy to assist you further.

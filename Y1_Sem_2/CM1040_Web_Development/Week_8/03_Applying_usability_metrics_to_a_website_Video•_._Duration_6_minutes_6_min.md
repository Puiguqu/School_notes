The System Usability Scale (SUS) is a widely used metric for measuring usability, developed by Johan Brookes in 1996. The scale consists of 10 questions, with odd-numbered questions asking users to rate their positive experiences and even-numbered questions assessing negative features. Users respond on a Likert scale from "strongly agree" to "strongly disagree." The SUS score is calculated by adding up the scores for positive and negative questions.

In this video, the presenter applies the SUS scale to an accessibility testing website. They answer each question based on their personal experience with the website, providing insights into the usability of the site. The results are mostly positive, with some minor criticisms regarding consistency in button design and navigation.

The SUS score ranges from 0 (very poor) to 100 (excellent). A commonly cited threshold for "good" usability is a score above 70. However, it's essential to note that the scale has its limitations and should be used in conjunction with other usability metrics and methods to provide a more comprehensive evaluation.

To apply the SUS scale effectively, users can answer each question based on their own experience with a website or application, considering factors such as ease of use, navigation, and overall satisfaction. By using this metric, organizations can identify areas for improvement and make data-driven decisions to enhance the usability of their products.

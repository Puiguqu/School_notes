The System Usability Scale (SUS) is a widely used metric for evaluating the usability of websites and other systems, created by Joachims Brookes in 1996. The SUS consists of 10 questions that users answer on a scale from strongly agree to strongly disagree, with odd-numbered questions being positive and even-numbered questions being negative. The scores can be calculated by adding up the positive scores and subtracting the negative scores, providing an overall usability score out of 100. 

The SUS evaluates various aspects of usability, including user confidence, ease of use, and learning requirements. In a worked example, the SUS was applied to the accessibility testing website, with the results suggesting that the site is easy to use, well-integrated, and not overly complex. However, some questions highlighted areas for improvement, such as lack of standardization in button functionality and inconsistent color scheme.

To apply the SUS to a given website, users can answer the 10 questions, which typically take around 5-10 minutes to complete. The results provide an initial indication of usability and highlight areas that need attention. While the SUS has limitations, it is a widely used and effective tool for evaluating the usability of websites and other systems.

The SUS is often used in conjunction with other usability metrics, such as user feedback and heuristic evaluations, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of website usability. Additionally, some studies have suggested that the SUS can be improved by incorporating additional questions or modifying the scoring system. Despite these limitations, the SUS remains an important tool for evaluating the usability of websites and other systems.

In terms of technical details, the SUS does not require any special software or equipment to administer, making it accessible to a wide range of users. However, some studies have suggested that using technology, such as clicker devices or online survey tools, can improve response rates and reduce bias in SUS results.

Overall, the System Usability Scale is an effective tool for evaluating the usability of websites and other systems, providing valuable insights into user confidence, ease of use, and learning requirements. By understanding how to apply the SUS effectively, designers and developers can create more user-friendly and intuitive websites that meet the needs of their target audience.

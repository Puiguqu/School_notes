Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The article "ISO 9241-11 Revised: What have we learnt about usability since 1998?" by Bevan et al. provides a review of definitions of usability. The authors discuss various standards and metrics for evaluating usability, including ISO 9241-11, which was revised in 2015. According to the article, usability is distinct from accessibility, although the two concepts are related. Usability can be defined as "the extent to which something satisfies the needs of its users" (ISO 9241-11). The authors also discuss the use of metrics such as time on task, error rates, and user satisfaction to evaluate usability. However, these metrics must be interpreted in context and applied appropriately to ensure accurate results. A self-evaluation checklist is provided in the article as a tool for evaluating website usability, although a detailed tutorial or practice assignment is not mentioned. The article can be searched online and accessed through Springer International Publishing.

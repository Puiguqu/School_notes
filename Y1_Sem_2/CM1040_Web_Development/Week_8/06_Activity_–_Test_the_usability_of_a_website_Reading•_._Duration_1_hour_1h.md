The System Usability Scale (SUS) is a reliable tool for measuring the usability of a system, consisting of ten questions with five response options. To apply the SUS scale, choose a website to evaluate, conduct a usability test by answering each question based on your experience using the provided scale. The questionnaire template includes questions such as "I think that I would like to use this system frequently" (1-5) and "I found the system very cumbersome to use" (8-10). To calculate the SUS score, subtract 1 from the score for positive questions (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) or subtract the score from 5 for negative questions (2, 4, 6, 8, 10), then add up the scores and multiply by 2.5 to get the overall SUS score. A SUS score above 68 is considered above average, while anything below 68 is below average. After conducting the usability test, analyze the results by identifying specific areas where the website scored particularly low or high and document your findings, including the overall SUS score and notable observations from individual question scores. The SUS scale provides a simple and effective way to evaluate the usability of a system, making it a valuable tool for designers and developers. By following these steps, users can apply the SUS scale to their own websites and identify areas for improvement to enhance user experience.

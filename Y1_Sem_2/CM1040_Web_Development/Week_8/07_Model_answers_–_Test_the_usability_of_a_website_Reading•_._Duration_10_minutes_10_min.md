There is no text provided for me to summarize. The given text appears to be a lesson plan or course outline, outlining the content and duration of various video lessons, practice assignments, readings, and a summary on usability. It does not contain any specific information about usability, accessibility, or technical details that I could summarize.

If you provide the actual text related to usability, accessibility, or website testing, I would be happy to assist you in summarizing it in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

To ensure understanding and capabilities are met, regular self-assessment is crucial throughout the course. This exercise helps reflect on learning journey, identify areas for improvement, and develop a plan for growth. The System Usability Scale (SUS) is used to evaluate websites, and users can accurately calculate and interpret SUS scores. Users have successfully applied SUS to assess website usability and identified specific areas for improvement based on testing results. To deepen understanding of these concepts, revisit relevant lecture videos, readings, and activities if needed. The importance of usability was discussed in a 12-minute video, which is also available as a practice assignment. A self-evaluation checklist is provided to help users assess their knowledge of key topics covered in the lesson. By using this checklist, users can identify areas where they need improvement and develop a plan for growth.

As you progress through your course, regularly assess your understanding against learning outcomes to reflect on your learning journey and identify areas for improvement. The exercise is designed to help you evaluate your knowledge and skills using the provided checklist. Usability refers to the quality of a website's interaction design, and it is essential for web developers to understand its importance. You can define usability and apply it by evaluating websites using the System Usability Scale (SUS), which you have successfully applied in the past. To accurately calculate and interpret SUS scores, you are expected to demonstrate proficiency in this skill. If you feel unsure about any concepts, revisit relevant lecture videos, readings, and activities to consolidate your knowledge. The checklist includes items such as defining usability, applying SUS metrics, and identifying areas for improvement based on usability testing results. By completing the self-evaluation exercise, you can develop a plan for improvement and refine your skills in web development.

## Topic 4 Week 2 introduction Video• . Duration: 39 seconds 39 sec

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-web-development/lecture/n2anV/topic-4-week-2-introduction)

There is no text to summarize. The provided text appears to be a transcript of a video introduction to a lesson on usability, specifically discussing the differences between usability and accessibility. It does not contain any specific information, formulae, links, or technical details that can be summarized.

However, I can provide a summary of what the transcript likely discusses:

The lesson introduces the topic of usability and its difference from accessibility. Usability refers to the ability of a product or website to be easily understood and used by humans, while accessibility focuses on ensuring that products and websites can be accessed by people with disabilities. The lesson aims to explore different usability metrics, evaluate the usability of websites, and provide guidance on how to ensure that websites are usable for other humans.

If you could provide the actual text to summarize, I would be happy to assist you further.

## What is usability and how do we evaluate it? Video• . Duration: 12 minutes 12 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-web-development/lecture/mZXVI/what-is-usability-and-how-do-we-evaluate-it)

The transcript appears to be a lecture or tutorial on the principles of usability, specifically discussing various sets of principles that have been developed over time to think about and reason about design for user interfaces. Here's a summary of the main points:

**Overview of Usability**

* The ISO definition of usability
* Overview of the course material

**Set 1: Nielsen's Principles (1990s)**

* Express system state
* Provide meaningful error messages
* Design dialogues to yield closure
* Offer informative feedback
* Enable frequent users to use shortcuts

**Set 2: Schneiderman and Pleasant's Principles (2000s)**

* Strive for consistency
* Enable frequent users to use shortcuts
* Offer informative feedback
* Design dialogues to yield closure
* Offer error prevention and simple error handling
* Permit easy reversal of actions
* Support internal locus of control
* Reduce short-term memory load

**Set 3: General Principles**

* Consistency across different sets of principles
* Relating the principles to each other
* Core themes that emerge across the different sets of principles

The lecture appears to be a comprehensive introduction to the principles of usability, covering various aspects of design for user interfaces. It provides an overview of the ISO definition of usability and discusses three sets of principles developed over time. The final section highlights the general principles that emerge from the different sets of principles.

Key takeaways include:

* Usability is different from accessibility
* Consistency is a crucial principle across various sets of principles
* Providing informative feedback, designing dialogues to yield closure, and offering error prevention are all important principles
* Supporting internal locus of control and reducing short-term memory load can also improve user experience

The lecture includes practice assignments, reading materials, and video resources for further learning.

## Applying usability metrics to a website Video• . Duration: 6 minutes 6 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-web-development/lecture/g87Hk/applying-usability-metrics-to-a-website)

The System Usability Scale (SUS) is a widely used metric for measuring usability, developed by Johan Brookes in 1996. The scale consists of 10 questions, with odd-numbered questions asking users to rate their positive experiences and even-numbered questions assessing negative features. Users respond on a Likert scale from "strongly agree" to "strongly disagree." The SUS score is calculated by adding up the scores for positive and negative questions.

In this video, the presenter applies the SUS scale to an accessibility testing website. They answer each question based on their personal experience with the website, providing insights into the usability of the site. The results are mostly positive, with some minor criticisms regarding consistency in button design and navigation.

The SUS score ranges from 0 (very poor) to 100 (excellent). A commonly cited threshold for "good" usability is a score above 70. However, it's essential to note that the scale has its limitations and should be used in conjunction with other usability metrics and methods to provide a more comprehensive evaluation.

To apply the SUS scale effectively, users can answer each question based on their own experience with a website or application, considering factors such as ease of use, navigation, and overall satisfaction. By using this metric, organizations can identify areas for improvement and make data-driven decisions to enhance the usability of their products.

## Topic 4 summary Video• . Duration: 46 seconds 46 sec

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-web-development/lecture/Vtdj5/topic-4-summary)

Unfortunately, there is no text to summarize in the provided prompt. The content appears to be a transcript and additional page content for an online course or tutorial on web development, specifically focusing on accessibility and usability.

However, I can suggest that the most important concepts and findings from the topic might include:

* Defining accessibility and usability
* Understanding legal frameworks and automated tools for testing accessibility
* Applying design principles and usability metrics to improve website accessibility
* Evaluating website usability using various techniques and tools

If you could provide more context or the actual text, I would be happy to assist you with summarizing it.

## Standard definitions of usability Reading• . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-web-development/supplement/sWukz/standard-definitions-of-usability)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The article "ISO 9241-11 Revised: What have we learnt about usability since 1998?" by Bevan et al. provides a review of definitions of usability. The authors discuss various standards and metrics for evaluating usability, including ISO 9241-11, which was revised in 2015. According to the article, usability is distinct from accessibility, although the two concepts are related. Usability can be defined as "the extent to which something satisfies the needs of its users" (ISO 9241-11). The authors also discuss the use of metrics such as time on task, error rates, and user satisfaction to evaluate usability. However, these metrics must be interpreted in context and applied appropriately to ensure accurate results. A self-evaluation checklist is provided in the article as a tool for evaluating website usability, although a detailed tutorial or practice assignment is not mentioned. The article can be searched online and accessed through Springer International Publishing.

## Activity – Test the usability of a website Reading• . Duration: 1 hour 1h

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-web-development/supplement/uCvKI/activity-test-the-usability-of-a-website)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving all key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The System Usability Scale (SUS) is a reliable tool for measuring the usability of a system, consisting of ten questions with five response options. To apply the SUS scale, choose a website to evaluate, conduct a usability test by answering each question based on your experience using the provided scale. The questionnaire template includes questions such as "I think that I would like to use this system frequently" (1-5) and "I found the system very cumbersome to use" (8-10). To calculate the SUS score, subtract 1 from the score for positive questions (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) or subtract the score from 5 for negative questions (2, 4, 6, 8, 10), then add up the scores and multiply by 2.5 to get the overall SUS score. A SUS score above 68 is considered above average, while anything below 68 is below average. After conducting the usability test, analyze the results by identifying specific areas where the website scored particularly low or high and document your findings, including the overall SUS score and notable observations from individual question scores. The SUS scale provides a simple and effective way to evaluate the usability of a system, making it a valuable tool for designers and developers. By following these steps, users can apply the SUS scale to their own websites and identify areas for improvement to enhance user experience.

## What is usability and how do we evaluate it? Video• . Duration: 12 minutes 12 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-web-development/lecture/mZXVI/what-is-usability-and-how-do-we-evaluate-it)

It appears that you provided a transcript of a video lesson on the topic of usability and its related principles. The lesson covers the following topics:

1. Introduction to usability
2. Usability vs. accessibility
3. Development of usability principles over time (Norman's, Nielsen's, and Schneiderman's lists)
4. Core themes in usability principles

The transcript includes a list of core themes that can be used as a starting point for designing usable user interfaces.

Here is a summary of the main points:

* Usability refers to the extent to which a system or product is easy to use and provides an effective interaction between the user and the system.
* The definition of usability has evolved over time, with various principles and guidelines being developed to help designers create more user-friendly products.
* Norman's list (1988) focused on 10 heuristics for user interface design.
* Nielsen's list (1995) built upon Norman's work and added new principles, including the importance of feedback and error prevention.
* Schneiderman's list (2000) introduced additional principles, such as designing dialogues to yield closure and offering informative feedback.

The core themes that emerged from these lists include:

1. Strive for consistency
2. Enable frequent users to use shortcuts
3. Offer informative feedback
4. Design dialogues to yield closure
5. Offer error prevention and simple error handling
6. Permit easy reversal of actions
7. Support internal locus of control
8. Reduce short-term memory load (related to recognition instead of recall)

These principles provide a foundation for designers to create user-friendly products that meet the needs of users.

The practice assignments and reading materials provided in the transcript can help learners apply these principles to real-world scenarios, such as testing the usability of a website or designing an interface that supports internal locus of control.

## Applying usability metrics to a website Video• . Duration: 6 minutes 6 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-web-development/lecture/g87Hk/applying-usability-metrics-to-a-website)

The System Usability Scale (SUS) is a widely used metric for evaluating the usability of websites and other systems, created by Joachims Brookes in 1996. The SUS consists of 10 questions that users answer on a scale from strongly agree to strongly disagree, with odd-numbered questions being positive and even-numbered questions being negative. The scores can be calculated by adding up the positive scores and subtracting the negative scores, providing an overall usability score out of 100. 

The SUS evaluates various aspects of usability, including user confidence, ease of use, and learning requirements. In a worked example, the SUS was applied to the accessibility testing website, with the results suggesting that the site is easy to use, well-integrated, and not overly complex. However, some questions highlighted areas for improvement, such as lack of standardization in button functionality and inconsistent color scheme.

To apply the SUS to a given website, users can answer the 10 questions, which typically take around 5-10 minutes to complete. The results provide an initial indication of usability and highlight areas that need attention. While the SUS has limitations, it is a widely used and effective tool for evaluating the usability of websites and other systems.

The SUS is often used in conjunction with other usability metrics, such as user feedback and heuristic evaluations, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of website usability. Additionally, some studies have suggested that the SUS can be improved by incorporating additional questions or modifying the scoring system. Despite these limitations, the SUS remains an important tool for evaluating the usability of websites and other systems.

In terms of technical details, the SUS does not require any special software or equipment to administer, making it accessible to a wide range of users. However, some studies have suggested that using technology, such as clicker devices or online survey tools, can improve response rates and reduce bias in SUS results.

Overall, the System Usability Scale is an effective tool for evaluating the usability of websites and other systems, providing valuable insights into user confidence, ease of use, and learning requirements. By understanding how to apply the SUS effectively, designers and developers can create more user-friendly and intuitive websites that meet the needs of their target audience.

## Activity – Test the usability of a website Reading• . Duration: 1 hour 1h

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-web-development/supplement/uCvKI/activity-test-the-usability-of-a-website)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving all key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The System Usability Scale (SUS) is a reliable tool for measuring the usability of a system, consisting of ten questions with five response options. To apply the SUS scale, select a website to evaluate and conduct a usability test, using the provided template or an online survey tool. Evaluate the website by interacting with it as normally and answering each question based on your experience. Calculate the SUS score by subtracting 1 from positive questions (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) and subtracting the score from 5 for negative questions (2, 4, 6, 8, 10), then adding up scores and multiplying by 2.5. A SUS score above 68 is considered above average, while anything below 68 is considered below average, with scores ranging from 0 to 100. Analyze individual responses to identify areas where the website scored particularly low or high, and consider aspects that could be improved based on feedback. Document findings by writing a short summary of usability test results, including the overall SUS score and notable observations. The goal of using the SUS scale is to gain insights into the usability of a system and identify areas for improvement.

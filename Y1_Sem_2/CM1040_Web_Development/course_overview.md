| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Logic Handling** | Uses JavaScript functions to handle logic (e.g., `if`, `for`) within templates | Uses a more limited set of tags for logic handling (e.g., `{{#if}}`, `{{^if}}`) | Uses inline JavaScript-like syntax with `${}` for logic handling |
| **Extensibility** | Highly extensible with plugins and a large ecosystem of tools | More limited extensibility compared to Handlebars, but still supports custom templates | Limited extensibility, but can be extended through the use of external libraries |
| **Partial Templates** | Supports partials (template fragments) using `{{>}}` syntax | Supports partials with a more complex syntax (`{{!}}`) | Does not support partial templates out-of-the-box, but can be achieved through external libraries or custom implementation |
| **Syntax Simplicity** | Has a relatively simple and consistent syntax | Has a simpler syntax compared to EJS, but may require more learning for beginners | Can be less intuitive due to its inline JavaScript-like syntax |
| **Ease of Use** | Generally considered easy to use, especially with its built-in plugins and tools | May require more learning for beginners due to its unique syntax | Can be less straightforward to use due to its inline JavaScript-like syntax and limited support for partials |
| **Client-Side Support** | Primarily designed for client-side use, with good support for browser-based rendering | Also suitable for client-side use, but may require additional setup for some features | More commonly used on the server-side, although can be adapted for client-side use |
| **Server-Side Support** | Good support for server-side rendering and Node.js integration (via Handlebars-Express) | Limited server-side support compared to Handlebars, but still suitable for some server-side applications | Primarily designed for server-side use, with good support for Node.js integration (via EJS-Express) |
| **Performance** | Optimized for performance and caching capabilities | Has a more lightweight approach to rendering and may be faster in certain scenarios | May have slower performance compared to Handlebars due to its inline JavaScript-like syntax |

This comparison table provides an overview of the key differences between these three template engines. Ultimately, the choice between them will depend on specific project requirements, personal preferences, and familiarity with each engine's ecosystem.

### Applying usability metrics to a website Video• . Duration: 6 minutes 6 min

The System Usability Scale (SUS) is a widely used metric for measuring usability, developed by Johan Brookes in 1996. The scale consists of 10 questions, with odd-numbered questions asking users to rate their positive experiences and even-numbered questions assessing negative features. Users respond on a Likert scale from "strongly agree" to "strongly disagree." The SUS score is calculated by adding up the scores for positive and negative questions.

In this video, the presenter applies the SUS scale to an accessibility testing website. They answer each question based on their personal experience with the website, providing insights into the usability of the site. The results are mostly positive, with some minor criticisms regarding consistency in button design and navigation.

The SUS score ranges from 0 (very poor) to 100 (excellent). A commonly cited threshold for "good" usability is a score above 70. However, it's essential to note that the scale has its limitations and should be used in conjunction with other usability metrics and methods to provide a more comprehensive evaluation.

To apply the SUS scale effectively, users can answer each question based on their own experience with a website or application, considering factors such as ease of use, navigation, and overall satisfaction. By using this metric, organizations can identify areas for improvement and make data-driven decisions to enhance the usability of their products.

### Standard definitions of usability Reading• . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information:

The article "ISO 9241-11 Revised: What have we learnt about usability since 1998?" by Bevan et al. provides a review of definitions of usability. The authors discuss various standards and metrics for evaluating usability, including ISO 9241-11, which was revised in 2015. According to the article, usability is distinct from accessibility, although the two concepts are related. Usability can be defined as "the extent to which something satisfies the needs of its users" (ISO 9241-11). The authors also discuss the use of metrics such as time on task, error rates, and user satisfaction to evaluate usability. However, these metrics must be interpreted in context and applied appropriately to ensure accurate results. A self-evaluation checklist is provided in the article as a tool for evaluating website usability, although a detailed tutorial or practice assignment is not mentioned. The article can be searched online and accessed through Springer International Publishing.

### Activity – Test the usability of a website Reading• . Duration: 1 hour 1h

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving all key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The System Usability Scale (SUS) is a reliable tool for measuring the usability of a system, consisting of ten questions with five response options. To apply the SUS scale, choose a website to evaluate, conduct a usability test by answering each question based on your experience using the provided scale. The questionnaire template includes questions such as "I think that I would like to use this system frequently" (1-5) and "I found the system very cumbersome to use" (8-10). To calculate the SUS score, subtract 1 from the score for positive questions (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) or subtract the score from 5 for negative questions (2, 4, 6, 8, 10), then add up the scores and multiply by 2.5 to get the overall SUS score. A SUS score above 68 is considered above average, while anything below 68 is below average. After conducting the usability test, analyze the results by identifying specific areas where the website scored particularly low or high and document your findings, including the overall SUS score and notable observations from individual question scores. The SUS scale provides a simple and effective way to evaluate the usability of a system, making it a valuable tool for designers and developers. By following these steps, users can apply the SUS scale to their own websites and identify areas for improvement to enhance user experience.

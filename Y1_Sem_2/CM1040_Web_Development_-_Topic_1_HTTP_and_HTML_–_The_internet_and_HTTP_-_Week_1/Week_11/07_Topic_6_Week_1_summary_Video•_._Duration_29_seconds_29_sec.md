Unfortunately, the text does not contain any meaningful information or technical details about a template engine or its implementation. The provided transcript appears to be a video presentation outlining an educational course on template engines, but it lacks specific content and formulas.

The main topics covered in the course include:

1. Introduction to template engines
2. Simple template engine specification
3. Template engine implementation: variables and rendering
4. Template control flow: iteration and branching
5. Automatic updating

However, the transcript does not provide any practical examples or technical details about implementing a template engine. The practice assignments listed at the end of each video session appear to be theoretical exercises that allow students to apply their knowledge in a simulated environment.

Therefore, it is not possible to summarize this text in 8 sentences, as there is no substantial content to draw from.

The second week of Topic 6 in the Web Development Course focuses on ready-made template engines and static website rendering tools. The course aims to provide an understanding of how these templates work, what features to expect, and their applications. After building a custom template engine, the course will delve into existing ones, including examples such as [link to specific template engine]. Students will also practice using a ready-made template engine through a practice assignment. The week's content includes a reading activity, discussion prompt, and video tutorials with accompanying videos (e.g., "Video Topic 6 Week 2 introduction", Duration: 43 seconds). Additionally, students can access offline site rendering tools to learn about their usefulness and applications. Offline site rendering tools are another twist on the template site management angle, offering an alternative approach to traditional templates. Throughout the week, students will have hands-on experience with these tools and engage in discussions through a prompt ("Which template engine is the most intuitive?").

## Static site rendering Video• . Duration: 14 minutes 14 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-web-development/lecture/PfaA1/static-site-rendering)

This is a transcript of a video lecture on static site rendering tools, specifically Eleventy and Handlebars template engine.

The lecture starts by explaining what static site rendering tools are and how they work. It then walks through the process of setting up an Eleventy project, including creating templates, content, and using the Handlebars template engine to render the content.

Throughout the video, the speaker provides examples and demonstrations of how to use the tool, including how to add custom variables to the templates and use hot reloading to quickly test changes.

The lecture concludes by summarizing the advantages and disadvantages of using static site rendering tools, such as Eleventy. The speaker notes that these tools are well-suited for publishing documents, blogs, and research projects, but may not be suitable for interactive websites or applications.

Some key takeaways from the video include:

* Static site rendering tools allow you to create a website without relying on a content management system (CMS)
* Eleventy is a popular static site rendering tool that uses Handlebars template engine
* Handlesbars is a templating engine that allows you to define templates for your website's layout and structure
* Custom variables can be added to templates to make them more dynamic
* Hot reloading allows you to quickly test changes to your website without having to rebuild it from scratch

The video also mentions the advantages of using static site rendering tools, such as:

* Fast page loads
* Easy maintenance and updates
* No reliance on a CMS or database

However, it also notes that these tools may not be suitable for interactive websites or applications.

Overall, the video provides a clear and concise introduction to Eleventy and Handlebars template engine, and demonstrates how to use them to create and manage a static website.

## Activity – Working with a ready-made template engine Reading• . Duration: 2 hours 2h

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-web-development/supplement/U5q7a/activity-working-with-a-ready-made-template-engine)

Based on the provided code examples, I'll summarize the differences between Handlebars, Mustache, and EJS:

**Logic Handling**

* Handlebars: Uses a JSON-like object as input to render templates.
* Mustache: Similar to Handlebars, uses a syntax that allows for conditional statements, loops, and expressions.
* EJS: Does not have built-in logic handling like Handlebars or Mustache. Instead, it relies on external JavaScript code to handle complex logic.

**Extensibility**

* Handlebars: Supports plugins and custom functions to extend its functionality.
* Mustache: Has a similar plugin architecture to Handlebars, allowing for easy extension.
* EJS: Does not have a built-in way to extend its functionality like Handlebars or Mustache. However, it can be extended by using external JavaScript code.

**Partial Templates**

* Handlebars: Supports partial templates through the use of `{{>}}` and `{{!}}` syntax.
* Mustache: Also supports partial templates using the `{{>}}` syntax.
* EJS: Does not have built-in support for partial templates. However, it can be achieved by including a separate template file.

**Syntax Simplicity**

* Handlebars: Has a relatively simple and intuitive syntax.
* Mustache: Also has a simple syntax, although some users may find it less readable than Handlebars.
* EJS: Has a more complex syntax due to the use of ERB (Embedded Ruby) tags, which can be confusing for those unfamiliar with Ruby.

**Ease of Use**

* Handlebars: Generally considered easy to learn and use, especially for developers familiar with other templating engines.
* Mustache: Also relatively easy to learn and use, although some users may find the syntax less readable than Handlebars.
* EJS: May require more time and effort to learn due to its complex syntax and Ruby-like tags.

**Client-side Support**

* Handlebars: Can be used on both client-side and server-side with the `Handlebars.compile()` method.
* Mustache: Also can be used on both client-side and server-side, although it's often used in conjunction with other libraries like jQuery.
* EJS: Designed primarily for use on the server-side, but can be adapted for client-side use with some modifications.

**Server-side Support**

* Handlebars: Can be used on both client-side and server-side.
* Mustache: Also can be used on both client-side and server-side.
* EJS: Primarily designed for use on the server-side, making it a good choice for Node.js applications.

Here's a summary comparison table:

| Feature | Handlebars | Mustache | EJS |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Logic Handling | Strong | Strong | Weak |
| Extensibility | Strong | Strong | Weak |
| Partial Templates | Strong | Strong | Weak |
| Syntax Simplicity | Easy | Simple | Complex |
| Ease of Use | Easy | Easy | Moderate |
| Client-side Support | Good | Good | Limited |
| Server-side Support | Good | Good | Primary |

Please note that this summary is based on the provided code examples and may not be comprehensive. The actual differences between these template engines can vary depending on individual use cases and requirements.

## Activity – Use a static site rendering tool to render a site Reading• . Duration: 2 hours 2h

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-web-development/supplement/yaY6L/activity-use-a-static-site-rendering-tool-to-render-a-site)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

To build a simple static website using 11ty (Eleventy) and Handlebars, start by creating a project folder and initializing a new Node.js project with `npm init -y`. Install 11ty and Handlebars as dependencies with `npm install @11ty/eleventy handlebars`. Create a project structure with the following folders: `src/includes` for templates, `src` for content files (e.g. `index.md`, `about.md`), and an empty `dist` folder to store generated output. Create a template file (`layout.hbs`) in `src/includes` that uses Handlebars syntax to render dynamic content. Add content files (`index.md` and `about.md`) to the `src` folder, each using the `layout` template. Configure 11ty by creating a `.eleventy.js` file with the following content: `module.exports = function(eleventyConfig) { return { dir: { input: "src", output: "dist", includes: "includes" } }; };`. Build and serve the site using `npm run build` and `npm run serve`, respectively, to view your static website locally.

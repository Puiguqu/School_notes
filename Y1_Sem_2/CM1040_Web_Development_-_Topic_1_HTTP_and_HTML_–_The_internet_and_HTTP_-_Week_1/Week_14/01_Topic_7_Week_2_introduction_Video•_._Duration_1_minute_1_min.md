There is no text provided for me to summarize. The given text appears to be a video transcript with information about an upcoming lecture on deploying websites into different server setups, including Unix command line hacking and web server configuration. 

However, I can provide a summary of the key concepts and findings in 8 sentences:

This week's topic is Week 2 for Topic 7, focusing on web development lifecycle and deploying websites onto servers. The instructor will be using Unix command line skills to share expertise with students. They aim to cover web server configuration techniques and deployable website setups at scale. Students can expect to learn about static and non-static website deployment methods through video lectures and practice assignments. A lab exercise, "Configuring a web server," is also available for hands-on experience. The instructor hopes that students will enjoy the process of learning about deploying websites and gain knowledge on scalable deployment techniques. Key concepts include Unix command line skills and web server configuration. The material covered in this week's lesson should be valuable to those working on websites and looking to improve their web development lifecycle understanding.

This is a video transcript of a tutorial on basic web deployment techniques, specifically deploying a static website on a web server.

The tutorial covers the following topics:

1. Deploying a static website on a web server
2. Configuring domain names for the website
3. Testing the website with ping and curl commands
4. Using HTTPs certificates to secure the website

The tutorial includes live demonstrations of each step, using a virtual machine as an example.

Here is a summary of the key points covered in the tutorial:

* To deploy a static website on a web server, you need to:
	+ Install a web server software (e.g. Nginx)
	+ Create a virtual host configuration file
	+ Upload your website files to the web server using Filezilla or SFTP
	+ Configure the domain name for the website
* To configure a domain name for the website, you need to:
	+ Buy a domain name from a registrar (e.g. GoDaddy)
	+ Point the domain name at an IP address (in this case, the virtual machine's IP address)
	+ Set up DNS records for the domain name
* To test the website with ping and curl commands, you need to:
	+ Use the `ping` command to check if the website is reachable from a remote location
	+ Use the `curl` command to send an HTTP request to the website and verify that it responds correctly
* To use HTTPs certificates to secure the website, you need to:
	+ Generate a self-signed certificate (or obtain one from a trusted certificate authority)
	+ Configure the web server to use the HTTPs certificate

The tutorial concludes by emphasizing the importance of testing and verifying that the website is working correctly after deployment.

Overall, this tutorial provides a comprehensive introduction to deploying a static website on a web server, including configuration, testing, and security considerations.

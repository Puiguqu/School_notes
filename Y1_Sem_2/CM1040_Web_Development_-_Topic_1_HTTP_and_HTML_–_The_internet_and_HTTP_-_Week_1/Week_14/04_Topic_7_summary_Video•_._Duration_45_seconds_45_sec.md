# Topic 7 summary Videoâ€¢ . Duration: 45 seconds 45 sec

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-web-development/lecture/WUdN3/topic-7-summary)

There is no text to summarize. The provided text appears to be a video transcript and additional page content for an online course or tutorial, but it does not contain any specific information or data that can be summarized into 8 sentences.

However, I can provide a summary of the topics mentioned in the text:

The text discusses two main stages of the web development lifecycle: early stages (user requirement gathering, participatory design workshops) and late stages (deploying websites onto web servers, reverse proxies, and Dockerizations).

The course covers lesson 14.1 on basic web deployment techniques, 14.2 on non-static and scalable website deployment, which includes a video, practice assignment, reading activity, and self-evaluation checklist.

Additionally, the text mentions other topics related to website deployment and maintenance, including a practice assignment for website maintenance planning and a reading lesson for non-static and scalable website deployment practical work.

If you provide the actual text or content you'd like me to summarize, I'll be happy to assist you.

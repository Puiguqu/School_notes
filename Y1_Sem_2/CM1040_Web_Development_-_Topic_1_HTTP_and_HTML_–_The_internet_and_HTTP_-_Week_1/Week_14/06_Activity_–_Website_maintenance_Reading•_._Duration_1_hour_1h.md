To maintain a website, tasks should be performed at various frequencies. Content management tasks, such as updating static content and fixing broken links, should be done regularly (e.g., daily, weekly). Code optimisation, accessibility, and security measures should also be reviewed and updated frequently, including checking for outdated content, plugins, and browser compatibility. For scalability, load balancing, and caching strategies can be implemented with regular monitoring and backups to ensure database performance and uptime.

Automated testing and deployment using CI/CD pipelines can help streamline website updates, while blue-green and canary deployment strategies can minimize downtime. Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments should be performed to ensure strong access control and secure authentication. User feedback and analytics can help improve CTAs and user pathways, leading to better website performance.

It is essential to set up monitoring and logging systems to automate regular backups and test recovery plans. A comprehensive approach to website maintenance involves implementing these strategies to ensure a smooth and efficient online experience.

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-web-development/lecture/Z4ZgB/topic-8-summary)

Unfortunately, there is no text provided to summarize. The given text appears to be a transcript from a video or presentation about web development life cycle, project management techniques, and DevOps practices. It includes links to additional resources such as videos, practice assignments, readings, and a self-evaluation checklist.

If you could provide the actual text to be summarized, I would be happy to assist you in condensing it into 8 sentences while preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details.

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-web-development/supplement/SNpIn/code-review-reading)

There is no text to summarize. The provided text appears to be a course introduction or reading assignment with references to articles and videos related to version control, DevOps practices, and code review. It does not contain any specific information or key concepts that can be summarized.

If you could provide the actual text to summarize, I would be happy to assist you in condensing it into 8 sentences while preserving important details, formulae, links, and technical details.

Unfortunately, the provided text does not contain any technical details or key information about formulas, links, or specific concepts related to data and ethics in web development. The text appears to be a transcript of an educational video lesson, discussing the importance of data and ethics in modern web development, as well as providing guidance on user data lifecycle, presenting user data ethically, and managing user data.

However, I can summarize the main points of the lesson:

The lesson focuses on the key concept of data and ethics in web development. It emphasizes the importance of understanding what kind of data is gathered, ethical concerns, and legal constraints associated with data processing. The lesson also highlights the risks of non-ethical data handling, providing case studies of horror stories related to big data sets.

Additionally, the lesson provides guidance on user data lifecycle, presenting user data in an ethically correct way versus a less ethical way, and managing user data. It includes video lessons, practice assignments, reading materials, and a self-evaluation checklist for learners to assess their understanding of the topic.

Unfortunately, there are no specific formulas, links, or technical details mentioned in the text. If you have any further questions or would like me to clarify any points, please let me know!

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-web-development/supplement/Rvld3/ethical-data-collection-on-the-internet)

There is not enough information in the text provided to summarize or extract key information about data protection law in the UK. 

However, I can provide a general overview of the topics mentioned:

Data protection law in the UK is governed by various regulations and guidelines, including the UK GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and the Online Safety Act.

The UK GDPR outlines seven core principles: Lawfulness, fairness and transparency; Purpose limitation; Data minimisation; Accuracy; Storage limitation; Integrity and confidentiality (security); and Accountability.

The text also mentions other relevant articles and resources, such as the UK Government's "Data protection and your business" guide, Ofcom's approach to implementing the Online Safety Act, and a self-evaluation checklist for data collection on the internet.

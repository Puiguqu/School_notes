## Managing user data Video• . Duration: 6 minutes 6 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-web-development/lecture/49h1x/managing-user-data)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and concepts:

The video discusses managing user data, particularly in the context of children's data, and highlights the importance of transparency, consent, and security measures. The Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018 exposed a disturbing disregard for voters' personal privacy, leading to increased scrutiny of social media platforms, political parties, and data brokers. Researchers found that even limited access to Facebook data could predict characteristics and traits with high accuracy, raising concerns about data analytics technology. Secure data storage is crucial to prevent data breaches, which can result in accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure, or access to personal data. In the UK, individuals are required to report data breaches within 72 hours, and if likely to result in a high risk to individual rights and freedoms, they must also inform those affected. Children's online privacy is particularly vulnerable, highlighting the need for parental consent, secure data storage, and robust measures to protect minors' data. The video emphasizes the importance of ethical data collection practices, including obtaining user consent, implementing data protection measures, and monitoring compliance with privacy regulations. By prioritizing security, transparency, and children's online safety, individuals can help mitigate the risks associated with managing user data.

## Case study: Presenting user data Video• . Duration: 5 minutes 5 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-web-development/lecture/eKzsH/case-study-presenting-user-data)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The video discusses best practices for presenting user data on websites, focusing on principles from the UK GDPR such as lawfulness, fairness, and transparency. A case study is presented to illustrate good and bad practice, highlighting issues with excessive information exposure, lack of consent, and transparency. The bad practice example displays a user's real photo, name, address, phone number, and email without explicit consent, increasing the risk of privacy violation. In contrast, the good practice example allows users to choose an avatar for anonymity and only displays essential information, such as an anonymized username. The review section demonstrates the use of consent notices and emphasizes transparency by stating that the user has chosen to keep their real name and contact details private. Minimal data display is also emphasized, with only necessary information displayed on the profile page. The video aims to match abstract GDPR themes to concrete web design decisions, providing a simplified example of how to apply these principles in practice. By following best practices for presenting user data, individuals can protect users' privacy and ensure transparency and consent are obtained when necessary.

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences:

The course requires regular assessment of understanding and capabilities against learning outcomes to reflect on progress, identify areas for improvement, and develop a plan for growth. The user data lifecycle is a crucial concept to understand, including explicit and implicit data collection methods such as forms, sign-ups, cookies, and user behavior tracking. Collecting minimal user data is essential, aligning with legal and ethical obligations like the UK GDPR. Different types of data can be gathered, including personal, behavioral, and sensitive data, each requiring specific considerations for protection and handling. Storing and protecting user data requires secure storage, data encryption, and regular monitoring for breaches, as well as steps to mitigate risks and respond to breaches. Transparency and user consent are vital when displaying or using user data on websites, with examples of good and bad practices. The course covers real-world scenarios such as designing a user profile page or developing a data privacy policy, ensuring compliance and protecting users, particularly children, online. By applying these concepts, students can articulate steps necessary to ensure compliance and protect users, demonstrating their understanding of the importance of data protection and ethical considerations in the digital age.

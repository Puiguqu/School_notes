Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The speaker discusses the generation of audio speech and music, highlighting its relevance to web development and accessibility. Text-to-speech technology is particularly useful for enhancing website accessibility, especially for individuals with visual impairments. The speaker demonstrates a tool that can generate spoken descriptions of images, which can be used to provide an audio version of websites for users with visual impairments. Additionally, the tool can be used to generate music for websites, allowing creators to produce custom audio content without needing to purchase licenses or hire musicians. However, the accuracy and understanding of user prompts are still limitations of these tools. The speaker showcases a tool that uses generative AI models to create music, but notes that its capabilities are still evolving and may not always understand the nuances of user requests. The speaker also introduces a more advanced tool called "generator," which allows users to configure settings such as instruments, genres, energy levels, and vocal styles to create custom music tracks. Overall, these tools have the potential to revolutionize audio content creation for websites and provide new opportunities for accessibility and creative expression.

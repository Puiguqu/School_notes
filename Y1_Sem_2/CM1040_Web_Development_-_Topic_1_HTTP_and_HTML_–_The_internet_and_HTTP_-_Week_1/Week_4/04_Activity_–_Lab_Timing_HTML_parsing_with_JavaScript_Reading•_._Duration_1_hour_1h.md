Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving all key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

To complete this task, create a new folder called "HTML Parsing Lab" and open it in Visual Studio Code, then add the provided HTML and JavaScript code to an index.html file. The JavaScript code measures the parsing time of HTML files using the `performance.now()` function and compares the performance with different websites by uploading saved HTML files from various sites. First, start Live Server by clicking the "Go Live" button at the bottom of Visual Studio Code, then test the parsing code with a simple HTML file or create one for testing. Next, open browser developer tools by right-clicking on the page and selecting "Inspect" or pressing F12, and copy the full HTML from the website using the "Copy OuterHTML" option in the Elements tab. Save the copied HTML to a new file with an .html extension, such as "example.html". Then, upload the saved HTML files to Live Server and note the parsing time displayed for each file. Finally, record the parsing times in a table and analyze the results by comparing them and considering factors that might affect performance, such as the size of the HTML file and complexity of the DOM structure.

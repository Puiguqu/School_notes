Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details:

The activity is designed to help learners practice CSS techniques described in the lecture video. The challenges are divided into seven stages, each with a task or extension activity to reinforce understanding. In Stage 1, learners define CSS and observe default browser styles for an HTML document. In Stage 3, learners apply custom styles using the `<style>` tag, changing font size, color, and alignment. In Stage 4, learners create and apply CSS classes to style multiple elements, including identifiers and unique ID selectors. Learners also explore colors using hex values, RGB, and RGBA, and adjust font family, weight, and style. The activity culminates in creating an external CSS file (styles.css) linked to the HTML document using the `<link>` tag, allowing for consistent styles across multiple pages. The lesson includes a self-evaluation checklist to assess learners' understanding and progress in CSS skills, covering basic understanding, default and custom styles, font and text styling, CSS selectors and classes, advanced color and font styling, external stylesheets, and code organization.

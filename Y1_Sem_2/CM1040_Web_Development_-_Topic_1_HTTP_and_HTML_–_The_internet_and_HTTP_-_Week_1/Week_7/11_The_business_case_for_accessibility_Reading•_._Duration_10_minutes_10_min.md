# The business case for accessibility Readingâ€¢ . Duration: 10 minutes 10 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-web-development/supplement/S1trx/the-business-case-for-accessibility)

Unfortunately, the provided text does not contain any information or content that can be summarized. The text appears to be a collection of links and references to various learning resources related to web accessibility, but it does not present any new information or findings.

However, I can suggest some key concepts and resources related to web accessibility:

* The Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) is a standard for making digital content accessible to people with disabilities.
* The W3C provides guidelines and resources for creating accessible websites and web applications.
* Accessibility is defined as the practice of making digital content usable by everyone, regardless of their abilities or disabilities.
* Screen readers are software tools that can read aloud the text on a website, allowing users with visual impairments to navigate and access the content.

If you provide more context or information about what you would like me to summarize, I'll be happy to help.

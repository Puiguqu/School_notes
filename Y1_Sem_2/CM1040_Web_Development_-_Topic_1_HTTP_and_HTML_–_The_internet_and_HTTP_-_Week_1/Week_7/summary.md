## Accessing websites: mobility Video• . Duration: 6 minutes 6 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-web-development/lecture/JojxD/accessing-websites-mobility)

Here is a summary of the text in 8 sentences, preserving key information and technical details:

The video transcript discusses accessibility features for individuals with mobility disabilities, focusing on large navigation controls, highlighting, color customization, and ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes. Large navigation controls are designed to be easily clickable and visible, using classes to increase size and emphasize important elements. Highlighting is used to draw attention to the current element, making it clear which button or control is being selected when navigating with a keyboard. Color contrast and color customization are also crucial in ensuring accessibility, as certain colors may not be readable for individuals with visual impairments. A special "keyboard mode" can be implemented to make navigation easier for users with mobility disabilities, using CSS to adjust font sizes, colors, and highlighting. ARIA attributes provide additional information about the purpose of different buttons and controls on a webpage, allowing developers to create more accessible interfaces. While HTML5 has incorporated some good practices from the ARIA project, it can be complex and require deep knowledge to use effectively. Developers should be aware of these complexities and consider using ARIA attributes to increase accessibility, even if it means clashing with semantic HTML attributes.

## How to rectify accessibility issues Video• . Duration: 6 minutes 6 min

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-web-development/lecture/NhmA5/how-to-rectify-accessibility-issues)

The text discusses the process of identifying and rectifying accessibility issues on a website using an accessibility checker tool. The author, who is also the website owner, runs the checker on their own website and finds 10 known problems that can be easily fixed. The first problem identified is the lack of contrast between the foreground and background colors, which makes it difficult for users to distinguish between navigation and content. To fix this issue, the author reformats the navigation bar code, removes unnecessary attributes, and changes the background color to a more contrasting value.

The author then pastes the revised code back into the website and re-runs the checker, finding that two of the original problems have been fixed. The remaining eight problems are identified, including issues with document language not being identified for XHTML documents. To fix this issue, the author adds the necessary attributes to the HTML tag.

After making these changes, the author re-runs the checker again and finds that all 10 of the original known problems have been fixed, leaving only two unknown problems that need further attention. The video transcript concludes by highlighting the importance of regularly testing websites for accessibility using tools like this one.

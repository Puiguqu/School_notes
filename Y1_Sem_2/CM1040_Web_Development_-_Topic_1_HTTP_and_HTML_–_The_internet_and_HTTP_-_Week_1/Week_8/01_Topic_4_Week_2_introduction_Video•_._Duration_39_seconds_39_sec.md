# Topic 4 Week 2 introduction Videoâ€¢ . Duration: 39 seconds 39 sec

[Original lesson](https://www.coursera.org/learn/uol-web-development/lecture/n2anV/topic-4-week-2-introduction)

There is no text provided to summarize. The text appears to be a video transcript and additional page content related to a web development course (CM1040). It does not contain any technical information, formulae, links, or key concepts that can be summarized.

However, based on the context of the transcript, it seems that the topic is about usability in web development, specifically discussing its differences from accessibility and how to evaluate and ensure websites are usable for humans. If you provide the actual text, I would be happy to assist with summarizing it in 8 sentences while preserving key information, formulae, links, and technical details.

There is not enough information provided to summarize the text in 8 sentences, preserving all key information, formulae, links, and technical details. The text appears to be a link to an article on usability and its various definitions, as well as some online resources for learning about usability. However, without the actual content of the article, it is impossible to provide a summary.

If you could provide more context or the actual content of the article, I would be happy to help you summarize it in 8 sentences, focusing on the most important concepts and findings.

The System Usability Scale (SUS) is a reliable tool for measuring the usability of a system, consisting of ten questions with five response options. To apply the SUS scale, select a website to evaluate and conduct a usability test, using the provided template or an online survey tool. Evaluate the website by interacting with it as normally and answering each question based on your experience. Calculate the SUS score by subtracting 1 from positive questions (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) and subtracting the score from 5 for negative questions (2, 4, 6, 8, 10), then adding up scores and multiplying by 2.5. A SUS score above 68 is considered above average, while anything below 68 is considered below average, with scores ranging from 0 to 100. Analyze individual responses to identify areas where the website scored particularly low or high, and consider aspects that could be improved based on feedback. Document findings by writing a short summary of usability test results, including the overall SUS score and notable observations. The goal of using the SUS scale is to gain insights into the usability of a system and identify areas for improvement.
